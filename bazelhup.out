We will try to solve "Gregor and Cryptography":
https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1549/A

We will run:
  1. A program that does not compile.
  2. A program that runs successfully, but gives the wrong answer sometimes.
  3. A correct solution.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An invalid program is reported as not compiling:

Compilation failed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The bad solution passes a few tests but then fails.
Because we set stop_on_first_failure to True, we stop once we see a failure.
We are running on 4 threads, so it's possible that more than one failure occurs
before all threads stop.

Compilation succeeded
Test 0 passed.
Test 1 passed.
Test 2 failed.
Test 3 passed.
Test 4 did not run.
Test 5 did not run.
Test 6 did not run.
Test 7 did not run.
Test 8 did not run.
Test 9 did not run.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The good solution passes all tests.

Compilation succeeded
Test 0 passed.
Test 1 passed.
Test 2 passed.
Test 3 passed.
Test 4 passed.
Test 5 passed.
Test 6 passed.
Test 7 passed.
Test 8 passed.
Test 9 passed.
