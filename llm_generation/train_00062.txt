CODECHEF beatrice

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable initialization.** The developer may initialize the variables incorrectly, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, initializing `i` to `0` instead of `1` would cause the loop to iterate one less time than intended.
2. **Incorrect logic.** The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the algorithm, which could also lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may forget to check if the value has become negative, which could cause the algorithm to terminate prematurely.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** The developer may make an off-by-one error, which could cause the algorithm to skip or repeat a step. For example, the developer may forget to increment `i` by 1 after adding 1 to `num`, which would cause the algorithm to skip a step.
4. **Incorrect data type.** The developer may use the wrong data type for a variable, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, using an integer for a variable that should be a float could cause the algorithm to produce incorrect results.
5. **Memory errors.** The developer may not allocate enough memory for the variables, which could cause the program to crash. For example, the developer may not allocate enough memory for the string `str`, which could cause the program to crash when it tries to access the string.
6. **Synchronization errors.** The developer may not use synchronization mechanisms correctly, which could lead to incorrect results or deadlocks. For example, the developer may not use a lock to protect a shared resource, which could cause two threads to modify the resource at the same time and produce incorrect results.
7. **Security vulnerabilities.** The developer may introduce security vulnerabilities into the code, which could allow attackers to exploit the program. For example, the developer may not properly validate user input, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the program.

Title:
CODECHEF flow017

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect comparison:** The developer may compare the numbers incorrectly, resulting in the wrong answer. For example, they may compare `A` and `B` and then compare the result with `C`, instead of comparing `A` and `C` and then comparing the result with `B`.
2. **Off-by-one error:** The developer may forget to add 1 to the index of the second largest number when printing it out. For example, if the second largest number is at index 2, the developer may print out the number at index 1 instead.
3. **Incorrect logic:** The developer may use incorrect logic to find the second largest number. For example, they may try to find the second largest number by starting with the smallest number and then iteratively comparing it with the other numbers, instead of starting with the largest number and then iteratively comparing it with the other numbers.
4. **Incorrect data type:** The developer may use the wrong data type to store the numbers, resulting in incorrect results. For example, they may use `int` to store the numbers, even though some of the numbers may be larger than `int` can represent.

Title:
CODECHEF lincan

Pain points:
* **Incorrect input format**. The input format specified in the problem statement is not followed correctly. For example, the input `3` should be `3` instead of `3 `.
* **Incorrect output format**. The output format specified in the problem statement is not followed correctly. For example, the output `12` should be `12` instead of `12`.
* **Incorrect logic**. The logic used to solve the problem is incorrect. For example, the following logic is incorrect:

```
def solve(n, candies):
  # This logic is incorrect because it does not consider the case where the candies cannot be distributed equally.
  if sum(candies) % n == 0:
    return sum(candies) // n
  else:
    return -1
```

The correct logic should be:

```
def solve(n, candies):
  # This logic correctly checks whether the candies can be distributed equally.
  if sum(candies) % n == 0:
    return sum(candies) // n
  else:
    return -1
```

* **Memory errors**. The program may run out of memory if it is not designed to handle large inputs. For example, the following program may run out of memory if the input is large:

```
def solve(n, candies):
  # This program may run out of memory if the input is large because it creates a list of all the candies.
  candies = [candies[i] for i in range(n)]
  return sum(candies) // n
```

The correct program should be:

```
def solve(n, candies):
  # This program does not create a list of all the candies, so it is less likely to run out of memory.
  return sum(candies) // n
```

* **Time errors**. The program may take too long to run if it is not designed to handle large inputs. For example, the following program may take too long to run if the input is large:

```
def solve(n, candies):
  # This program may take too long to run if the input is large because it iterates through the candies list multiple times.
  for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
      if candies[i] > candies[j]:
        candies[i], candies[j] = candies[j], candies[i]
  return sum(candies) // n
```

The correct program should be:

```
def solve(n, candies):
  # This program does not iterate through the candies list multiple times, so it is less likely to take too long to run.
  candies.sort()
  return sum(candies) // n
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 1010_D. Mars rover

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of strings. When we try to iterate over the list, we need to make sure that the data type of each element is a string. Otherwise, we will get a `TypeError`.

```python
for item in data:
  # This will raise a TypeError
  print(item + 1)
```

To fix this, we can use the `type()` function to check the data type of each element. If the data type is not a string, we can raise an error.

```python
for item in data:
  if type(item) != str:
    raise TypeError("Each element of the list must be a string")
  # This will work
  print(item + 1)
```

**2. Using incorrect index**

When we iterate over a list, we need to make sure that the index is within the bounds of the list. Otherwise, we will get a `IndexError`.

```python
data = ["a", "b", "c"]

# This will raise an IndexError
print(data[3])
```

To fix this, we can use the `len()` function to get the length of the list. Then, we can make sure that the index is less than the length of the list.

```python
data = ["a", "b", "c"]

# This will work
print(data[2])
```

**3. Using incorrect operators**

When we are working with logical operators, we need to make sure that we are using the correct operators. For example, we cannot use the `+` operator to add two boolean values.

```python
a = True
b = False

# This will raise a TypeError
print(a + b)
```

To fix this, we can use the `and` operator to combine two boolean values.

```python
a = True
b = False

# This will work
print(a and b)
```

**4. Not handling edge cases**

When we are writing code, we need to make sure that we handle all of the possible edge cases. For example, we need to make sure that we handle the case where the input data is empty.

```python
def get_data():
  # This will raise an EOFError if the input data is empty
  return input()

# This will work
def get_data():
  data = input()
  if data == "":
    return []
  else:
    return data.split()
```

**5. Using incorrect variable names**

When we are writing code, we need to make sure that we use descriptive variable names. This will make our code easier to read and understand.

```python
a = 10
b = 20

# This is not a good variable name
c = a + b

# This is a better variable name
sum = a + b
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 1057_A. Bmail Computer Network

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type for the number of routers.** The input specifies that the number of routers is an integer between 2 and 200,000. However, if the developer uses a data type that is too small, such as a short or an int, they may encounter an overflow error. To avoid this, the developer should use a long data type.
2. Using an incorrect data type for the indices of the routers. The input specifies that the indices of the routers are integers between 1 and n. However, if the developer uses a data type that is too small, such as a short or an int, they may encounter an out-of-bounds error. To avoid this, the developer should use a long data type.
3. Using an incorrect algorithm to find the path from the first to the last router. The naive algorithm for finding the path is to start at the first router and then follow the connections to the next router, and so on. However, this algorithm will not work if there is a cycle in the network. To avoid this, the developer should use a more sophisticated algorithm, such as a depth-first search or a breadth-first search.
4. Not handling the case where there is no path from the first to the last router. The input specifies that there must be a path from the first to the last router. However, if there is no such path, the developer's algorithm may crash or produce an incorrect output. To avoid this, the developer should check for the existence of a path before attempting to find it.
5. Not handling the case where the input is malformed. The input may be malformed in a number of ways, such as containing invalid characters or having the wrong number of elements. The developer should check for malformed input and handle it appropriately.
6. Not handling the case where the output is too long. The output may be too long for the developer to print it to the console. To avoid this, the developer should use a file to store the output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 107_E. Darts

Pain points:
**1. Input data**

The input data is a list of n integers, where n is the number of photos on the wall. Each photo is described by 8 integers, which are the coordinates of the 4 vertices of the photo. The coordinates are given in either clockwise or counterclockwise order.

The input data can be incorrect in several ways. For example, the number of photos can be less than 1 or greater than 500. The coordinates of the photos can be invalid (e.g., negative or greater than 104). The coordinates of the photos can be given in the wrong order.

**2. Algorithm**

The algorithm to find the expected score of Fatma's throw is as follows:

1. Create a list of all the photos on the wall.
2. For each photo, calculate the area of the photo.
3. Calculate the total area of all the photos.
4. Calculate the probability that the dart will hit a photo.
5. Multiply the probability by the expected score of the throw if the dart hits a photo.
6. Add the result to the total expected score.

**3. Output**

The output should be the expected score of Fatma's throw. The answer will be accepted if it has absolute or relative error not exceeding 10-6.

**4. Bugs**

There are several possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem.

* The input data may be incorrect. The developer must check the input data for errors and handle them appropriately.
* The algorithm may be incorrect. The developer must carefully verify the algorithm to ensure that it is correct.
* The output may be incorrect. The developer must carefully check the output to ensure that it is correct.

**5. Tips**

To avoid bugs, the developer should carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements. The developer should also carefully design the algorithm and test it thoroughly.

CODEFORCES 1120_D. Power Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of DFS.** The DFS function should visit all vertices of the tree, but it may miss some vertices if the implementation is incorrect.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum cost.** The minimum cost should be the minimum of the costs of all vertices, but it may be incorrect if the calculation is incorrect.
3. **Incorrect identification of the vertices that belong to at least one optimal set.** The vertices that belong to at least one optimal set should be the vertices that are visited by the DFS function, but it may be incorrect if the implementation of DFS is incorrect.
4. **Incorrect output.** The output should be two integers: the minimum cost and the number of vertices that belong to at least one optimal set. The output may be incorrect if the implementation of the output function is incorrect.
5. **Incorrect input.** The input should be a sequence of integers, but it may be incorrect if the input is not formatted correctly.
6. **Incorrect error handling.** The program should handle errors gracefully, but it may crash if an error occurs.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design the algorithm and to implement it correctly. It is also important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly.

CODEFORCES 1187_D. Subarray Sorting

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The input data may be of the wrong type. For example, the numbers may be entered as strings instead of integers. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic of the program may be incorrect. For example, the program may not correctly check if the array b can be obtained by sorting the array a. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are common in programming. This occurs when the programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output.

**5. Undefined behavior**

Undefined behavior occurs when the program does something that is not defined by the programming language. This can happen when the programmer uses a function in a way that is not intended, or when the programmer accesses memory that is not allocated. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**6. Memory leaks**

Memory leaks occur when the programmer allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.

**7. Race conditions**

Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output or crash.

**8. Deadlocks**

Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely.

**9. Security vulnerabilities**

Security vulnerabilities can occur when the programmer does not properly secure the program. This can allow attackers to access sensitive data or take control of the program.

CODEFORCES 1206_C. Almost Equal

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be a single integer n. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single line containing the string "YES" or "NO". If the output format is incorrect, the program will not pass the test cases.
3. **Incorrect solution**. The solution must satisfy the following condition: for every n consecutive numbers on the circle, the sum of their values must differ by at most 1. If the solution does not satisfy this condition, the program will not pass the test cases.
4. **Incorrect reasoning**. The program must reason about the problem correctly in order to find a solution. If the reasoning is incorrect, the program will not find a solution or will find an incorrect solution.
5. **Incorrect implementation**. The program must be implemented correctly in order to find a solution. If the implementation is incorrect, the program will not find a solution or will find an incorrect solution.

Here are some tips to avoid these problems:

1. Carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand the input and output formats.
2. Write a test case for the problem and make sure your program passes the test case.
3. Debug your program carefully and make sure there are no errors.
4. Ask for help from a mentor or other experienced programmer if you are stuck.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1223_F. Stack Exterminable Arrays

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect implementation of the stack data structure.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. Make sure that your stack implementation correctly handles all of the following operations: push, pop, top, and empty.
* **Incorrect use of the stack.** The stack is a powerful tool, but it can be easy to misuse. Make sure that you are using the stack in a way that is consistent with the problem definition. For example, you should not push an element to the stack if it is already on the stack.
* **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common source of bugs in programming. Make sure that you are correctly calculating the indices of elements in the stack and the array.
* **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement specifies a few edge cases that you need to handle correctly. Make sure that you are not missing any of these cases.
* **Memory leaks.** Memory leaks can occur when you allocate memory but do not free it when you are finished with it. This can lead to your program running out of memory and crashing. Make sure that you are freeing any memory that you allocate.
* **Incorrect time complexity.** The problem statement specifies a time complexity of O(n). Make sure that your solution is actually O(n).
* **Incorrect space complexity.** The problem statement specifies a space complexity of O(n). Make sure that your solution is actually O(n).

Title:
CODEFORCES 1419_F. Rain of Fire

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data contains integers with a large range. If we use an incorrect data type, such as `int`, to store the coordinates of the detachments, we may get incorrect results. For example, if we use `int` to store the coordinates of a detachment with a large absolute value, such as `10^9`, the value will be truncated to `2147483647`, which is not enough to represent the actual coordinate.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the minimum value of `t` such that Brimstone can check all the detachments. A naive algorithm is to try all possible values of `t` from 1 to `10^9`. However, this algorithm is too slow. A more efficient algorithm is to sort the detachments by their x-coordinates, and then check if it is possible to check all the detachments by moving from left to right. If it is not possible, we sort the detachments by their y-coordinates and check if it is possible to check all the detachments by moving from top to bottom. If it is still not possible, then the answer is `-1`.

**3. Incorrect implementation**

Even if we use the correct data type and algorithm, we may still get incorrect results if our implementation is incorrect. For example, we may forget to initialize a variable to a default value, or we may make a mistake in a calculation.

**4. Not handling special cases**

The problem statement mentions that the detachments are placed in different points. However, it is possible that the input data contains duplicate coordinates. If we do not handle this special case correctly, we may get incorrect results.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it to the judge. This will help you to catch errors in your code and make sure that it is correct.

CODEFORCES 1462_E1. Close Tuples (easy version)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem states that the first line of the input should contain a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of test cases. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem states that the output should contain t answers to the given test cases. Each answer is the required number of triples of elements, such that the maximum value in the triple differs from the minimum by no more than 2. Note that in difference to the hard version of the problem, you don't need to output the answer by modulo. You must output the exact value of the answer. If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly output the answer and will likely receive a incorrect verdict.
3. **Incorrect data type**. The problem states that the input consists of integers from 1 to n. If the input contains non-integer values, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The problem states that the maximum value in the triple differs from the minimum by no more than 2. This means that the maximum value in the triple can be 2 greater than the minimum value, or 1 less than the minimum value. If the program does not correctly account for this, it will likely output an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect algorithm**. The problem can be solved using a simple algorithm that counts the number of triples of elements such that the maximum value in the triple differs from the minimum by no more than 2. However, if the algorithm is not implemented correctly, it may not be able to correctly count the number of triples and will likely output an incorrect answer.
6. **Memory leaks**. The program should be careful not to allocate more memory than it needs. If the program allocates too much memory, it may crash or run out of memory.
7. **Synchronization issues**. If the program is multi-threaded, it must be careful to synchronize access to shared data structures. If the program does not synchronize access to shared data structures correctly, it may produce incorrect results or crash.
8. **Race conditions**. If the program is multi-threaded, it must be careful to avoid race conditions. A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same shared data structure at the same time. If the program does not avoid race conditions correctly, it may produce incorrect results or crash.
9. **Deadlocks**. If the program is multi-threaded, it must be careful to avoid deadlocks. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. If the program does not avoid deadlocks correctly, it may hang or crash.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer x, which is the minimum number of ones required to represent n. If the output is not in the correct format, the program will not be accepted by the judge.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem must be correct in order to find the minimum number of ones required to represent n. If the algorithm is incorrect, the program will not be able to find the correct answer.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. The program must be implemented correctly in order to correctly solve the problem. If the implementation is incorrect, the program will not be able to find the correct answer.
5. **Runtime error**. The program must be able to run to completion in the time limit specified by the judge. If the program runs into a runtime error, it will not be able to finish running and will not be accepted by the judge.
6. **Memory error**. The program must not use more memory than the amount specified by the judge. If the program uses too much memory, it will be terminated by the judge and will not be accepted.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

1. Carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand what is being asked.
2. Test your program on a variety of input values to make sure it is working correctly.
3. Use a debugging tool to help you identify and fix errors in your program.

CODEFORCES 1511_C. Yet Another Card Deck

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is as follows:

```
n q
a_1 a_2 ... a_n
t_1 t_2 ... t_q
```

where:

* `n` and `q` are the number of cards in the deck and the number of queries, respectively.
* `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` are the colors of the cards in the deck.
* `t_1`, `t_2`, ..., `t_q` are the query colors.

If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will likely crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is as follows:

```
p_1 p_2 ... p_q
```

where:

* `p_1`, `p_2`, ..., `p_q` are the positions of the cards that were found in the queries.

If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will likely receive a wrong answer.

**3. Incorrect data type**

The data types of the input and output values must be correct. For example, the input values `n` and `q` must be integers, and the output values `p_1`, `p_2`, ..., `p_q` must be integers. If the data types are incorrect, the program will not be able to process the data correctly and will likely crash.

**4. Memory errors**

The program may run out of memory if it is not careful about how it allocates and frees memory. This can happen if the program allocates too much memory, or if it does not free memory that it is no longer using. Memory errors can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect results.

**5. Race conditions**

A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or to crash. To avoid race conditions, the program must use synchronization mechanisms to ensure that only one thread can access the data at a time.

**6. Deadlocks**

A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely. To avoid deadlocks, the program must ensure that no thread ever waits for a resource that it already holds.

**7. Incorrect algorithm**

The program may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or to run in an inefficient manner.

**8. Incorrect implementation**

The program may be incorrectly implemented, even if the algorithm is correct. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or to run in an inefficient manner.

**9. Testing errors**

The program may not be tested thoroughly enough. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or to crash in unexpected ways. To avoid testing errors, the program must be tested with a variety of input data and with a variety of different scenarios.

**10. Documentation errors**

The program's documentation may be incorrect or incomplete. This can make it difficult for other developers to understand how the program works and to use it correctly. To avoid documentation errors, the program's documentation must be clear, concise, and complete.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1539_A. Contest Start

Pain points:

 The third participant finishes at time 10. So the dissatisfaction of the second and third participant is 1.

1. **Incorrect variable type.** The input variables are integers, but the developer might accidentally use a floating-point type. This would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
2. **Off-by-one error.** The developer might accidentally calculate the start time or end time of the contest incorrectly. This would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect loop condition.** The developer might accidentally use the wrong loop condition, which would cause the program to iterate over the wrong range of values. This would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect formula.** The developer might accidentally use the wrong formula to calculate the sum of dissatisfaction. This would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect output format.** The developer might accidentally print the output in the wrong format. This would cause the program to produce incorrect results.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. The developer should also carefully check their code for errors before running it.

Title:
CODEFORCES 165_C. Another Problem on Strings

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format for this problem is `k`, followed by a binary string `s`. However, some developers may accidentally write the input format as `k, s`. This will cause the program to crash because it will not be able to parse the input correctly.

### 2. Incorrect use of substrings

A substring is a part of a string that is extracted from the original string by specifying the start and end indices. For example, the substring of the string `"abc"` starting at index 1 and ending at index 3 is `"bc"`.

Some developers may incorrectly use substrings by specifying the start index as greater than the end index. This will cause the program to crash because it will not be able to find the substring.

### 3. Incorrect use of `count()`

The `count()` method in Python returns the number of occurrences of a substring in a string. For example, the following code will print the number of occurrences of the substring `"1"` in the string `"1010"`:

```python
print(s.count("1"))
```

Some developers may incorrectly use the `count()` method by passing an invalid substring. This will cause the program to crash because it will not be able to find the substring.

### 4. Incorrect use of `for` loops

The `for` loop in Python iterates over a sequence of elements. For example, the following code will print the numbers from 1 to 10:

```python
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
```

Some developers may incorrectly use the `for` loop by iterating over an empty sequence. This will cause the program to crash because there will be no elements to iterate over.

### 5. Incorrect use of `if` statements

The `if` statement in Python checks if a condition is true. If the condition is true, the code inside the `if` block will be executed. For example, the following code will print the message `"Hello world"` if the variable `x` is equal to 1:

```python
if x == 1:
    print("Hello world")
```

Some developers may incorrectly use the `if` statement by checking for an invalid condition. This will cause the program to crash because the condition will never be true.

**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to read the document identifier, or if you read the document identifier incorrectly, your program will not work correctly.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format for this problem is also very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if you print the wrong number, or if you print the number in the wrong format, your program will not work correctly.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic for this problem is not very complex, but it is still possible to make a mistake. For example, if you forget to check if the document identifier is valid, or if you forget to check if the document text is valid, your program will not work correctly.
* **Runtime errors:** This problem is not very computationally intensive, so runtime errors are not very common. However, it is still possible to make a mistake that causes your program to run out of memory or time.
* **Memory errors:** This problem is not very memory intensive, so memory errors are not very common. However, it is still possible to make a mistake that causes your program to run out of memory.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* **Be careful when reading the input:** Make sure that you read the input carefully and correctly.
* **Be careful when writing the output:** Make sure that you write the output in the correct format.

CODEFORCES 232_E. Quick Tortoise

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be in the wrong format, such as a string instead of an integer. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating over a list or array, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one element or count one element twice. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, such as using the wrong variable or forgetting to check for a boundary condition. This can also lead to incorrect results.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program may not properly release memory that it has allocated, which can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
5. **Race conditions**. When multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is possible for one thread to overwrite data that another thread is currently using. This can lead to incorrect results or even a crash.
6. **Deadlocks**. When two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, they can deadlock and the program will not be able to continue.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may be vulnerable to attacks such as buffer overflows or SQL injection. This can allow an attacker to gain control of the program or access sensitive data.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully test your code and use a debugger to find any errors. It is also important to use a secure coding methodology to minimize the risk of security vulnerabilities.

Title:
CODEFORCES 398_E. Sorting Permutations

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the sorting algorithm.** The most common mistake is to use a sorting algorithm that is not stable. This means that the order of equal elements in the input array is not preserved in the output array. This can lead to incorrect results if the input array contains any holes.
2. **Incorrect handling of the holes.** The holes in the input array can be handled in a number of ways. One common approach is to simply ignore them and sort the remaining elements. However, this can lead to incorrect results if the holes are located in such a way that they affect the order of the other elements.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of ways to sort the array.** The number of ways to sort an array can be calculated using a number of different techniques. One common approach is to use the Catalan numbers. However, this can be computationally expensive for large arrays.
4. **Modulo arithmetic errors.** When calculating the number of ways to sort the array, it is important to use modulo arithmetic to ensure that the results are correct. This is because the number of ways to sort an array can be very large, and it is possible for the results to overflow if they are not calculated modulo a large prime number.
5. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of mistake that can occur when programming. In this problem, off-by-one errors can occur when calculating the indices of the elements in the array, or when counting the number of ways to sort the array.
6. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The data structures used to store the input array and the output array can have a significant impact on the performance of the sorting algorithm. It is important to choose data structures that are appropriate for the problem being solved.
7. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** The algorithms used to sort the array can have a significant impact on the performance of the sorting algorithm. It is important to choose algorithms that are appropriate for the problem being solved.
8. **Incorrect use of libraries.** The libraries used to implement the sorting algorithm can have a significant impact on the performance of the sorting algorithm. It is important to choose libraries that are appropriate for the problem being solved.
9. **Incorrect use of the compiler.** The compiler used to compile the sorting algorithm can have a significant impact on the performance of the sorting algorithm. It is important to choose a compiler that is appropriate for the problem being solved.
10. **Incorrect use of the operating system.** The operating system used to run the sorting algorithm can have a significant impact on the performance of the sorting algorithm. It is important to choose an operating system that is appropriate for the problem being solved.

CODEFORCES 421_A. Pasha and Hamsters

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be in the format `n,a,b`, where `n` is the number of apples, `a` is the number of apples Arthur likes, and `b` is the number of apples Alexander likes. If the input is not in this format, the program will not work correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a string of `n` characters, each of which is either `1` or `2`. If the output is not in this format, the program will not work correctly.
3. **Incorrect data**. The input data should be such that the answer exists. If the input data does not satisfy this condition, the program will not be able to find a solution.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating through the input data, it is easy to make an off-by-one error and skip or repeat a value. This can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Memory leaks**. If the program does not free up memory that it is no longer using, it can eventually run out of memory and crash.
6. **Race conditions**. If multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time, it is possible for them to corrupt each other's data. This can lead to incorrect results or even a crash.
7. **Deadlocks**. If two threads are each waiting for the other to release a lock, they can deadlock and neither thread will ever be able to continue.
8. **Buffer overflows**. If a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, it can overwrite other data in memory. This can lead to security vulnerabilities or even a crash.
9. **Format string vulnerabilities**. If a program uses a format string incorrectly, it can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.
10. **SQL injection attacks**. If a program does not properly sanitize user input before using it in a SQL query, it can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL statements on the database.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is two integers, n and m, separated by a space. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce an incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of possible pairs.** The number of possible pairs of hours and minutes is equal to the product of the number of possible hours and the number of possible minutes. If the program incorrectly calculates either of these values, the output will be incorrect.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the number of possible hours or minutes, it is important to make sure that the range of possible values is correct. For example, if the number of hours is n, the range of possible values is 0 to n - 1, not 0 to n. If the program makes an off-by-one error, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic.** When calculating the number of possible pairs, it is important to use modulo arithmetic correctly. For example, if the number of hours is n and the number of minutes is m, the number of possible pairs is n * m (mod 7). If the program incorrectly uses modulo arithmetic, the output will be incorrect.
5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that could occur when solving this problem, such as incorrect variable initialization, incorrect logic, and incorrect use of functions. It is important to carefully check the code for any potential bugs before submitting it.

Title:
CODEFORCES 774_A. Amusement Park

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format specifies that the first line should contain three integers n, c1, and c2. However, if the input contains a different number of integers, the program will crash. For example, if the input contains the following four integers: 1, 2, 3, 4, the program will crash because it expects three integers.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The input format specifies that the first line should contain three integers n, c1, and c2. However, if the input contains any other type of data, such as strings or floating-point numbers, the program will crash. For example, if the input contains the following string: "1 2 3 4", the program will crash because it expects three integers.

**3. Incorrect output format**

The output format specifies that the output should be a single integer. However, if the output contains any other type of data, such as a string or a floating-point number, the program will crash. For example, if the output contains the following string: "1.234", the program will crash because it expects a single integer.

**4. Undefined behavior**

The program may also crash if it encounters undefined behavior. Undefined behavior is a situation in which the program's behavior is not specified by the programming language. For example, if the program tries to divide by zero, the behavior is undefined. This means that the program could crash, or it could produce any arbitrary output.

**5. Memory leaks**

The program may also leak memory. Memory leaks occur when the program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

**6. Race conditions**

Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results or crashing.

**7. Deadlocks**

Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can lead to the program being stuck in an infinite loop and crashing.

**8. Security vulnerabilities**

The program may also contain security vulnerabilities. Security vulnerabilities are flaws in the program that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or to the system on which it is running.

**9. Bugs in third-party libraries**

Title:
CODEFORCES 799_A. Carrot Cakes

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains four integers, but the developer may accidentally use the wrong data type for one of them. For example, they may use a `string` to store the number of cakes needed, or a `float` to store the time needed to bake a cake. This can lead to incorrect results.

**2. Not considering all possible cases**

The problem statement specifies that Arkady can't build more than one oven. However, the developer may accidentally forget to check this condition, and build two or more ovens. This will also lead to incorrect results.

**3. Using incorrect math**

The problem statement requires the developer to calculate the minimum time needed to get n cakes. To do this, they need to use the correct mathematical formula. For example, if the first oven can bake k cakes in t minutes, and the second oven can bake k cakes in d minutes, then the total time needed to bake n cakes is t + d + (n - k) / (k + k).

**4. Not handling errors correctly**

The problem statement does not specify what should happen if the input is invalid. For example, if the number of cakes needed is negative, or the time needed to bake a cake is zero, the developer may need to handle this gracefully.

**5. Not testing the code thoroughly**

It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly. This includes testing with different input values, and checking for edge cases.

By following these tips, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving the Carrot Cakes problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 891_A. Pride

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the `gcd` function.** The `gcd` function returns the greatest common divisor of two numbers. In this problem, we need to find the least common multiple of two numbers. The least common multiple of two numbers is the smallest number that is divisible by both numbers. To find the least common multiple, we can use the following formula:

```
lcm(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b)
```

2. **Not considering the case where all of the numbers in the array are equal.** If all of the numbers in the array are equal, then we can make all of the numbers equal to 1 by performing a single operation.

3. **Not considering the case where the array is empty.** If the array is empty, then we cannot make any operations and the answer is 0.

4. **Not handling negative numbers correctly.** The `gcd` function does not work correctly for negative numbers. If any of the numbers in the array are negative, then we need to take the absolute value of the numbers before we find the least common multiple.

5. **Not handling floating-point numbers correctly.** The `gcd` function does not work correctly for floating-point numbers. If any of the numbers in the array are floating-point numbers, then we need to round the numbers to the nearest integer before we find the least common multiple.

6. **Not handling overflow correctly.** The `gcd` function can overflow if the numbers in the array are very large. If this happens, we need to use a different algorithm to find the least common multiple.

7. **Not handling input errors correctly.** The input to this problem can be incorrect. If the input is incorrect, we need to handle the error gracefully.

8. **Not using efficient algorithms.** The algorithms that you use to solve this problem should be as efficient as possible. There are a number of different algorithms that you can use to find the least common multiple of two numbers. The best algorithm to use depends on the size of the numbers in the array.

9. **Not testing your code thoroughly.** It is important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. You should test your code with a variety of different input values to make sure that it handles all of the possible cases correctly.
Test inputs:

Title:
CODEFORCES 935_D. Fafa and Ancient Alphabet

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not very clear. It is not clear whether the numbers in the input should be separated by spaces or not. This can lead to errors if the developer does not correctly parse the input.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the probability**

The probability of S1 being lexicographically greater than S2 is given by the fraction P/Q, where P is the number of ways to replace the erased symbols in S1 so that it is lexicographically greater than S2, and Q is the total number of ways to replace the erased symbols in S1. The developer must be careful to correctly calculate both P and Q.

**3. Incorrect modulo arithmetic**

The answer to the problem must be a non-negative integer less than 10^9 + 7. The developer must be careful to correctly perform modulo arithmetic to ensure that the answer is in the correct range.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is not very clear. It is not clear whether the answer should be printed as a fraction or as a decimal number. The developer must be careful to correctly format the output.

**5. Runtime errors**

The developer must be careful to avoid runtime errors, such as running out of memory or stack space. This can be done by using efficient algorithms and data structures.

Title:
CODEFORCES 961_C. Chessboard

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always followed correctly. For example, the input may contain a non-integer number, or a number that is too large or too small. The developer should check the input format and raise an error if it is incorrect.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always followed correctly. For example, the output may contain a non-integer number, or a number that is too large or too small. The developer should check the output format and raise an error if it is incorrect.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the algorithm may not always find the optimal solution, or it may take too long to run. The developer should carefully design the algorithm and test it thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and efficient.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer may not free up memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to memory leaks, which can eventually cause the program to crash. The developer should use the `delete` keyword to free up memory that is no longer needed.
5. **Synchronization issues**. The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data. This can lead to race conditions, which can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash. The developer should use locks and mutexes to properly synchronize access to shared data.
6. **Exception handling**. The developer may not handle exceptions properly. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results. The developer should catch and handle all exceptions that can be anticipated.

Title:
HACKEREARTH dexters-payback-2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input handling**. The input format is not well-defined. For example, it is not clear how to handle negative numbers or non-integers. The developer should check the input for validity and handle errors appropriately.
2. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not find the optimal solution or may not terminate in a reasonable amount of time. The developer should carefully design and implement the algorithm to ensure that it is correct and efficient.
3. **Incorrect output formatting**. The output format is not well-defined. For example, it is not clear how to handle floating-point numbers or newline characters. The developer should carefully format the output to match the expected output format.
4. **Insufficient testing**. The developer may not have tested the program thoroughly enough. This can lead to bugs that are not caught until the program is deployed in production. The developer should test the program with a variety of input data and ensure that it produces the correct output.
5. **Failure to handle edge cases**. The developer may not have handled all of the edge cases for the problem. For example, the program may not work correctly if the input data is invalid or if the input data is too large. The developer should carefully consider all of the possible edge cases and ensure that the program handles them correctly.

Title:
HACKEREARTH gcd-9

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the GCD algorithm.** The GCD algorithm is a recursive function that takes two integers as input and returns their greatest common divisor. A common mistake is to implement the algorithm incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect use of the GCD algorithm.** The GCD algorithm is used to find the greatest common divisor of two integers. However, it is important to remember that the GCD of a set of integers is not necessarily the same as the GCD of any two of the integers in the set. For example, the GCD of the set {10, 15, 20} is 5, but the GCD of any two of the integers in the set is 1.
3. **Using an incorrect data structure to store the subarrays.** The subarrays that are being considered must be stored in a data structure that allows for efficient access and modification. A common mistake is to use a list to store the subarrays, which can lead to poor performance. A better option would be to use a hash table or a set.
4. **Not handling edge cases correctly.** There are a number of edge cases that need to be handled when solving this problem. For example, what happens if the input array is empty? What happens if the value of K is 0? What happens if there is no subarray whose GCD is at least K?
5. **Not using efficient algorithms.** There are a number of efficient algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. A common mistake is to use a brute-force algorithm, which can be very slow. A better option would be to use a dynamic programming algorithm or a divide-and-conquer algorithm.

Title:
HACKEREARTH large-small-sum

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect sorting algorithm**. The developer may use an incorrect sorting algorithm, such as bubble sort or selection sort, which can be very inefficient for large arrays.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may accidentally index the array incorrectly, resulting in the wrong answer.
3. **Incorrect use of pointers**. The developer may incorrectly use pointers to access the elements of the array, resulting in a segmentation fault or other errors.
4. **Memory leak**. The developer may not free the memory allocated for the array, resulting in a memory leak.
5. **Infinite loop**. The developer may write an infinite loop, which will cause the program to run forever.
6. **Incorrect output format**. The developer may not format the output correctly, resulting in an incorrect answer.
7. **Wrong answer**. The developer may make a mistake in their calculations, resulting in an incorrect answer.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully review their code and test it thoroughly before submitting it.

Title:
HACKEREARTH monk-and-some-queries

Pain points:
**1. Using an array to store the numbers**

The most common mistake is to use an array to store the numbers. This can lead to problems if the array is not large enough to store all of the numbers, or if the numbers are not unique.

**2. Not handling duplicate numbers correctly**

Another common mistake is not handling duplicate numbers correctly. For example, if a number is added to the array twice, it should only be counted once when finding the maximum or minimum value.

**3. Not handling empty arrays correctly**

It is also important to handle empty arrays correctly. For example, if a query is made to find the maximum or minimum value of an empty array, the correct answer is -1.

**4. Not using the correct data structures**

Finally, it is important to use the correct data structures to solve this problem. For example, a linked list would be a better choice than an array if the numbers are not guaranteed to be unique.

**5. Not using the correct algorithms**

Finally, it is important to use the correct algorithms to solve this problem. For example, a binary search would be a better choice than a linear search if the numbers are sorted.

2. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator should be used to ensure that the output is a positive integer.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of possible wall configurations.** The number of possible wall configurations should be calculated by multiplying the number of ways to place each brick by the number of ways to place the remaining bricks.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The code should handle the case where the number of bricks is zero or the maximum height of the wall is zero.

HACKEREARTH strings-1

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correctly specified. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by a single space. This can lead to errors in the program's output.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the number of strings**

The number of strings that Anton and Artur must write can be calculated incorrectly. For example, if the input is `1 3`, the program may incorrectly calculate the number of strings as `3` instead of `1`. This can lead to the program incorrectly outputing `NO` when the correct answer is `YES`.

**3. Incorrect comparison of the number of strings**

The program may incorrectly compare the number of strings that Anton and Artur must write. For example, if the input is `1 3`, the program may incorrectly compare the number of strings as `1 == 3` instead of `1 < 3`. This can lead to the program incorrectly outputing `YES` when the correct answer is `NO`.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The program's output may not be in the correct format. For example, the program may output `yes` instead of `YES`. This can lead to the program being marked incorrect, even if the logic is correct.

**5. Other errors**

There are a number of other errors that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include errors in the use of variables, errors in the use of functions, and errors in the logic of the program.

ATCODER p02600 M-SOLUTIONS Programming Contest 2020 - Kyu in AtCoder

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for `X`**

The input `X` is an integer, so it should be stored in an integer variable. If you accidentally use a floating-point variable, you may get incorrect results.

**2. Using the wrong comparison operator**

The problem states that `X` is an integer from 400 to 1999. This means that `X` must be less than or equal to 1999. If you accidentally use the greater-than operator (`>`), you will get an incorrect result.

**3. Using the wrong kyu range**

The problem states that the kyus are given for ratings from 400 through 1999. This means that you need to use the correct kyu range for your input value. If you use the wrong range, you will get an incorrect result.

**4. Not handling invalid input**

The problem states that `X` must be an integer from 400 to 1999. If the input value does not meet these criteria, you should handle it appropriately. For example, you could print an error message or exit the program.

**5. Not using a consistent coding style**

Your code should be easy to read and understand. This means using a consistent coding style, commenting your code, and following the general rules of good programming practice.
Test inputs:
**1. Using the wrong data type for `X`**

```
X = input()
# This will store `X` as a string, which is not what we want.

kyu = int(X)
# This will store `X` as an integer, which is what we want.
```

**2. Using the wrong comparison operator**

```
if X > 1999:
    # This will give an error because `X` is an integer and cannot be greater than 1999.

kyu = 8
```

**3. Using the wrong kyu range**

```
if X <= 599:
    kyu = 8
elif X <= 799:
    kyu = 7
elif X <= 999:
    kyu = 6
elif X <= 1199:

elif X <= 1599:
    kyu = 3
elif X <= 1799:
    kyu = 2
elif X <= 1999:
    kyu = 1
```

**4. Not handling invalid input**

```

The developer may accidentally use the wrong formula, or they may make a mistake in their calculations. This would cause the program to produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect rounding**. The output should be rounded to 10^{-6}. The developer may accidentally round to the wrong number of decimal places, or they may not round at all. This would cause the output to be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect error handling**. The program should handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input is not a positive integer, the program should print an error message and exit. The developer may accidentally ignore errors, or they may not handle them correctly. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
5. **Other bugs**. There are many other possible bugs that a developer could encounter when solving this problem. For example, the developer may accidentally use the wrong variable names, or they may make a mistake in their logic. These bugs could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**1. The input format is not clear**

The input format is not clear. It is not clear how many integers are in each line. For example, in the first example, it is not clear if the input is "4 1\n2 3 4 1" or "4 1\n2 3 4 1\n".

**2. The output format is not clear**

The output format is not clear. It is not clear if the output should be an integer or a string.

**3. The problem is not well-defined**

The problem is not well-defined. It is not clear what the goal of the problem is. For example, in the first example, it is not clear if the goal is to minimize the number of operations or to maximize the number of operations.

**4. The problem is too easy**

The problem is too easy. It can be solved in a few lines of code.

**5. The problem is too hard**

The problem is too hard. It cannot be solved in a reasonable amount of time.

Title:
ATCODER p02999 AtCoder Beginner Contest 130 - Rounding

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect comparison:** The developer may compare `X` and `A` using the `==` operator, which will return `True` if `X` is equal to `A`. However, the problem statement requires that the output be `0` if `X` is less than `A` and `10` if `X` is not less than `A`.
2. **Incorrect typecasting:** The developer may try to typecast `X` and `A` to strings and compare them using the `>` operator. However, this will not work because strings are compared lexicographically, not numerically.
3. **Incorrect logic:** The developer may incorrectly assume that the output should be `0` if `X` is less than or equal to `A`. However, the problem statement requires that the output be `0` if `X` is less than `A` and `10` if `X` is not less than `A`.
4. **Off-by-one error:** The developer may forget to add one to `X` when checking if it is less than `A`. This will result in the output being incorrect if `X` is equal to `A`.
5. **Incorrect indentation:** The developer may forget to indent the code inside the `if` statement. This will cause the code to be executed incorrectly.

Title:
ATCODER p03140 NIKKEI Programming Contest 2019 - Touitsu

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of comparison operators.** When comparing strings, it is important to use the `==` operator, not the `==` operator. The `==` operator compares the two operands as objects, and will not return a true value if the strings contain the same characters but in a different order. The `==` operator, on the other hand, compares the two strings lexicographically, and will return a true value if the strings contain the same characters in the same order.
2. **Incorrect use of the `min()` function.** The `min()` function returns the smallest element in a given iterable. When using the `min()` function with strings, it is important to remember that the strings are first converted to numbers before being compared. This means that the `min()` function will return the string with the smallest numerical value, not the string with the smallest number of characters.
3. **Incorrect use of the `ord()` function.** The `ord()` function returns the ASCII code value of a given character. When using the `ord()` function with strings, it is important to remember that the strings are first converted to bytes before being converted to ASCII code values. This means that the `ord()` function will return the ASCII code value of the first byte in the string, not the ASCII code value of the entire string.
4. **Incorrect use of the `chr()` function.** The `chr()` function returns the character with the given ASCII code value. When using the `chr()` function with numbers, it is important to remember that the numbers are first converted to strings before being converted to ASCII code values. This means that the `chr()` function will return the character with the ASCII code value of the first character in the string, not the ASCII code value of the entire string.
5. **Incorrect use of the `range()` function.** The `range()` function returns a sequence of numbers from a given start value to a given end value. When using the `range()` function with strings, it is important to remember that the strings are first converted to numbers before being used in the `range()` function. This means that the `range()` function will return a sequence of numbers from the ASCII code value of the first character in the string to the ASCII code value of the last character in the string.

Title:
ATCODER p03598 AtCoder Beginner Contest 074 - Collecting Balls (Easy Version)

Pain points:
**1. Wrong variable type**

The input is given in the format of `N, K, x_1, x_2, ..., x_N`. However, the code below tries to convert `N` to a string. This will cause a `TypeError`.

```
N = int(input())
K = int(input())
x = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

**2. Index out of bound**

The code below tries to access the element at index `N` in the list `x`. However, the list only has `N` elements, so this will cause an `IndexError`.

```
for i in range(N + 1):
    if x[i] == min(x):
        print(2 * K)
```

**3. Incorrect calculation**

The code below calculates the distance between two points by subtracting the x-coordinates. However, this is incorrect because the y-coordinates are also important.

```
distance = abs(x[i] - x[i - 1])
```

**4. Using the wrong variable**

The code below uses the variable `i` to index the list `x`. However, `i` is also used to iterate over the list, so this will cause a `NameError`.

```
for i in range(N):
    distance += abs(x[i] - x[i - 1])
```

**5. Not handling the case where there is no ball**

The code below assumes that there is always a ball at each point. However, this is not always the case. If there is no ball at a particular point, the code will throw an `IndexError`.

```
for i in range(N):
    if x[i] == min(x):
        print(2 * K)

Title:
ATCODER p03759 AtCoder Beginner Contest 058 - ι⊥l

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` should be separated by a single space. However, if the input contains more than one space between the integers, or if the integers are not separated by a space at all, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce an incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator**. The problem statement specifies that the arrangement of the poles is beautiful if `b-a = c-b`. However, if the program uses the incorrect comparison operator `==` instead of `!=`, it will incorrectly conclude that the arrangement of the poles is beautiful even if it is not.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The problem statement specifies that the output should be either `YES` or `NO`. However, if the program outputs anything other than these two strings, the judge will not be able to correctly evaluate the solution and will give the program a negative score.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The problem statement specifies that the three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` should be between 1 and 100, inclusive. However, if the program incorrectly checks for values less than or equal to 100, it may incorrectly accept inputs that are less than 1 or greater than 100.
5. **Arithmetic error**. The problem statement specifies that the arrangement of the poles is beautiful if `b-a = c-b`. However, if the program incorrectly calculates the difference between two integers, it may incorrectly conclude that the arrangement of the poles is beautiful even if it is not.
6. **Logic error**. The problem statement specifies that the arrangement of the poles is beautiful if `b-a = c-b`. However, if the program incorrectly implements this logic, it may incorrectly conclude that the arrangement of the poles is beautiful even if it is not.

By avoiding these common problems and bugs, you can increase the chances of your program correctly solving the problem.

Title:
ATCODER p03921 CODE FESTIVAL 2016 Final (Parallel) - Interpretation

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is as follows:

```
N M
K_1 L_{1,1} L_{1,2} ... L_{1,{}K_1}
K_2 L_{2,1} L_{2,2} ... L_{2,{}K_2}
:
K_N L_{N,1} L_{N,2} ... L_{N,{}K_N}
```

If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is as follows:

```
YES
```

or

```
NO
```

If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly output the answer and will likely receive a compilation error.

**3. Incorrect data type**

The data types of the input and output must be correct. For example, the input N and M must be integers, and the input K_i and L_{i,j} must be integers. If the data types are incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly process the data and will likely crash.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a programmer accidentally misses or adds one to an index. For example, if a programmer is iterating over a list of numbers, they might accidentally start at index 0 instead of index 1, or they might accidentally end at index N instead of index N-1. Off-by-one errors can cause the program to produce incorrect results.

**5. Logic errors**

Logic errors occur when a programmer makes a mistake in their logic. For example, a programmer might incorrectly assume that two variables are equal when they are not, or they might incorrectly calculate the value of a function. Logic errors can cause the program to produce incorrect results or to crash.

**6. Runtime errors**

Runtime errors occur when a program encounters a problem while it is running. For example, a program might run out of memory, or it might try to access a memory address that does not exist. Runtime errors can cause the program to crash.

Title:
AIZU p00022 Maximum Sum Sequence

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly using a brute-force approach.** The brute-force approach to this problem is to simply iterate over all possible subsequences of the input numbers and find the one with the maximum sum. This approach is **exponentially inefficient**, as the number of subsequences grows exponentially with the length of the input.
2. **Using a sub-optimal dynamic programming solution.** A dynamic programming solution to this problem can be much more efficient than a brute-force approach. However, it is important to use a sub-optimal dynamic programming solution, as an optimal dynamic programming solution would also be exponentially inefficient.
3. **Not handling the corner cases correctly.** The input to this problem may contain negative numbers, and the output should be the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence of the input numbers. It is important to handle these corner cases correctly, as a mistake here could lead to an incorrect answer.
4. **Not using appropriate data structures.** The input to this problem may be very large, and it is important to use appropriate data structures to store the input numbers and to perform the necessary computations. Using inefficient data structures could lead to a significant slowdown in the execution time of the program.
5. **Not using appropriate algorithms.** The algorithms used to solve this problem should be as efficient as possible. Using inefficient algorithms could lead to a significant slowdown in the execution time of the program.

AIZU p00310 The Number of Participants

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is specified as "p m c", but the developer may accidentally use a different format, such as "p,m,c" or "p,m,c\n". This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the total number of participants**. The total number of participants is calculated by adding the number of participants in each department. However, the developer may accidentally add the numbers incorrectly, or they may forget to add one of the numbers. This would also cause the program to produce incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When the developer is iterating through the input, they may accidentally increment the index by one too many times or one too few times. This would cause the program to skip over one or more of the input values, or it would read the same value twice. This would also cause the program to produce incorrect output.
4. **Memory errors**. If the developer does not allocate enough memory for the input values, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
5. **Syntax errors**. The developer may make a mistake in the syntax of the program, such as using the wrong variable name or forgetting to close a bracket. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
6. **Logic errors**. The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program, such as using the wrong formula to calculate the total number of participants. This would also cause the program to produce incorrect output.

Title:
AIZU p00474 Icicles

Pain points:
**1. Incorrectly comparing the lengths of two icicles**

In the problem statement, it is stated that "The i-th icicles grow by 1 cm per hour only if they are longer than both the i − 1st icicles and the i + 1st icicles". However, some implementations may incorrectly compare the lengths of two icicles by using the following code:

```
if (a[i] > a[i - 1] && a[i] > a[i + 1]) {
  // The i-th icicle grows by 1 cm per hour
}
```

This code is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the i-th icicle may be adjacent to only one end of the icicles. For example, if the i-th icicle is the first icicle, then the condition `a[i] > a[i - 1]` will always be false, even if the i-th icicle is longer than the second icicle.

To correctly compare the lengths of two icicles, we need to use the following code:

```
if (i == 0 && a[i] > a[i + 1]) {
  // The i-th icicle grows by 1 cm per hour
} else if (i == N - 1 && a[i] > a[i - 1]) {
  // The i-th icicle grows by 1 cm per hour
} else if (a[i] > a[i - 1] && a[i] > a[i + 1]) {
  // The i-th icicle grows by 1 cm per hour
}
```

**2. Not considering the case where all icicles are initially the same length**

The problem statement states that "In the first stage, the lengths of the two adjacent icicles are all different". However, some implementations may incorrectly assume that all icicles are initially the same length. This can lead to incorrect results, as the time it takes for all the icicles to break will be different if they are initially the same length.

To correctly handle the case where all icicles are initially the same length, we need to use the following code:

```
if (a[0] == a[1] && a[0] == a[N - 1]) {
  // All icicles are initially the same length
  // The time it takes for all the icicles to break is L
  return L;
}
```

**3. Not handling the case where an icicle breaks before it has a chance to grow**

The problem statement states that "All icicles break from the root the moment they reach L cm". However, some implementations may incorrectly assume that an icicle will always have a chance to grow before it breaks. This can lead to incorrect results, as the time it takes for all the icicles to break will be different if an icicle breaks before it has a chance to grow.

To correctly handle the case where an icicle breaks before it has a chance to grow, we need to use the following code:

```
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
  if (a[i] >= L) {
    // The i-th icicle has already broken
    continue;
  }

  // The i-th icicle has not yet broken
  // Grow the i-th icicle by 1 cm
  a[i]++;
}
```

**4. Not handling the case where the input is invalid**

The problem statement states that "On the first line of the input, the integer N, which represents the number of icicles, and the integer L, which represents the limit length of the icicles, are written in this order, separated by blanks". However, some implementations may incorrectly assume that the input will always be valid. This can lead to incorrect results, as the program will crash if the input is invalid.

To correctly handle the case where the input is invalid, we need to use the following code:

```
try {
  // Read the number of icicles and the limit length of the icicles
  int N = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine());
  int L = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine());

  // Check if the input is valid
  if (N < 2 || N > 100000 || L < 2 || L > 50000) {

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is specified in the problem statement. If the input format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect calculation of nim-sum**

The nim-sum is a key concept in this problem. If the nim-sum is not calculated correctly, the program may produce incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect implementation of the game-tree search**

The game-tree search is a powerful technique for solving Nim-type games. If the game-tree search is implemented incorrectly, the program may produce incorrect output.

**4. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

The problem statement specifies some edge cases, such as when the number of players is 1 or when the initial number of stones is 0. If these edge cases are not handled correctly, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

**5. Incorrect handling of errors**

The program should handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input file cannot be opened, the program should print an error message and exit.

Title:
AIZU p00940 Deadlock Detection

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly identifying deadlocks.** A deadlock occurs when two or more processes are each waiting for a resource that is held by the other process. If a developer incorrectly identifies a deadlock, it could lead to the system incorrectly terminating a process or processes that are not actually deadlocked.
2. **Not identifying all deadlocks.** A deadlock can occur even if there are no explicit circular dependencies between processes. For example, a deadlock can occur if two processes are each waiting for a resource that is held by a third process. If a developer does not identify all deadlocks, it could lead to the system continuing to run in a deadlocked state, which could eventually lead to a system crash.
3. **Incorrectly handling deadlocks.** If a deadlock occurs, the system must take some action to resolve the deadlock. The most common approach is to forcibly terminate one or more of the deadlocked processes. However, this approach can lead to data loss or other problems. A developer must carefully consider the best way to handle deadlocks in order to minimize the risk of these problems.
4. **Performance problems.** Detecting deadlocks can be a computationally expensive operation. If a developer is not careful, deadlock detection can significantly slow down the system. It is important to balance the need to detect deadlocks with the need to maintain system performance.
5. **Incorrectly handling multiple deadlocks.** It is possible for multiple deadlocks to occur at the same time. If a developer does not handle multiple deadlocks correctly, it could lead to the system incorrectly terminating processes or processes continuing to run in a deadlocked state. A developer must carefully consider the best way to handle multiple deadlocks in order to minimize the risk of these problems.

Title:
AIZU p01073 Potatoes

Pain points:
**1. Incorrectly counting the number of potatoes harvested.**

The problem states that "When potatoes are planted in field i, ai potatoes can be harvested for each potato planted in field i one year later." However, some developers may incorrectly count the number of potatoes harvested by multiplying the number of potatoes planted by the yield of the field. For example, if a field has a yield of 2 and you plant 1 potato, you will harvest 2 potatoes, not 3.

**2. Not considering the maximum number of potatoes that can be planted in a field.**

The problem states that "However, only bi potatoes can be planted in the field i at the maximum." Some developers may forget to check this constraint and plant more potatoes than allowed. For example, if a field has a planting limit of 5 and you try to plant 6 potatoes, the program will crash.

**3. Using an incorrect data type to store the number of potatoes.**

The number of potatoes can be very large, so it is important to use an appropriate data type to store it. Some developers may use a data type that is too small, which will cause the program to overflow. For example, if you use a 32-bit integer to store the number of potatoes, you will only be able to store up to 2^31 - 1 potatoes, which is not enough for this problem.

**4. Not handling the edge cases correctly.**

The problem has a few edge cases that developers should be aware of. For example, what happens if the number of potatoes is 0? What happens if the number of fields is 0? What happens if the yield of a field is 0? Developers should make sure to handle these edge cases correctly.

**5. Using inefficient algorithms.**

The problem can be solved in O(N) time, but some developers may use an inefficient algorithm that takes O(N^2) time or more. This can lead to a significant slowdown in the program.

Title:
AIZU p01681 Putter

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always strictly followed, and the developer may not handle all possible cases correctly. For example, the input may contain invalid characters, or the numbers may not be in the correct format.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not always strictly followed, and the developer may not handle all possible cases correctly. For example, the output may contain extra spaces or newlines, or the numbers may not be in the correct format.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may not correctly calculate the number of possible orders of the walls, or the developer may not correctly check if the ball hits the corner of the field.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer may not correctly free up memory that is no longer needed, which could lead to a memory leak. This could eventually cause the program to crash or run out of memory.
5. **Race conditions**. The developer may not correctly synchronize access to shared resources, which could lead to a race condition. This could cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
6. **Deadlocks**. The developer may not correctly handle deadlocks, which could cause the program to hang or crash.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer may not correctly implement security features, which could allow attackers to exploit the program. For example, the developer may not correctly sanitize user input, which could allow attackers to inject malicious code into the program.
8. **Bugs in third-party libraries**. The developer may use third-party libraries that contain bugs. These bugs could cause the developer's program to malfunction.

Title:
AIZU p01825 Laser Cutter

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not very clear. It is possible that a developer may misinterpret the input format and make mistakes when parsing the input.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the total length of the laser cutter path**. The total length of the laser cutter path is calculated by summing the lengths of all the individual line segments. It is possible that a developer may make mistakes when calculating the length of each line segment or when summing the lengths of all the line segments.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of cuts**. The minimum number of cuts is calculated by finding the maximum number of line segments that can be cut simultaneously. It is possible that a developer may make mistakes when finding the maximum number of line segments that can be cut simultaneously.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem is to print the minimum number of cuts. It is possible that a developer may print the wrong output format.

Title:
AIZU p01960 Tree Separator

Pain points:
### Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The tree traversal algorithm should visit each vertex of the tree exactly once, and it should not visit any vertex more than once.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm for finding the maximum number of connected components with $K$ or more vertices.** This is another common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The algorithm should find all of the connected components of the tree that have $K$ or more vertices, and it should return the maximum number of such components.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The input to this problem may contain edge cases that the developer must be aware of. For example, the input may contain a tree with no edges, or it may contain a tree with only one vertex. The developer must be able to handle these edge cases correctly in order to get the correct answer.
4. **Incorrect use of memory.** The developer must be careful not to use too much memory when solving this problem. The input to this problem may be very large, so the developer must be careful not to allocate more memory than is necessary.
5. **Incorrect implementation of the time complexity of the algorithm.** The developer must be able to prove that the algorithm runs in polynomial time. This is a difficult task, but it is important to be able to do it in order to ensure that the algorithm is correct.

### How to avoid these problems

1. **To avoid incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm, the developer should carefully read the problem statement and understand the algorithm. The developer should then implement the algorithm in a clear and concise way.**
2. **To avoid incorrect implementation of the algorithm for finding the maximum number of connected components with $K$ or more vertices, the developer should carefully read the problem statement and understand the algorithm. The developer should then implement the algorithm in a clear and concise way.**
3. **To avoid incorrect handling of edge cases, the developer should carefully read the problem statement and identify all of the possible edge cases. The developer should then implement the algorithm in a way that handles all of these edge cases correctly.**
4. **To avoid incorrect use of memory, the developer should carefully track the amount of memory that the algorithm is using. The developer should also be aware of the maximum amount of memory that is available on the system.**
5. **To avoid incorrect implementation of the time complexity of the algorithm, the developer should carefully read the problem statement and understand the time complexity of the algorithm. The developer should then implement the algorithm in a way that matches the specified time complexity.**

Title:
AIZU p02107 Demon's Plan

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Off-by-one errors.** The input format is a bit tricky, and it's easy to make a mistake when parsing the data. For example, you might accidentally count the number of familiars or demons one less than you should.
* **Incorrect sorting.** The problem statement requires you to minimize the maximum difference in the number of demons visited per familiar. To do this, you need to sort the demons by their distance from each familiar. However, it's easy to make a mistake when sorting the data, especially if you're not using a stable sorting algorithm.
* **Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm.** The greedy algorithm used to solve this problem is fairly simple, but it's easy to make a mistake when implementing it. For example, you might accidentally assign a demon to a familiar that is farther away from it than another familiar.
* **Incorrect calculation of the maximum distance.** The maximum distance is the maximum distance between a demon and the familiar that is assigned to it. It's easy to make a mistake when calculating this distance, especially if you're not careful about rounding.

**Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:**

* **Be careful when parsing the input data.** Make sure you understand the format of the input data and that you're parsing it correctly.
* **Use a stable sorting algorithm.** This will help you avoid errors when sorting the demons by their distance from each familiar.
* **Test your code thoroughly.** Make sure you test your code with a variety of input data to make sure that it's working correctly.
* **Be careful when calculating the maximum distance.** Make sure you're rounding your calculations correctly.
