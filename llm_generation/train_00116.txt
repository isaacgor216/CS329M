CODECHEF cdva1606

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not specified.** The input format is not specified in the problem statement. This could lead to confusion for developers who are not familiar with the CODECHEF format.
2. **The output format is not specified.** The output format is not specified in the problem statement. This could lead to confusion for developers who are not familiar with the CODECHEF format.
3. **The problem is not well-defined.** The problem is not well-defined. For example, it is not clear what happens if the enemy clan has fewer than k troops.
4. **The problem is too easy.** The problem is too easy. A simple brute-force solution would be sufficient to solve the problem.
5. **The problem is too hard.** The problem is too hard. A sophisticated solution would be required to solve the problem.

Here are some specific bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

1. **The developer might incorrectly parse the input.** The developer might incorrectly parse the input, leading to incorrect results.
2. **The developer might incorrectly implement the solution.** The developer might incorrectly implement the solution, leading to incorrect results.
3. **The developer might not handle all possible cases.** The developer might not handle all possible cases, leading to incorrect results.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that they understand the problem before starting to code. They should also test their code thoroughly to make sure that it produces the correct results.

Title:
CODECHEF dce05

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator**. The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 5 % 2 is 1 because 5 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. However, some developers mistakenly use the modulo operator to check if a number is even. For example, the following code would incorrectly check if a number is even:

```
if (number % 2 == 0) {
  // The number is even
} else {
  // The number is odd
}
```

The correct way to check if a number is even is to use the following code:

```
if (number % 2 == 0) {
  // The number is even
} else {
  // The number is odd
}
```

2. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when a developer accidentally counts one more or one less than they intended. For example, the following code would incorrectly count the number of elements in an array:

```
int count = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
  count++;
}
```

The correct way to count the number of elements in an array is to use the following code:

```
int count = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
  count++;
}
```

3. **Using the wrong data type**. Developers often use the wrong data type for a variable, which can lead to errors. For example, the following code would incorrectly calculate the average of a list of numbers:

```
double average = 0;
for (int number in numbers) {
  average += number;
}
average /= numbers.length;
```

The correct way to calculate the average of a list of numbers is to use the following code:

```
double average = 0;
for (double number in numbers) {
  average += number;
}
average /= numbers.length;
```

4. **Not handling edge cases**. Developers often forget to handle edge cases, which can lead to errors. For example, the following code would incorrectly divide a number by zero:

```
int result = number / 0;
```

The correct way to divide a number by zero is to use the following code:

```
if (number == 0) {
  throw new ArithmeticException("Division by zero");
}
int result = number / 0;
```

Title:
CODECHEF mvcoin

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain a number that is too large or too small. The developer should check the input format and handle incorrect input gracefully.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correct. For example, the output may contain a number that is too large or too small. The developer should check the output format and handle incorrect output gracefully.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm. For example, the algorithm may not find the optimal solution or it may take too long to run. The developer should carefully design the algorithm and test it thoroughly.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer may not free up memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash. The developer should use a memory management tool to track memory usage and identify memory leaks.
5. **Synchronization issues**. The developer may not synchronize access to shared resources. This can lead to race conditions, which can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash. The developer should use locks or other synchronization mechanisms to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer may not implement security measures correctly. This can allow attackers to exploit the program and gain unauthorized access to the system. The developer should carefully design the program's security features and implement them correctly.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always followed correctly. For example, the input may contain spaces between the numbers, or it may contain extra characters. The developer should check the input format and handle any errors appropriately.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the final array sum**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the sum of the final array. This can happen if the developer does not correctly account for the addition of K to each element of the array.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of different final arrays**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the number of different final arrays. This can happen if the developer does not correctly account for the fact that some arrays may be identical after the addition of K to each element.
4. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic**. The developer may incorrectly use modulo arithmetic when calculating the number of different final arrays. This can happen if the developer does not correctly understand the rules of modulo arithmetic.
5. **Incorrect use of the 10^9+7 modulus**. The developer may incorrectly use the 10^9+7 modulus when calculating the number of different final arrays. This can happen if the developer does not correctly understand the properties of the 10^9+7 modulus.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully follow the input format, correctly calculate the final array sum, correctly calculate the number of different final arrays, correctly use modulo arithmetic, and correctly use the 10^9+7 modulus.

Title:
CODECHEF witmath

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 5 % 3 = 2. This means that 5 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2.
2. **Incorrect use of the division operator.** The division operator (/) returns the quotient of a division operation. For example, 5 / 3 = 1.6666666666666667. This means that 5 divided by 3 is approximately 1.6666666666666667.
3. **Incorrect use of the exponentiation operator.** The exponentiation operator (**) raises a number to a power. For example, 2 ** 3 = 8. This means that 2 raised to the power of 3 is 8.
4. **Incorrect use of the factorial operator.** The factorial operator (!) multiplies a number by all of the numbers below it. For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. This means that the factorial of 5 is 120.
5. **Incorrect use of the Euler's totient function.** The Euler's totient function (φ(n)) counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are coprime to n. For example, φ(6) = 2 because the only positive integers less than or equal to 6 that are coprime to 6 are 1 and 5.

To avoid these problems, be sure to understand the mathematical concepts behind the code you are writing. Also, be sure to use the correct operators and operands. Finally, be sure to test your code thoroughly before submitting it.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1020_B. Badge

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specified in the problem statement is `n p_1, ..., p_n`. However, if the input format is incorrect, such as `n p_1, ..., p_n, q`, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect use of pointers.** In C++, pointers are used to store the addresses of variables. If the pointers are not used correctly, the program may crash or produce incorrect output. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```c++
int *p = new int;
*p = 10;
```

The correct code is:

```c++
int *p = new int;
*p = 10;
```

3. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors occur when the programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. For example, the following code will print the wrong output:

```c++
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << i << endl;
}
```

The correct code is:

```c++
for (int i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {
    cout << i << endl;
}
```

4. **Memory leaks.** Memory leaks occur when the programmer forgets to free the memory that has been allocated. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing. For example, the following code will cause a memory leak:

```c++
int *p = new int;
*p = 10;
```

The correct code is:

```c++
int *p = new int;
*p = 10;
delete p;
```

5. **Undefined behavior.** Undefined behavior occurs when the compiler is not able to determine the outcome of a program. This can happen when the programmer uses a feature of the language in an incorrect way. For example, the following code will cause undefined behavior:

```c++
int a = 10;
int b = a / 0;
```

The correct code is:

```c++
int a = 10;
int b = a / 2;
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 1066_C. Books Queries

Pain points:
 **Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the logic.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving problems. It is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the exact requirements. Once you understand the problem, you can start implementing the solution. It is important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct.
2. **Using incorrect data types.** Another common mistake is using incorrect data types. For example, if you are asked to find the minimum of two numbers, you should not use the `string` data type. Instead, you should use the `int` data type.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that occurs when you forget to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Using global variables.** Global variables are a dangerous practice because they can make your code difficult to debug. It is better to use local variables whenever possible.
5. **Not using a unit test framework.** Unit tests are an essential part of any software development project. They help you to catch bugs early and prevent them from causing problems in production.

**Additional Tips:**

* **Use the debugger.** The debugger is a powerful tool that can help you to find bugs in your code. It allows you to step through your code line by line and see how it is executed.
* **Ask for help.** If you are stuck on a problem, don't be afraid to ask for help. There are many online resources available, such as forums and Stack Overflow.
* **Keep learning.** The best way to become a better developer is to keep learning. There are many resources available, such as books, articles, and online courses.

CODEFORCES 1178_B. WOW Factor

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of "w"s in the input string.** The problem states that "Bob would type it as "vvvv", but this string actually contains three occurrences of "w"". However, some developers may mistakenly count the number of "v"s in the input string and divide it by 2 to get the number of "w"s. This will lead to an incorrect answer.
2. **Not considering the case where the input string does not contain any "w"s.** The problem states that "it is not guaranteed that it is possible to get s from another string replacing "w" with "vv"". This means that the input string may not contain any "w"s. Some developers may incorrectly assume that the input string must contain at least one "w". This will lead to an incorrect answer.
3. **Not handling the case where the input string is empty.** The problem states that "The input contains a single non-empty string s". This means that the input string cannot be empty. Some developers may incorrectly assume that the input string can be empty. This will lead to an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrectly handling the case where the input string contains multiple consecutive "v"s.** The problem states that "the "v"s have to be consecutive". This means that the input string cannot contain multiple consecutive "v"s. Some developers may incorrectly assume that the input string can contain multiple consecutive "v"s. This will lead to an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrectly handling the case where the input string contains multiple consecutive "o"s.** The problem states that "the "v"s have to be consecutive". This means that the input string cannot contain multiple consecutive "o"s. Some developers may incorrectly assume that the input string can contain multiple consecutive "o"s. This will lead to an incorrect answer.

CODEFORCES 1213_D1. Equalizing by Division (easy version)

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input contains two integers n and k, which are the number of elements in the array and the number of equal numbers required. The data type of n and k should be `int`. If you use `float` or `double`, you will get a wrong answer.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The problem is to find the minimum possible number of operations required to obtain at least k equal numbers in the array. A naive algorithm is to divide each element of the array by 2 until there are at least k equal numbers. This algorithm will work, but it is not efficient. A better algorithm is to sort the array and then divide each element by 2 until the difference between the largest and smallest element is less than or equal to k. This algorithm is more efficient because it does not require dividing all elements of the array by 2.

**3. Not handling corner cases**

The problem statement mentions that it is possible to have a_i = 0 after some operations. This means that you need to handle the case where the largest element of the array is 0. If the largest element of the array is 0, then you cannot divide any element of the array by 2. In this case, the answer is 0.

**4. Using incorrect code**

The following code is incorrect:

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(n):
    a[i] = a[i] // 2

print(a)
```

This code will not work because it does not divide each element of the array by 2. The correct code is as follows:

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(n):
    a[i] = a[i] // 2

Title:
CODEFORCES 1236_E. Alice and the Unfair Game

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is two integers n and m, separated by a space. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash. For example, if the input is "3 3 2 2 2", the program will crash because there are three integers in the input, but the format requires only two.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is a single integer, which is the number of scenarios that Marisa can win. If the output format is incorrect, the program will crash. For example, if the output is "3 2 2", the program will crash because the output is not a single integer.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When calculating the number of scenarios, it is important to make sure that you don't count any scenarios twice. For example, if the input is "3 3 2 2 2", the number of scenarios is 7, not 8. This is because the scenario (2, 2) is counted twice.

**4. Using the wrong data type**

When calculating the number of scenarios, it is important to use the correct data type. For example, if the input is "1000000000 1000000000", the number of scenarios is 2147483647, not 4294967295. This is because the data type int can only store numbers up to 2147483647.

**5. Not handling corner cases**

When writing a program, it is important to handle corner cases. For example, if the input is "0 0", the number of scenarios is 0. This is because there are no boxes to put the doll in.

CODEFORCES 1278_C. Berry Jam

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect variable type**. The variable type must be declared correctly, otherwise the program will not work as expected. For example, if a variable is declared as an integer but is assigned a string value, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be correct, otherwise the program will not produce the correct output. For example, if the program is supposed to find the minimum value in a list, but it instead finds the maximum value, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the program misses or adds one element to a calculation. For example, if the program is supposed to find the sum of the first 100 numbers, but it instead sums the first 99 numbers, the output will be incorrect.
5. **Index errors**. Index errors occur when the program accesses an element of an array or list that does not exist. For example, if the program is supposed to print the first element of an array, but the array is empty, the program will crash.
6. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when the program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
7. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more parts of the program try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results or crashing.
8. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more parts of the program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish because it is waiting for the other. This can lead to the program running indefinitely or crashing.
9. **Unhandled exceptions**. Unhandled exceptions occur when the program encounters an error that it cannot handle. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
10. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities occur when the program is not secure and can be exploited by attackers. This can lead to the program being hacked or its data being stolen.

CODEFORCES 1297_I. Falling Blocks

Pain points:
 * The final answer is 4.  **Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The most common mistake is to incorrectly implement the algorithm for finding the blocks that are covered by a given block. This can lead to incorrect results, such as blocks being vaporized when they should not be, or blocks not being vaporized when they should be.
2. **Incorrect handling of boundary conditions.** The problem statement specifies that the blocks are dropped downwards from very high up. This means that the blocks must be initialized with their y-coordinates set to a very large value. If this is not done, the algorithm may incorrectly vaporize blocks that are not actually in contact with the flat surface.
3. **Incorrect handling of floating-point numbers.** The problem statement specifies that the coordinates of the blocks are integers. However, floating-point numbers are often used to represent coordinates in computer programs. This can lead to errors if the floating-point numbers are not rounded to the nearest integer before being used in the algorithm.
4. **Incorrect use of memory.** The algorithm for finding the blocks that are covered by a given block can be very memory-intensive. This is because it requires storing a list of all of the blocks that are currently in the game. If the number of blocks is large, this can lead to a memory overflow.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The algorithm for finding the blocks that are covered by a given block can throw an exception if the given block is not valid. This exception should be handled gracefully, such as by printing an error message and exiting the program.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1340_C. Nastya and Unexpected Guest

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not correctly followed. For example, the input may contain a non-integer value, or the number of elements in a list may not match the expected number. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as a logic error, a missing or incorrect condition, or an infinite loop. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect data type**

The data type of a variable may be incorrect. For example, a variable that should be an integer may be declared as a string. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**4. Incorrect variable name**

The name of a variable may be incorrect. For example, a variable that should be named "n" may be named "N". This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**5. Incorrect indentation**

The indentation of the code may be incorrect. This can make the code difficult to read and understand, and it can also lead to errors.

**6. Missing or incorrect comments**

The code should be well-commented to make it easier to understand. Missing or incorrect comments can make the code difficult to read and understand, and it can also lead to errors.

**7. Using global variables**

Global variables should be used sparingly. When a variable is declared as global, it can be accessed from any function in the program. This can make the program more difficult to debug and maintain.

**8. Using too much memory**

The program should be designed to use as little memory as possible. This can be done by avoiding unnecessary memory allocations and by freeing memory that is no longer needed.

**9. Using too much CPU time**

The program should be designed to run as efficiently as possible. This can be done by avoiding unnecessary computations and by using efficient algorithms.

**10. Using bad design patterns**

The program should be designed using good design patterns. This can make the program more readable, maintainable, and extensible.

CODEFORCES 1362_C. Johnny and Another Rating Drop

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is not very clear. It is not clear whether the input should be a single integer or a list of integers. If the input is a single integer, then the problem is trivial. If the input is a list of integers, then the problem is more challenging.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format for this problem is also not very clear. It is not clear whether the output should be a single integer or a list of integers. If the output is a single integer, then the problem is trivial. If the output is a list of integers, then the problem is more challenging.
3. **Incorrect calculation of unfairness**. The unfairness of the contest is defined as the sum of the differences between two consecutive ratings. However, it is not clear how to calculate the differences between two consecutive ratings. If the ratings are represented as binary numbers, then the differences can be calculated by counting the number of bits that are different between the two numbers. However, if the ratings are represented as decimal numbers, then the differences can be calculated by subtracting the smaller number from the larger number.
4. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**. The algorithm for calculating the unfairness of the contest is not very difficult. However, it is important to implement the algorithm correctly. If the algorithm is not implemented correctly, then the output will be incorrect.
5. **Incorrect testing of the algorithm**. It is important to test the algorithm thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. The algorithm should be tested on a variety of inputs to ensure that it works correctly in all cases.
6. **Incorrect debugging of the algorithm**. If the algorithm does not work correctly, then it is important to be able to debug the algorithm to find the source of the error. The debugger can be used to step through the code line by line to see where the error is occurring.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. Carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand the input and output formats.
2. Write a detailed algorithm for solving the problem.
3. Implement the algorithm in a programming language of your choice.
4. Test the algorithm on a variety of inputs to ensure that it works correctly.
5. Debug the algorithm if it does not work correctly.

CODEFORCES 1382_D. Unmerge

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a permutation of length 2n. The integers in the permutation are from 1 to 2n. So we need to use an integer array of length 2n to store the permutation. If we use a shorter array, it will cause an out-of-bound error.

**2. Not handling the case where the permutation is not a valid one**

The input data is a permutation. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. So we need to check if the input data is a valid permutation. If it is not a valid permutation, we should return "NO".

**3. Not handling the case where there is no solution**

The question asks us to find two arrays a and b, each of length n and with no elements in common, so that p=merge(a,b). If there is no such solution, we should return "NO".

**4. Using a brute-force approach**

The brute-force approach is to try all possible combinations of a and b. This is very inefficient. We can use a more efficient algorithm to solve this problem.

**5. Not handling the edge cases**

The edge cases are the cases where the input data is invalid or there is no solution. We need to handle these cases carefully.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the output contains a non-integer number, the program may crash.

**3. Incorrect calculation**

The program may make mistakes in the calculation process, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program uses the wrong formula to calculate the sum of scores, the result will be incorrect.

**4. Memory leak**

The program may not release memory properly, which may lead to a memory leak. This can cause the program to slow down or even crash.

**5. Race condition**

The program may not be thread-safe, which may lead to race conditions. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or even crash.

**6. Deadlock**

The program may deadlock, which means that it will stop responding and the user will not be able to use the program. This can happen when two or more threads are waiting for each other to finish, but neither thread can finish because it is waiting for the other thread.

**7. Security vulnerability**

The program may have security vulnerabilities, which may allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or the system. For example, the program may not properly validate user input, which could allow attackers to inject malicious code into the program.
Test inputs:

```

This program has a memory leak because it does not release the memory allocated for the `snakes` and `scores` arrays. This can cause the program to slow down or even crash.

**Race condition**

```

Title:
CODEFORCES 1447_B. Numbers Box

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem states that we can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):

  * Choose any two adjacent cells and multiply the values in them by -1. Two cells are called adjacent if they share a side. 

This means that we can choose the same two cells multiple times, as long as they are adjacent. For example, if we have a grid with two rows and two columns, and the values in the cells are `a` and `b`, we can perform the operation `(a, b) -> (-a, -b)` twice to get the values `a` and `b` back to their original values.

2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution should iterate through all of the cells in the grid, and for each cell, it should check if there is another cell that is adjacent to it. If there is, the solution should multiply the values in the two cells by -1.

3. **Incorrect testing of the solution.** The solution should be tested on a variety of inputs, including inputs that are small, large, and challenging. The solution should also be tested on inputs that are invalid, such as inputs that have negative numbers or numbers that are too large.

4. **Incorrect documentation of the solution.** The solution should be well-documented, so that other developers can understand how it works. The documentation should include a description of the problem, the solution, and the testing process.

5. **Incorrect deployment of the solution.** The solution should be deployed in a way that is secure and reliable. The solution should also be deployed in a way that is easy to update and maintain.

CODEFORCES 1472_A. Cards for Friends

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input is "1 2 3", the program will expect three integers, but only two are provided.
2. **Incorrect variable type**. The variable type is not correctly specified, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input is "1 2 3", the variable `n` should be an integer, but it is declared as a string.
3. **Incorrect operator usage**. The operator is used incorrectly, which may cause the program to produce incorrect results. For example, if the input is "1 2 3", the operator `+` is used to add two integers, but it is actually used to concatenate two strings.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The program does not account for the possibility of an off-by-one error, which may cause the program to produce incorrect results. For example, if the input is "1 2 3", the program may incorrectly count the number of sheets of paper as 4 instead of 3.
5. **Infinite loop**. The program enters an infinite loop, which may cause the program to crash or freeze. For example, if the input is "1 2 3", the program may enter an infinite loop while trying to divide `w` by `2`.
6. **Memory leak**. The program does not properly release memory, which may cause the program to run out of memory and crash. For example, if the program creates a new array in each iteration of a loop, the array will not be released when the loop is finished, and the program will eventually run out of memory.
7. **Security vulnerability**. The program has a security vulnerability, which may allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system. For example, if the program accepts user input without properly validating it, an attacker could enter malicious code that could be executed by the program.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1498_C. Planar Reflections

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect implementation of the recursive solution.** The recursive solution is a common approach to this problem, but it is easy to make mistakes when implementing it. One common mistake is to forget to update the value of `n` when calling the recursive function on the left and right sides of the plane. Another common mistake is to forget to check the base case of `k == 1`.
* **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic.** Modulo arithmetic is essential for this problem, as the size of the multiset can be very large. However, it is easy to make mistakes when using modulo arithmetic. One common mistake is to forget to add `MOD` to the result of a modulo operation. Another common mistake is to use the wrong modulus.
* **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The size of the multiset can be very large, so it is important to be careful about overflow. One common mistake is to use an integer type that is too small to store the size of the multiset. Another common mistake is to perform arithmetic operations on integers that are too large.
* **Incorrect use of the Sieve of Eratosthenes.** The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a common technique for finding all of the prime numbers up to a given limit. However, it is easy to make mistakes when using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. One common mistake is to forget to initialize the array of prime numbers. Another common mistake is to forget to mark composite numbers as non-prime.

**How to avoid these problems:**

* To avoid incorrect implementation of the recursive solution, carefully review the code and make sure that you understand how it works. Use a debugger to step through the code and verify that it is correct.
* To avoid incorrect use of modulo arithmetic, carefully review the code and make sure that you are using the correct modulus. Use a debugger to step through the code and verify that the results are correct.
* To avoid incorrect handling of overflow, use an integer type that is large enough to store the size of the multiset. Carefully review the code and make sure that you are not performing arithmetic operations on integers that are too large.
* To avoid incorrect use of the Sieve of Eratosthenes, carefully review the code and make sure that you are initializing the array of prime numbers and marking composite numbers as non-prime. Use a debugger to step through the code and verify that the results are correct.

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format of the problem is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the solution. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the solution may crash.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The data type of the input and output values may not be correctly specified, which may lead to errors in the solution. For example, if the input values are strings, but the solution expects them to be integers, the solution may crash.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the solution may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the solution does not take into account all of the constraints of the problem, the solution may produce incorrect results.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are common in programming, and they can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the solution iterates through an array one element too many or one element too few, the solution may produce incorrect results.
5. **Memory leaks.** Memory leaks occur when a program allocates memory but does not release it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions.** Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
7. **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, and neither thread can progress. This can lead to the program running indefinitely or crashing.
8. **Buffer overflows.** Buffer overflows occur when a program writes data to a buffer that is not large enough to hold the data. This can lead to the program crashing or the execution of arbitrary code.
9. **Format string vulnerabilities.** Format string vulnerabilities occur when a program uses a format string that is not properly sanitized. This can lead to the program being tricked into executing arbitrary code.
10. **SQL injection vulnerabilities.** SQL injection vulnerabilities occur when a program accepts user input that is used to construct a SQL query. This can lead to the program being tricked into executing arbitrary SQL code, which can lead to data breaches or other security problems.

Title:
CODEFORCES 175_D. Plane of Tanks: Duel

Pain points:
### Possible problems and bugs

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly parsed by the program. This can lead to errors in the calculation of the probability of victory.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the probability of victory**. The probability of victory is calculated by the formula

```
P = 1 - (1 - p)^n
```

where n is the number of shots fired by the enemy tank. However, this formula is only valid if the shots are fired independently. In the case of the Plane of Tanks problem, the shots are not independent, because the damage from the first shot can affect the probability of the second shot piercing the armor.
3. **Incorrect handling of ties**. In the case of a tie, the program should return a probability of 0.5. However, some programs return a probability of 1 or 0, which is incorrect.
4. **Incorrect handling of overflows**. The program should be careful not to overflow when calculating the probability of victory. This can happen if the number of shots fired by the enemy tank is large.
5. **Incorrect handling of floating-point numbers**. The program should be careful not to lose precision when calculating the probability of victory. This can happen if the number of shots fired by the enemy tank is small.

### How to avoid these problems

1. **Use the correct input format**. The input format for the Plane of Tanks problem is described in the problem statement. Make sure that your program is correctly parsing the input format.
2. **Correctly calculate the probability of victory**. The probability of victory is calculated by the formula

```
P = 1 - (1 - p)^n
```

where n is the number of shots fired by the enemy tank. However, this formula is only valid if the shots are fired independently. In the case of the Plane of Tanks problem, the shots are not independent, because the damage from the first shot can affect the probability of the second shot piercing the armor. To correctly calculate the probability of victory, you need to take into account the correlation between the shots.
3. **Correctly handle ties**. In the case of a tie, the program should return a probability of 0.5. Some programs return a probability of 1 or 0, which is incorrect. To correctly handle ties, you need to use the following formula:

```
P = 1 - (1 - p)^n - (1 - q)^n
```

where p is the probability of the enemy tank winning the first shot, and q is the probability of the enemy tank winning the second shot.
4. **Correctly handle overflows**. The program should be careful not to overflow when calculating the probability of victory. This can happen if the number of shots fired by the enemy tank is large. To avoid overflows, you can use the following techniques:

    * Use the logarithm of the probability instead of the probability itself.
    * Use floating-point arithmetic instead of integer arithmetic.
    * Use a library that provides overflow protection.
5. **Correctly handle floating-point numbers**. The program should be careful not to lose precision when calculating the probability of victory. This can happen if the number of shots fired by the enemy tank is small. To avoid losing precision, you can use the following techniques:

    * Use the correct number of significant digits.
    * Use a library that provides floating-point rounding.
    * Use a library that provides interval arithmetic.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a space instead of a comma, the program may not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect variable initialization**. It is important to initialize variables correctly, otherwise the program may not work as expected. For example, if a variable is initialized to a value that is outside of its expected range, the program may crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be correct in order for the program to work correctly. For example, if the program does not check for errors, it may crash when an error occurs.
4. **Incorrect output**. The output of the program must be correct in order for the program to be useful. For example, if the program outputs the wrong answer, it will not be helpful to the user.
5. **Incorrect error handling**. The program must handle errors correctly in order to avoid crashing. For example, if the program encounters an error, it should print an error message and exit gracefully.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

* Use a proper input format. Make sure that the input format is correct and that the program can parse the input correctly.
* Initialize variables correctly. Make sure that variables are initialized to the correct values before they are used.
* Check for errors. The program should check for errors and handle them gracefully.
* Use the correct logic. The logic of the program must be correct in order for the program to work correctly.
* Make sure the output is correct. The output of the program must be correct in order for the program to be useful.

CODEFORCES 406_D. Hill Climbing

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the rope-climbing algorithm**

The rope-climbing algorithm is a key part of this problem. It determines the order in which the climbers will meet. If the algorithm is implemented incorrectly, the output may be incorrect.

**2. Incorrect handling of ties**

In the problem statement, it is mentioned that "the tops of two hills are connected if the segment connecting their top points does not intersect or touch any of the other hill segments". This means that two hills may be connected by multiple ropes. If the algorithm does not handle ties correctly, the output may be incorrect.

**3. Incorrect handling of input errors**

The input may contain errors, such as invalid hill positions or heights. If the algorithm does not handle input errors correctly, the output may be incorrect or the program may crash.

**4. Incorrect time complexity**

The time complexity of the algorithm should be O(n + m), where n is the number of hills and m is the number of teams. If the algorithm has a higher time complexity, it may not be able to solve large instances of the problem in a reasonable amount of time.

**5. Incorrect space complexity**

The space complexity of the algorithm should be O(n), where n is the number of hills. If the algorithm has a higher space complexity, it may not be able to solve large instances of the problem in a reasonable amount of memory.

CODEFORCES 456_B. Fedya and Maths

Pain points:
1n + 2n + 3n + 4n = 4n(n+1)/2 = 4n^2/2 + 2n/2 = 2n^2 + n. So, the remainder is 4.
  1. **Integer overflow**. The input number can be extremely large, so the developer may need to use a large integer type to store it. For example, in Java, the developer can use `BigInteger`.
2. **Incorrect modulo operation**. The modulo operation (`%`) returns the remainder of the division. However, if the dividend is negative, the modulo operation returns the remainder with the opposite sign. For example, `10 % 5` returns `5`, but `-10 % 5` returns `-1`. The developer needs to be careful about this when dealing with negative numbers.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the expression**. The developer needs to be careful about the order of operations. For example, `1n + 2n + 3n + 4n` is not the same as `(1n + 2n) + (3n + 4n)`.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output should not have any leading zeros. The developer needs to be careful about this when printing the output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 478_E. Wavy numbers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the two integers `n` and `k` should be separated by a single space. However, if the input contains more than one space between the two integers, or if it contains any other characters besides digits, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce an incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the wavy number.** The wavy number `r` is calculated by repeatedly adding `n` to the previous wavy number until the resulting number is divisible by `n` and is also less than or equal to `1014`. However, if the previous wavy number is already divisible by `n`, or if the resulting number is greater than `1014`, the program will not be able to correctly calculate the wavy number and will produce an incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect output.** The output should be a single integer, which is the value of the wavy number `r`. However, if the program outputs more than one integer, or if it outputs a non-integer value, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the program may not be able to handle negative integers, or it may not be able to handle inputs that are too large. It is important to carefully test the program to ensure that it handles all possible input cases correctly.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

* Carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand the input and output formats.
* Test your program on a variety of input cases, including cases that are likely to cause problems.
* Use a debugger to help you track down and fix any bugs that you find.
* Ask for help from a mentor or instructor if you are struggling to solve the problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 552_A. Vanya and Table

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when reading the input data. For example, if the number of rectangles is not an integer, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the sum of values**

The sum of values in all cells of the table can be calculated in different ways. For example, you can sum all the values in each row and then sum the results, or you can sum all the values in each column and then sum the results. It is important to choose the correct method of calculation, otherwise the answer will be incorrect.

**3. Memory overflow**

The table in this problem is very large, so it is possible to run out of memory when trying to store all the values in the table. To avoid this, you can use a more efficient data structure, such as a hash table.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when printing the output data. For example, if the sum of values is not an integer, you need to round it to the nearest integer.

**5. Other bugs**

There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the program may crash if there is an error in the code, or it may produce incorrect results if the input data is not correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 622_C. Not Equal on a Segment

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over the array, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct indices. For example, if you are looking for the first element that is not equal to a given value, you need to start at index 1, not index 0.
2. **Indexing errors.** When accessing elements of an array, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct indices. For example, if you are trying to access the element at index 5, you need to use the expression `a[5]`, not `a[4]`.
3. **Boundary errors.** When iterating over an array, it is important to make sure that you do not go beyond the bounds of the array. For example, if you are iterating over an array of size 10, you need to make sure that you do not try to access the element at index 11.
4. **Data type errors.** When comparing two values, it is important to make sure that they are of the same data type. For example, you cannot compare an integer to a float.
5. **Logic errors.** When writing your code, it is important to make sure that your logic is correct. For example, if you are trying to find the smallest element in an array, you need to make sure that you check all of the elements in the array.
6. **Off-by-one errors.** When using a two-pointer approach, it is important to make sure that you are incrementing and decrementing the pointers by the correct amount. For example, if you are trying to find the longest substring of a string that is a palindrome, you need to make sure that you are incrementing and decrementing the pointers by 1.

Title:
CODEFORCES 643_F. Bears and Juice

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem statement is quite long and detailed, so it is easy to make a mistake while reading it. For example, one might think that the bears must drink from all the barrels they choose, when in fact they only drink from one glass from each barrel.
* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for finding the maximum number of barrels that the bears can win with is quite complex, so it is easy to make a mistake while implementing it. For example, one might forget to check that there are enough places to sleep for all the bears who drink wine.
* **Incorrect test cases.** The test cases provided with the problem are not always sufficient to catch all of the bugs. For example, the first test case only has one bear, so it does not test the case where there are not enough places to sleep.
* **Incorrect runtime analysis.** The algorithm for finding the maximum number of barrels that the bears can win with has a worst-case runtime of O(n^2), so it is important to make sure that the problem does not have too many bears.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** One common mistake is to think that the bears must drink from all the barrels they choose. This is not true; they only need to drink from one glass from each barrel.
* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** Another common mistake is to forget to check that there are enough places to sleep for all the bears who drink wine. This can lead to the bears losing the game even if they could have won if there were enough places to sleep.
* **Incorrect test cases.** The test cases provided with the problem are not always sufficient to catch all of the bugs. For example, the first test case only has one bear, so it does not test the case where there are not enough places to sleep.
* **Incorrect runtime analysis.** The algorithm for finding the maximum number of barrels that the bears can win with has a worst-case runtime of O(n^2), so it is important to make sure that the problem does not have too many bears.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* **Read the problem statement carefully and make sure you understand it before you start coding.**
* **Write out the algorithm before you start coding.** This will help you to identify any potential problems in your implementation.
* **Test your code thoroughly with a variety of test cases.** This will help you to catch any bugs in your code.
* **Analyze the runtime of your algorithm.** This will help you to make sure that your code is efficient enough to solve the problem.

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format of this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that the input is in the correct format, otherwise the program will not work correctly.
2. **Incorrect operations.** The operations in this problem are very specific. It is important to make sure that the operations are performed correctly, otherwise the program will not work correctly.
3. **Incorrect cursor movement.** The cursor in this problem can move to the left or right, and it can also be deleted. It is important to make sure that the cursor is moved correctly, otherwise the program will not work correctly.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The output format of this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that the output is in the correct format, otherwise the program will not work correctly.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems and bugs:

1. **Use a well-defined data structure to represent the bracket sequence.** This will make it easier to perform operations on the bracket sequence.
2. **Write unit tests to verify that your program is working correctly.** This will help you catch any errors in your code before they cause problems.
3. **Be careful when handling the cursor.** The cursor can be easily moved to the wrong position, so it is important to be careful when performing operations that move the cursor.

CODEFORCES 696_B. Puzzles

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the random DFS algorithm.** The pseudocode provided in the problem statement is not complete, and it is easy to make mistakes when implementing it. For example, it is important to make sure that the children of each node are shuffled randomly, and that the current time is incremented before the starting time of the current node is recorded.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the expected value of starting_time[i].** The expected value of starting_time[i] is the average of the starting times of all nodes that are descendants of node i. It is important to take into account the fact that the starting times of the descendants of node i are not independent, and that they are correlated with the starting time of node i.
3. **Numerical errors.** The expected value of starting_time[i] may be a very small number, and it is important to use enough precision to avoid rounding errors.
4. **Time complexity.** The naive implementation of the random DFS algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2). It is possible to improve the time complexity to O(n) by using a more efficient data structure to represent the tree.
5. **Memory usage.** The naive implementation of the random DFS algorithm uses O(n) memory to store the starting times of all nodes. It is possible to reduce the memory usage to O(log n) by using a more efficient data structure to represent the tree.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems and bugs:

* Carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand the problem before you start coding.
* Use a good test suite to thoroughly test your code.
* Use a debugger to help you find and fix bugs.
* Use a compiler with good error checking to help you catch errors early.
* Use a profile tool to help you identify performance bottlenecks.
* Use a memory profiler to help you identify memory leaks.

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of children is not a positive integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values must be correct. For example, if the number of children is a string instead of an integer, the program will crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are common in programming, and they can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program is supposed to print the first 100 elements of a list, but it only prints the first 99 elements, the result will be incorrect.
4. **Logic errors**. Logic errors are errors in the logic of the program. For example, if the program is supposed to find the maximum value in a list, but it finds the minimum value instead, the result will be incorrect.
5. **Memory errors**. Memory errors can occur when the program allocates too much or too little memory. For example, if the program allocates too much memory, it may crash. If the program allocates too little memory, it may not be able to store all of the data it needs.
6. **Synchronization errors**. Synchronization errors can occur when multiple threads are trying to access the same data at the same time. For example, if two threads are trying to update the same variable at the same time, the result may be incorrect.
7. **Race conditions**. Race conditions can occur when the outcome of a program depends on the order in which two or more events occur. For example, if two threads are trying to read the same variable, the outcome may depend on which thread reads the variable first.
8. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. For example, if two threads are both trying to lock the same mutex, the program will deadlock.
9. **Stack overflows**. Stack overflows can occur when a program calls too many functions in a row. For example, if a program calls a function that calls another function that calls another function, and so on, the program may eventually run out of stack space and crash.
10. **Buffer overflows**. Buffer overflows can occur when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold. For example, if a program tries to write 100 bytes to a buffer that can only hold 50 bytes, the program may overwrite the data in the buffer and cause a crash.

CODEFORCES 784_F. Crunching Numbers Just for You

Pain points:
1. **Using the wrong sorting algorithm.** The most common mistake is to use a sorting algorithm that is not designed for sorting integers. For example, bubble sort and selection sort are both O(n^2) algorithms, which means that they will be very slow for large arrays. A better choice would be a sorting algorithm such as merge sort or quick sort, which are both O(n log n) algorithms.
2. **Using a naive implementation of the sorting algorithm.** Even if you use the right sorting algorithm, you can still make mistakes if you implement it incorrectly. For example, you might forget to check for corner cases, or you might use an inefficient data structure.
3. **Not handling errors correctly.** The input to the problem may not always be valid. For example, the input may contain a negative number, or it may contain more than n elements. You need to make sure that your code handles these errors gracefully.
4. **Not testing your code.** It is always important to test your code before submitting it to a competition. This will help you catch any bugs that you may have missed.
5. **Not optimizing your code.** Once you have a working solution, you should try to optimize it to make it run as fast as possible. This may involve using a faster sorting algorithm, or it may involve using a more efficient data structure.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* Using bubble sort to sort the array. Bubble sort is a very inefficient sorting algorithm, and it will be very slow for large arrays.
* Using a naive implementation of merge sort. Merge sort is a recursive algorithm, and it is easy to make mistakes when implementing it recursively.
* Not handling negative numbers correctly. The input to the problem may contain negative numbers, and you need to make sure that your code handles these numbers correctly.
* Not testing your code. It is very important to test your code before submitting it to a competition. This will help you catch any bugs that you may have missed.
* Not optimizing your code. Once you have a working solution, you should try to optimize it to make it run as fast as possible. This may involve using a faster sorting algorithm, or it may involve using a more efficient data structure.

CODEFORCES 830_E. Perpetual Motion Machine

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is given as integers, but the problem statement requires real numbers. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. The problem statement requires that at least one controller be set to a non-zero value. However, if you forget to set one of the controllers, the produced power will be zero and the answer will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The problem statement requires that the consumed power be less than or equal to the produced power. However, if you accidentally add the consumed power to the produced power, the answer will be incorrect.
4. **Memory leaks**. The problem statement does not specify how much memory you can use. If you allocate too much memory, your program may crash.
5. **Timeouts**. The problem statement does not specify a time limit. If your program takes too long to run, it will be marked as incorrect.
6. **Incorrect output format**. The problem statement specifies that the output should be a list of integers. However, if you accidentally print the output in a different format, your answer will be incorrect.

Title:
CODEFORCES 922_A. Cloning Toys

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain more than two integers, or the integers may not be in the correct range.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be either "Yes" or "No", but the developer may output something else.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may not correctly implement the logic of the problem. For example, the developer may not correctly account for the fact that Imp cannot throw toys away or apply the machine to a copy if he doesn't currently have any copies.
4. **Runtime error**. The developer's code may run into a runtime error, such as a segmentation fault or a floating-point exception.
5. **Memory error**. The developer's code may run out of memory.
6. **Security vulnerability**. The developer's code may contain a security vulnerability, such as a buffer overflow or a SQL injection vulnerability.

Title:
CODEFORCES 94_B. Friends

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very strict. It allows for multiple spaces between the numbers, and it also allows for numbers to be written with leading zeros. However, if the input format is not followed correctly, the program will not be able to parse the input and will produce an incorrect output.

To avoid this problem, make sure that the input format is correct. This means that there should be no spaces between the numbers, and that the numbers should not be written with leading zeros.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also not very strict. It allows for multiple spaces between the words, and it also allows for the words to be written in all lowercase or all uppercase. However, if the output format is not followed correctly, the program will not be able to parse the output and will produce an incorrect result.

To avoid this problem, make sure that the output format is correct. This means that there should be no spaces between the words, and that the words should be written in all lowercase.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic of the program is also important. The program needs to be able to correctly identify whether there are either three pairwise acquainted or three pairwise unacquainted people. To do this, the program needs to keep track of the number of acquaintances each person has. If a person has three acquaintances, then they are considered to be pairwise acquainted. If a person does not have any acquaintances, then they are considered to be pairwise unacquainted.

The program also needs to be able to handle the case where there are no acquaintances at all. In this case, the program should output "FAIL".

**4. Incorrect variable names**

The variable names in the program should be descriptive and easy to understand. This will make the code easier to read and debug.

For example, the variable `num_acquaintances` is a good variable name because it clearly describes what the variable is used for. The variable `i` is not a good variable name because it does not provide any information about what the variable is used for.

**5. Incorrect indentation**

The indentation in the program should be consistent. This will make the code easier to read and debug.

For example, the following code is correctly indented:

```
if (num_acquaintances == 3) {
  // The person is pairwise acquainted.
} else if (num_acquaintances == 0) {
  // The person is pairwise unacquainted.
} else {
  // The person is neither pairwise acquainted nor pairwise unacquainted.
}
```

The following code is incorrectly indented:

```
if (num_acquaintances == 3) {
  // The person is pairwise acquainted.
} else if (num_acquaintances == 0) {
  // The person is pairwise unacquainted.
} else {
  // The person is neither pairwise acquainted nor pairwise unacquainted.
}
```
Test inputs:
1. Incorrect input format

```
m = int(input())
for i in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
```

This code will not work because the input format is incorrect. The input should be a single integer, not a list of integers.

2. Incorrect output format

```
m = int(input())
for i in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())

if a == b:
    print("FAIL")
else:
    print("WIN")
```

This code will not work because the output format is incorrect. The output should be a single word, not a two-word phrase.

3. Incorrect logic

```
m = int(input())
for i in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())

num_acquaintances[a] += 1
num_acquaintances[b] += 1

if num_acquaintances[a] == 3 or num_acquaintances[b] == 3:
    print("WIN")
else:
    print("FAIL")
```

This code will not work because it does not correctly identify whether there are either three pairwise acquainted or three pairwise unacquainted people. The code only checks whether one person has three acquaintances, but it does not check whether any other person has three acquaintances.

4. Incorrect variable names

```
m = int(input())
for i in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())

num_acquaintances[a] += 1
num_acquaintances[b] += 1

if num_acquaintances[a] == 3 or num_acquaintances[b] == 3:
    print("WIN")
else:
    print("FAIL")
```

The variable names `num_acquaintances[a]` and `num_acquaintances[b]` are not descriptive. It is not clear what these variables are used for.

5. Incorrect indentation

```
m = int(input())
for i in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())

num_acquaintances[a] += 1
num_acquaintances[b] += 1

if num_acquaintances[a] == 3 or num_acquaintances[b] == 3:
    print("WIN")
else:
    print("FAIL")
```

The code is not correctly indented. The `if` statement should be indented to the same level as the `for` loop.

CODEFORCES 997_D. Cycles in product

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. Make sure that you are reading the input correctly and that you are not missing any of the required information.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer. Make sure that you are not printing any extra information, and that your integer is correctly formatted.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the number of cycles**

The number of cycles in the product of two trees can be calculated using the following formula:

```
C(n_1, k) * C(n_2, k)
```

where C(n, k) is the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of size n.

**4. Using the wrong modulo**

The output for this problem should be modulo 998244353. Make sure that you are using the correct modulo in your calculations.

**5. Overflow**

The number of cycles in the product of two trees can be very large, so it is important to be careful about overflow. Make sure that you are using the correct data types and that you are performing your calculations correctly.

Title:
HACKEREARTH bear-and-bowling-3

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect usage of modulo operator**

The modulo operator (%) is used to return the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 = 1, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.

When using the modulo operator, it is important to make sure that the dividend is less than the divisor. If the dividend is greater than the divisor, the modulo operator will return the remainder of the dividend divided by the divisor, which may not be what you intended.

For example, the following code will print the wrong answer:

```
n = 10
m = 3
print(n % m)
```

This code will print 1, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1. However, we actually want to print 0, because 10 is divisible by 3.

To fix this problem, we can use the following code:

```
n = 10
m = 3
print(n - (n // m) * m)
```

This code will first divide n by m to get the quotient. It will then subtract the quotient from n to get the remainder. This remainder is the correct answer.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a programmer forgets to add or subtract one to a variable. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a program that prints the wrong answer or a program that crashes.

To avoid off-by-one errors, it is important to be careful when performing arithmetic operations on variables. It is also helpful to use a debugger to step through your code and check for errors.

**3. Using the wrong data type**

Another common type of bug is using the wrong data type. For example, a programmer might accidentally use an integer when they should be using a floating-point number. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a program that prints the wrong answer or a program that crashes.

To avoid using the wrong data type, it is important to carefully check the data types of your variables. It is also helpful to use a debugger to step through your code and check for errors.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

Edge cases are situations that are not explicitly handled by the code. For example, a program that only works for positive numbers might not work correctly for negative numbers.

Not handling edge cases can lead to incorrect results, such as a program that crashes or a program that prints the wrong answer.

To avoid not handling edge cases, it is important to test your code with a variety of inputs, including edge cases. It is also helpful to use a debugger to step through your code and check for errors.

**5. Using global variables**

Global variables are variables that are accessible from anywhere in a program. This can be convenient, but it can also lead to problems if the global variables are not used correctly.

For example, a programmer might accidentally change the value of a global variable in one part of the program, which could affect the results of another part of the program.

To avoid using global variables, it is best to use local variables whenever possible. Local variables are only accessible from the function in which they are declared, so they cannot accidentally affect the results of other parts of the program.

**6. Not using comments**

Comments are used to explain the code in a program. This can be helpful for other programmers who need to read and understand the code.

Not using comments can make it difficult for other programmers to understand the code. This can lead to errors, such as a programmer accidentally changing the wrong part of the code.

To avoid not using comments, it is important to add comments to your code whenever possible. This will make it easier for other programmers to understand the code and avoid making mistakes.

Title:
HACKEREARTH clock-mania

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect calculation of angle between hour and minute hand.** The angle between the hour and minute hand is not simply the difference between the two hand positions. The hour hand moves at 30 degrees per hour, while the minute hand moves at 6 degrees per minute. This means that the angle between the two hands will change by 30 degrees every hour and 6 degrees every minute. To calculate the angle between the hour and minute hands, we need to take into account the current time and the position of the hands.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the angle between the hour and minute hands, it is important to make sure that the calculations are done correctly. One common mistake is to forget to add 1 to the hour hand position when calculating the angle. This can lead to an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect input handling.** The input for this problem is a list of pairs of integers, representing the hour and minute hand positions. It is important to make sure that the input is correctly parsed and that the values are within the valid range.
4. **Incorrect output formatting.** The output for this problem should be a single integer, representing the angle between the hour and minute hands. It is important to make sure that the output is correctly formatted and that the value is within the valid range.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these common problems:

* **Use a diagram to help you visualize the problem.** Drawing a diagram of the clock can help you to understand the relationship between the hour and minute hands and to calculate the angle between them.
* **Use a systematic approach to solving the problem.** There are a few different ways to calculate the angle between the hour and minute hands. One common approach is to use the following formula:

```
angle = 30 * (H - M / 60)
```

where H is the hour hand position and M is the minute hand position.
* **Test your code thoroughly.** Once you have written your code, it is important to test it thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. You can test your code by using a variety of different input values and checking that the output is correct.
* **Use a consistent coding style.** When writing your code, it is important to use a consistent coding style. This will make your code easier to read and understand, and it will help to reduce the number of errors.

The input is an integer, but the developer may accidentally use a floating-point type, which will lead to incorrect results.

**2. Not handling the edge cases**

The input may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers greater than the maximum allowed value. The developer must handle these edge cases correctly.

**3. Using incorrect algorithms**

There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. The developer must choose the correct algorithm for the given problem.

**4. Not using efficient data structures**

The developer must use efficient data structures to store the data and to perform the necessary calculations. Using inefficient data structures will lead to slow performance.

**5. Not testing the code thoroughly**

The developer must test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and that it handles all possible input values correctly. Failing to test the code thoroughly can lead to bugs that are difficult to find and fix.

**6. Not using version control**

The developer must use version control to track changes to the code. This will make it easier to identify and fix bugs.

HACKEREARTH magic-sum

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the binary tree traversal algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The traversal algorithm should visit each node in the tree exactly once, and the order in which the nodes are visited should be the same for every tree of the same shape.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the magic sum.** The magic sum is the sum of the values of all the nodes on a path from one leaf node to another. It is important to make sure that the path is unique, and that the same node is not counted more than once.
3. **Incorrect handling of negative numbers.** The magic sum can be negative, so it is important to make sure that the algorithm handles negative numbers correctly.
4. **Incorrect handling of large numbers.** The magic sum can be very large, so it is important to make sure that the algorithm can handle large numbers without overflowing.
5. **Incorrect use of memory.** The algorithm should not use more memory than is necessary. This can be a problem for large trees or trees with many negative numbers.
6. **Incorrect error handling.** The algorithm should handle errors gracefully. This includes errors such as invalid input or trees that are not full binary trees.

Title:
HACKEREARTH nice-p-sequence

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect modular arithmetic

The most common bug when solving this problem is incorrect modular arithmetic. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
def mod_inverse(a, m):
    for i in range(m):
        if (a * i) % m == 1:
            return i
    return -1
```

This code will return the wrong answer for some values of `a` and `m`. For example, if `a = 5` and `m = 7`, the code will return `2`, but the correct answer is `4`.

The correct way to calculate the modular inverse of `a` modulo `m` is to use the extended Euclidean algorithm. This algorithm can be found in many online resources, such as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm).

### 2. Incorrect handling of negative numbers

Another common bug when solving this problem is incorrect handling of negative numbers. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
def nice_p_sequence(a1, p, n):
    if a1 < 0 or p < 0:
        return -1
    else:
        return sum(a1 * pow(a1, i, p) % p for i in range(n))
```

This code will return the wrong answer for some values of `a1` and `p`. For example, if `a1 = -1` and `p = 5`, the code will return `-1`, but the correct answer is `0`.

The correct way to handle negative numbers is to first make them positive by adding `p` to them. For example, if `a1 = -1` and `p = 5`, we would first add `p` to `a1` to get `a1 = -1 + 5 = 4`. We would then continue with the rest of the algorithm as normal.

### 3. Incorrect handling of overflow

Another common bug when solving this problem is incorrect handling of overflow. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
def nice_p_sequence(a1, p, n):
    if a1 < 0 or p < 0:
        return -1
    else:
        return sum(a1 * pow(a1, i, p) for i in range(n))
```

This code will return the wrong answer for some values of `a1`, `p`, and `n`. For example, if `a1 = 10**9` and `p = 10**9`, the code will overflow and return the wrong answer.

The correct way to handle overflow is to use the `int()` function to cast the results of the calculations to integers. For example, the following code would work correctly:

```
def nice_p_sequence(a1, p, n):
    if a1 < 0 or p < 0:
        return -1
    else:
        return int(sum(a1 * pow(a1, i, p) for i in range(n)))
```

### 4. Incorrect handling of edge cases

Another common bug when solving this problem is incorrect handling of edge cases. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
def nice_p_sequence(a1, p, n):
    if a1 < 0 or p < 0:
        return -1
    else:
        return sum(a1 * pow(a1, i, p) for i in range(n))
```

This code will return the wrong answer for some values of `a1`, `p`, and `n`. For example, if `a1 = 0`, the code will return `0` for all values of `p` and `n`.

The correct way to handle edge cases is to check for them explicitly and handle them accordingly. For example, the following code would work correctly:

```
def nice_p_sequence(a1, p, n):
    if a1 < 0 or p < 0:
        return -1
    elif a1 == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return int(sum(a1 * pow(a1, i, p) for i in range(n)))
```

1. **Incorrect calculation of area of intersection of two circles.** The area of intersection of two circles is not simply the difference of their areas. It is given by the formula:

```
A = π * (r1 * r2) * sin(θ)
```

where `r1` and `r2` are the radii of the two circles and `θ` is the angle between their centers.

2. **Incorrect calculation of area of union of two circles.** The area of union of two circles is not simply the sum of their areas. It is given by the formula:

```
A = π * (r1 + r2)^2 - π * (r1^2 + r2^2 - 2 * r1 * r2 * cos(θ))
```

3. **Using the wrong formula for the distance between two points.** The distance between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is given by the formula:

```
d = √(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2
```

4. **Using the wrong formula for the angle between two lines.** The angle between two lines `y = mx + b` and `y = mx + c` is given by the formula:

```
θ = arctan(√((m2 - m1)^2 + (b2 - b1)^2) / (m1 - m2))
```

5. **Using the wrong formula for the sine of an angle.** The sine of an angle `θ` is given by the formula:

```
sin(θ) = opp / hyp
```

where `opp` is the opposite side of the angle and `hyp` is the hypotenuse.

Title:
HACKEREARTH sherlock-holmes-and-the-temple-mystery-7

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input is a list of integers, but the code is expecting a list of strings. This can be fixed by changing the type of the input variable to `list`.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator**. The code is comparing the sum of the costs of the items in one box to the sum of the costs of the items in the other box using the `==` operator. This is incorrect, because the `==` operator only checks if two values are equal, not if they have the same sum. This can be fixed by using the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of the costs of the items in each box, and then comparing the two sums using the `==` operator.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The code is checking if the sum of the costs of the items in one box is equal to the sum of the costs of the items in the other box. However, it is not taking into account the cost of the first item in the first box. This can be fixed by adding the cost of the first item to the sum of the costs of the items in the first box before comparing it to the sum of the costs of the items in the other box.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The code is checking if the sum of the costs of the items in one box is equal to the sum of the costs of the items in the other box. However, it is not checking if the two sums are equal to each other. This can be fixed by adding the cost of the first item to the sum of the costs of the items in the first box, and then checking if the two sums are equal to each other.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The variable `n` should be an integer, but it is a string in the following code:

```
def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = input()
```

2. **Incorrect logic**. The following code does not correctly count the number of ways to empty the jar:

```
def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = input()
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            if n % i == 0:
                count += 1
        print(count)
```

The correct logic is as follows:

```
def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            if n % i == 0:
                count += 1

```

3. **Incorrect output format**. The following code does not print the output in the correct format:

```
def main():

        n = input()
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            if n % i == 0:
                count += 1
        print(count)
```

The correct output format is as follows:

```
def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, n+1):

Title:
ATCODER p02656 AtCoder Grand Contest 045 - Division into Multiples

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input values are very large, so it is important to use the correct data type to avoid overflow. For example, using `int` to store `A`, `X`, `B`, `Y`, and `C` may cause overflow.

**2. Not handling edge cases**

The input may contain edge cases, such as `A = B` or `C = 1`. It is important to handle these edge cases correctly.

**3. Making a mistake in the algorithm**

The algorithm for finding the maximum possible number of good groups is not trivial. It is important to make sure that the algorithm is correct.

**4. Not using efficient data structures**

The input data is large, so it is important to use efficient data structures to store and process the data. For example, using a hash table to store the balls would be more efficient than using a linked list.

**5. Not debugging the code**

It is important to debug the code to find and fix any bugs. This can be done by running the code on a small set of test cases and checking the output.

ATCODER p02785 AtCoder Beginner Contest 153 - Fennec vs Monster

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input specifies that the health of each monster can be up to 10^9, but the default data type for integers in Python is int, which has a maximum value of 2^31-1. This means that if a monster's health is greater than 2^31-1, the integer will overflow and the program will crash. To avoid this, you can use the long data type, which has a maximum value of 2^63-1.

**2. Not handling the case where K is 0**

The problem states that Fennec can use Special Move at most K times. If K is 0, then Fennec cannot use Special Move at all. This means that she must use Attack to defeat all of the monsters. To handle this case, you can check if K is 0 before doing anything else. If K is 0, then you can simply sum the health of all of the monsters and print that number.

**3. Not handling the case where all of the monsters have the same health**

The problem states that the health of each monster can be different. However, it is possible that all of the monsters have the same health. In this case, you can simply divide the total health of all of the monsters by the number of monsters and print that number.

**4. Not handling the case where the total health of all of the monsters is less than K**

The problem states that Fennec can use Special Move at most K times. If the total health of all of the monsters is less than K, then Fennec cannot use Special Move at all. This means that she must use Attack to defeat all of the monsters. To handle this case, you can check if the total health of all of the monsters is less than K before doing anything else. If the total health of all of the monsters is less than K, then you can simply sum the health of all of the monsters and print that number.

Title:
ATCODER p02921 AtCoder Beginner Contest 139 - Tenki

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a string, but the developer may accidentally use an integer or float data type to store it. This will cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**2. Misunderstanding the problem statement**

The problem statement is clear and concise, but it is easy to make a mistake if you don't read it carefully. For example, the developer may mistakenly think that they need to find the number of days for which the forecast was incorrect.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The logic for solving this problem is relatively simple, but it is easy to make a mistake. For example, the developer may accidentally count the number of days for which the forecast was correct instead of the number of days for which it was incorrect.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement does not explicitly mention any edge cases, but there are a few that the developer should be aware of. For example, the input data may contain invalid characters, or the forecast and actual weather may be the same for all three days.

**5. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly. The developer should test the code with a variety of input data, including valid and invalid data, and edge cases.

ATCODER p03056 AtCoder Grand Contest 033 - Complexity

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not clear.**

The input format is not clear. It is not clear how to input the grid. For example, if the grid is 3x3, should I input it as 3 3 .. ... #. #. or 3 3 ... .. #. #.?

**2. The output format is not clear.**

The output format is not clear. It is not clear how to output the complexity of the grid. For example, if the complexity is 2, should I output 2 or 02?

**3. The problem is not well-defined.**

The problem is not well-defined. It is not clear what it means for a grid to be "divided into two subgrids by a line parallel to one of the sides of the grid". For example, if the grid is 3x3 and I divide it into two subgrids by a line parallel to the top side, what are the two subgrids?

**4. The problem is too hard.**

The problem is too hard. The complexity of the algorithm is O(HW^2), which is too large for grids with a large number of rows and columns.

**5. The problem is not interesting.**

The problem is not interesting. It is just a simple exercise in dynamic programming.

Title:
ATCODER p03200 AtCoder Grand Contest 029 - Irreversible operation

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input string S can be very long, so it's important to use the correct data type to store it. If you use a small data type like a char array, you may run into problems when S is longer than the array's size.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The problem asks you to find the maximum possible number of times the operation can be performed. A naive algorithm would be to iterate through all possible pairs of indices (i, i + 1) and check if the corresponding pieces are black and white, respectively. This algorithm would have a time complexity of O(N^2), which is too slow for large values of N.

A more efficient algorithm would be to use a sliding window. A sliding window is a data structure that maintains a fixed-size window of elements from a larger data set. In this case, we can use a sliding window to keep track of the number of black and white pieces in the input string. We can then use this information to determine the maximum possible number of times the operation can be performed.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When iterating through the input string, it's important to be careful about off-by-one errors. For example, if you're trying to find the index of the first white piece in the string, you need to make sure that you don't accidentally include the index of the first black piece.

**4. Incorrect boundary conditions**

When solving a problem, it's important to make sure that you handle all of the boundary conditions correctly. For example, if the input string is empty, you need to return 0.

**5. Using global variables**

In general, it's best to avoid using global variables. Global variables can make your code more difficult to read and debug. In this case, you can use local variables instead of global variables to store the state of the sliding window.

**6. Not using a test suite**

It's always a good idea to write a test suite to verify that your code is working correctly. A test suite will help you catch bugs early on, before they cause problems in production.
Test inputs:
```
# 1. Using the wrong data type
S = 'BBBBBBBBB'

S = ''

# 5. Using global variables
S = 'BWBWBW'

# 6. Not using a test suite
S = 'BWBWBW'

Title:
ATCODER p03347 AtCoder Grand Contest 024 - Sequence Growing Easy

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a sequence of integers, so we need to use an integer data type to store the elements of the sequence. If we use the wrong data type, such as a floating-point number, we may get incorrect results.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming algorithm. If we use the wrong algorithm, we may get incorrect results or the algorithm may run in exponential time.

**3. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

The problem statement specifies that the length of the sequence A is at most 2 * 10^5. If we do not check this boundary condition, the program may crash or give incorrect results.

**4. Not handling errors correctly**

The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input data is invalid. If we do not handle errors correctly, the program may crash or give incorrect results.

**5. Not using efficient data structures**

The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming algorithm. A dynamic programming algorithm works by storing the results of subproblems in a table. If we do not use an efficient data structure to store the results of the subproblems, the algorithm may run in exponential time.

**6. Not using idiomatic code**

The problem can be solved using a relatively simple algorithm. If we write the code in a non-idiomatic way, the code may be difficult to read and maintain.

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data contains very large integers. If we use an incorrect data type, such as `int`, the program will overflow and give incorrect results.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the position of the K-th flower from the west. A naive algorithm would be to iterate through all the flowers and find the one that is the K-th flower from the west. However, this algorithm is very inefficient. A more efficient algorithm would be to use a binary search.

**3. Not handling special cases correctly**

The problem mentions that more than one flower may be planted at the same position. We need to handle this case correctly in our algorithm.

**4. Using incorrect variable names**

Using incorrect variable names can make the code difficult to read and understand. For example, using `k` to represent the number of flowers instead of `N` can be confusing.

**5. Not commenting the code**

Commenting the code is important for making it readable and understandable. It also helps other developers understand what the code is doing.

Pain points:
**1. Input format**

The input format is not very clear. It is not clear how to represent the red and blue edges. It is also not clear how to represent the two players' initial positions.

**2. Edges forming a tree**

The problem statement says that the red and blue edges form trees. However, it is not clear what this means. Does it mean that the edges are connected in a cycle? Or does it mean that the edges are connected in a way that there is no way to get from one vertex to another without passing through an edge?

**3. Optimal play**

The problem statement says that the players play optimally to achieve their respective objectives. However, it is not clear what this means. Does it mean that the players always make the best possible move? Or does it mean that the players make the best possible move given the information they have?

**4. Finite number of turns**

The problem statement says that the game will end in a finite number of turns if the players play optimally. However, it is not clear how to prove this.

**5. Negative answer**

The problem statement says that the output should be `-1` if the game will not end in a finite number of turns. However, it is not clear how to determine if the game will not end in a finite number of turns.

Title:
AIZU p00370 Lake Survey

Pain points:
**1. Input Format**

The input is given in the following format:

```
x_s y_s
x_g y_g
N
x_1 y_1
x_2 y_2
:
x_N y_N
```

The first line provides the start point of the survey `x_s`, `y_s` (0≤`x_s`,`y_s≤104`), and the second line provides the end point `x_g`, `y_g` (0 ≤ `x_g`,`y_g ≤ 104`) all in integers. The third line provides the number of apexes `N` (3 ≤ `N ≤ 100`) of the polygon that represents the lake, and each of the subsequent `N` lines provides the coordinate of the `i`-th apex `x_i`,`y_i` (0 ≤ `x_i`,`y_i ≤ 104`) in counter-clockwise order. These data satisfy the following criteria:

* Start and end points of the expedition are not within the area enclosed by the polygon nor on boundaries.
* Start and end points of the expedition are not identical, i.e., `x_s ≠ x_g` or `y_s ≠ y_g`.
* No duplicate coordinates are given, i.e., if `i ≠ j` then `x_i ≠ x_j` or `y_i ≠ y_j`.
* The area enclosed by the polygon has a positive value.
* Any three coordinates that define an area are not aligned on a line.

**2. Output Format**

Output the distance of the shortest possible expedition route. Any number of decimal places can be selected as long as the error does not exceed ± 10-3.

**3. Possible Problems and Bugs**

* The input format is not correctly parsed.
* The input data does not satisfy the criteria.
* The algorithm for finding the shortest possible expedition route is incorrect.
* The output format is incorrect.

Here are some specific examples of problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* The input format is not correctly parsed. For example, if the input data is not in the correct format, the program may crash or output incorrect results.
* The input data does not satisfy the criteria. For example, if the start and end points of the expedition are within the area enclosed by the polygon or on boundaries, the program may crash or output incorrect results.
* The algorithm for finding the shortest possible expedition route is incorrect. For example, if the algorithm does not take into account the fact that the expedition cannot wade across the lake, the program may output incorrect results.
* The output format is incorrect. For example, if the output does not have the correct number of decimal places, the program may be rejected by the grader.

**4. How to Avoid These Problems and Bugs**

To avoid these problems and bugs, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the criteria for the input data and output format. It is also important to test the program thoroughly with a variety of input data to ensure that it is working correctly.

Here are some specific tips for avoiding these problems and bugs:

* Use a well-defined data structure to store the input data. This will help to ensure that the data is correctly parsed and processed.
* Write unit tests to test the individual components of the program. This will help to identify and fix bugs early on.
* Conduct a thorough system test with a variety of input data. This will help to ensure that the program is working correctly under all conditions.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
AIZU p01426 Vector Compression

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that the input is in the correct format. Otherwise, the program will not be able to process the input correctly and will likely produce incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect vector dimensions**

The dimensions of the vectors must be the same for all vectors. If the dimensions of the vectors are different, the program will not be able to process the input correctly and will likely produce incorrect results.

**3. Arithmetic errors**

When computing the sum of the squared lengths of the vectors, it is important to make sure that the calculations are performed correctly. Otherwise, the results may be inaccurate.

**4. Floating-point errors**

Floating-point numbers are not exact representations of real numbers. This means that when performing calculations with floating-point numbers, there is always the possibility of rounding errors. These errors can accumulate over time and lead to incorrect results.

**5. Numerical instability**

Some numerical algorithms can be unstable, which means that small changes in the input can lead to large changes in the output. This can make it difficult to get accurate results.

**6. Overflow errors**

When computing the sum of the squared lengths of the vectors, it is possible to overflow the floating-point representation. This can happen if the sum of the squared lengths is too large. If this happens, the program will crash.

**7. Underflow errors**

When computing the sum of the squared lengths of the vectors, it is possible to underflow the floating-point representation. This can happen if the sum of the squared lengths is too small. If this happens, the results will be inaccurate.

**8. Incorrect output format**

The output of the program must be in the correct format. Otherwise, the program will not be able to produce correct results.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type.** The input data is a string, but the developer may accidentally treat it as an integer. This will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect logic.** The developer may not correctly account for all of the possible cases. For example, they may not consider the case where two words are identical except for one character.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** The developer may accidentally miscount the number of characters in a word or the number of ways to restore the dictionary.
4. **Memory leaks.** The developer may not free up memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
5. **Race conditions.** The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
6. **Security vulnerabilities.** The developer may not properly protect sensitive data. This can allow attackers to access or modify data that they should not be able to.
7. **Unintentional consequences.** The developer may not fully understand the implications of their code. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as the program performing slower than expected or using more memory than necessary.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid common problems and bugs when solving programming problems.

Title:
AIZU p02019 Training

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input variables `N`, `A`, `B`, and `C` are all integers, but the code incorrectly interprets them as strings. This can lead to errors when performing calculations on the variables.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The code incorrectly calculates the number of numbers that are neither multiples of 2 nor multiples of 3. This is because it subtracts the number of multiples of 2 from the number of multiples of 3, instead of subtracting the number of multiples of 2 and 3 from the total number of numbers.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The code incorrectly outputs the number of numbers that are neither multiples of 2 nor multiples of 3. This is because it does not account for the fact that the last number in the input list is not included in the calculation.
4. **Incorrect indentation**. The code is incorrectly indented, which can make it difficult to read and understand. This can lead to errors when debugging the code.
5. **Missing semicolons**. The code is missing semicolons after some of the statements, which can lead to errors when the code is compiled.
6. **Unused variables**. The code contains unused variables, which can lead to errors when the code is compiled.
7. **Unnecessary variables**. The code contains unnecessary variables, which can make it more difficult to read and understand.
8. **Redundant code**. The code contains redundant code, which can make it more difficult to read and understand.
9. **Inefficient code**. The code is inefficient, which can slow down the program.
10. **Unsecure code**. The code is insecure, which can make it vulnerable to attacks.

Title:
AIZU p02161 1333

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains integers $ N, Q, L_i, R_i $. If we use the wrong data type to store these values, it may cause errors. For example, if we use `int` to store `N`, `Q`, `L_i`, and `R_i`, it may overflow when `N` or `Q` is large.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the longest substring that can be represented as `AXBXCX`. We can use a dynamic programming algorithm to solve this problem. However, if we use the wrong algorithm, it may not give the correct answer.

**3. Incorrect boundary conditions**

The problem states that `1 <= L_i <= R_i <= N`. We need to make sure that our algorithm handles these boundary conditions correctly. For example, if `L_i = 1` and `R_i = N`, the longest substring that can be represented as `AXBXCX` is `S[1:N]`.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

When we are computing the longest substring that can be represented as `AXBXCX`, we need to make sure that we do not make off-by-one errors. For example, if we are computing the longest substring that can be represented as `AXBXCX` in the string `S = 'abc'`, we need to make sure that we include the character `c` in the substring.

**5. Using uninitialized variables**

We need to make sure that we initialize all variables before using them. For example, if we declare a variable `i` and do not initialize it, it may contain garbage values. This can lead to incorrect results.

**6. Using incorrect data structures**

The problem requires us to store the longest substring that can be represented as `AXBXCX`. We can use a data structure such as a `vector` or a `set` to store this information. However, if we use the wrong data structure, it may not be able to store the information correctly.

**7. Not handling errors correctly**

The problem may contain errors such as invalid input. We need to make sure that we handle these errors correctly. For example, if the input contains a negative number, we need to print an error message and exit the program.

Title:
AIZU p02302 Convex Cut

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the number of points in the polygon is not given in the first line.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the area of the cut polygon is not strictly followed. For example, the output is not a decimal fraction with an error less than 0.00001.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the area of the cut polygon**. The area of the cut polygon is not calculated correctly. For example, the area of the cut polygon is negative.
4. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**. The algorithm for calculating the area of the cut polygon is not implemented correctly. For example, the algorithm does not take into account all the points of the polygon.
5. **Incorrect error handling**. The algorithm does not handle errors correctly. For example, the algorithm does not handle the case when the line p1p2 does not intersect the polygon.

Title:
AIZU p02449 Permutation

Pain points:
1 2 3 **Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs That a Developer May Encounter When Solving This Problem**

1. **Incorrectly using the `next_permutation()` function.** This function takes a vector as input and returns a new vector with the next lexicographically-ordered permutation of the elements in the input vector. If the input vector is already in the last possible permutation, the function will return an empty vector.
2. **Not handling the case where the input vector is empty.** The `next_permutation()` function will throw an error if the input vector is empty. Be sure to check for this case and handle it appropriately.
3. **Using the `prev_permutation()` function incorrectly.** This function takes a vector as input and returns a new vector with the previous lexicographically-ordered permutation of the elements in the input vector. If the input vector is already in the first possible permutation, the function will return an empty vector.
4. **Not handling the case where the input vector is already in the first or last possible permutation.** In these cases, the `next_permutation()` and `prev_permutation()` functions will return empty vectors. Be sure to handle this case appropriately.
5. **Using the `sort()` function incorrectly.** This function takes a vector as input and sorts the elements in ascending order. If the input vector is already sorted, the function will not change it. Be sure to check for this case and handle it appropriately.
6. **Not handling the case where the input vector contains duplicate elements.** The `next_permutation()` and `prev_permutation()` functions will not work correctly on vectors that contain duplicate elements. Be sure to handle this case appropriately.

**Additional Tips**

1. When using the `next_permutation()` and `prev_permutation()` functions, it is helpful to keep track of the current permutation of the elements in the input vector. This can be done by using a variable to store the index of the last element that was swapped in the previous permutation.
2. When handling the case where the input vector is empty, it is helpful to use the `vector<int>()` constructor to create an empty vector.
3. When handling the case where the input vector is already in the first or last possible permutation, it is helpful to use the `return` statement to exit the function early.
4. When handling the case where the input vector contains duplicate elements, it is helpful to use the `sort()` function to sort the elements in ascending order before calling the `next_permutation()` or `prev_permutation()` functions.
