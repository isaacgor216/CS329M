Title:
CODECHEF cc1

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect variable type**

The problem states that the grid is n x n, but the developer may accidentally declare it as m x n. This would cause the code to incorrectly calculate the distance between Chris Brown and Rihanna.

**2. Incorrect calculation of distance**

The problem states that Chris Brown can move only diagonally, so the developer must take this into account when calculating the distance between him and Rihanna. For example, if Chris Brown is at (1, 1) and Rihanna is at (3, 3), the distance between them is 2√2, not 4.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

The developer may accidentally offset the coordinates of Chris Brown or Rihanna by one, which would cause the code to incorrectly calculate the distance between them. For example, if Chris Brown is at (1, 1) and Rihanna is at (3, 3), the developer may accidentally calculate the distance as 3√2, instead of 2√2.

**4. Infinite loops**

The developer may accidentally create an infinite loop in their code. This could happen if they use a while loop without a condition that will eventually terminate the loop. For example, the following code would create an infinite loop:

```
while True:
  # Do something
```

**5. Incorrect use of functions**

The developer may accidentally use a function incorrectly. For example, they may call a function with the wrong arguments or they may not return a value from a function when they are supposed to.

**6. Memory leaks**

The developer may accidentally create a memory leak in their code. This could happen if they allocate memory that they do not free later. For example, the following code would create a memory leak:

```
x = malloc(100)
```

**7. Security vulnerabilities**

The developer may accidentally introduce a security vulnerability in their code. This could happen if they use insecure coding practices, such as using weak passwords or storing sensitive data in plaintext.

**8. Errors in documentation**

The developer may accidentally write incorrect or incomplete documentation for their code. This could make it difficult for other developers to understand how the code works and could lead to errors.

**9. Bugs in unit tests**

The developer may accidentally write incorrect or incomplete unit tests for their code. This could make it difficult to catch bugs in the code and could lead to errors being released into production.

**10. Failure to test edge cases**

The developer may fail to test edge cases in their code. This could lead to bugs being released into production that only occur in specific circumstances.

Title:
CODECHEF hes

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain a number that is not in the range 1 to 9 inclusive, or the exponent may be negative. The developer should check the input format and handle invalid inputs appropriately.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The developer may make a mistake when calculating the sum of the digits of the final result. For example, the developer may forget to carry over the digits when multiplying two numbers. The developer should carefully check their calculations to ensure that they are correct.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correct. For example, the output may not contain two numbers separated by a single blank character. The developer should ensure that the output format is correct.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer may not free up memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to memory leaks, which can eventually cause the program to crash. The developer should use the `delete` keyword to free up memory that is no longer needed.
5. **Synchronization issues**. The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared resources. This can lead to race conditions, which can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash. The developer should use locks or other synchronization mechanisms to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.

Title:
CODECHEF ren2013k

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the GCD algorithm.** The GCD algorithm is a recursive function that takes two integers as input and returns their greatest common divisor. A common mistake is to use the wrong base case, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the following implementation of the GCD algorithm is incorrect:

```
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return gcd(b, a % b)
```

This implementation will return the wrong answer for inputs such as `(10, 15)`, because it will incorrectly return `5` instead of `1`. The correct base case for the GCD algorithm is `a == b`, which returns `a`.

2. **Incorrect handling of negative numbers.** The GCD algorithm can only be used to find the greatest common divisor of two positive integers. If either of the inputs is negative, the GCD algorithm will return an incorrect result. For example, the following implementation of the GCD algorithm will return `-1` for inputs such as `(-10, 15)`:

```
def gcd(a, b):
    if a < 0:
        a = -a
    if b < 0:
        b = -b
    return gcd(a, b)
```

The correct way to handle negative numbers is to first convert them to positive numbers, then call the GCD algorithm.

3. **Incorrect handling of floating-point numbers.** The GCD algorithm can only be used to find the greatest common divisor of two integers. If either of the inputs is a floating-point number, the GCD algorithm will return an incorrect result. For example, the following implementation of the GCD algorithm will return `0` for inputs such as `(1.0, 2.0)`:

```
def gcd(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b)
```

The correct way to handle floating-point numbers is to first convert them to integers, then call the GCD algorithm.

4. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The GCD algorithm can sometimes overflow if the inputs are large. For example, the following implementation of the GCD algorithm will overflow for inputs such as `(2 ** 63, 2 ** 63)`:

```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```

The correct way to handle overflow is to use a different algorithm, such as the Euclidean algorithm.

5. **Incorrect handling of special cases.** The GCD algorithm has a few special cases that need to be handled correctly. For example, the GCD of two equal numbers is equal to that number, and the GCD of zero and any other number is equal to that number. The following implementation of the GCD algorithm does not handle these special cases correctly:

```
def gcd(a, b):
    if a == 0:
        return b
    elif b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)
```

The correct way to handle these special cases is to check for them before calling the GCD algorithm.
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the GCD algorithm.**

```
Test case 1:

1 3

Expected output:

3

Actual output:

1
```

The incorrect implementation of the GCD algorithm in the program returns `1` instead of `3`.

2. **Incorrect handling of negative numbers.**

```
Test case 2:

-10 15

Expected output:

-5

Actual output:

5
```

The incorrect handling of negative numbers in the program returns `5` instead of `-5`.

3. **Incorrect handling of floating-point numbers.**

```
Test case 3:

1.0 2.0

Expected output:

1

Actual output:

0
```

The incorrect handling of floating-point numbers in the program returns `0` instead of `1`.

4. **Incorrect handling of overflow.**

```
Test case 4:

2 ** 63 2 ** 63

Expected output:

2 ** 63

Actual output:

OverflowError
```

The incorrect handling of overflow in the program causes an `OverflowError`.

5. **Incorrect handling of special cases.**

```
Test case 5:

0 1

Expected output:

1

Actual output:

0
```

The incorrect handling of special cases in the program returns `0` instead of `1`.
Title:
CODECHEF tsort

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly specified, so it is possible that the input will be in a different format than expected. For example, the input may contain spaces between the numbers, or the numbers may be in a different order. This can cause the program to crash or output incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is also not strictly specified, so it is possible that the output will be in a different format than expected. For example, the output may not be sorted in non-decreasing order, or the numbers may be separated by different characters. This can cause the program to crash or output incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect data type.** The input and output data types are not strictly specified, so it is possible that the program will attempt to read or write data of the wrong type. This can cause the program to crash or output incorrect results.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** When sorting a list of numbers, it is important to make sure that the numbers are sorted in the correct order. A common mistake is to forget to increment or decrement the index when comparing two numbers. This can cause the numbers to be sorted incorrectly.
5. **Algorithmic complexity.** The algorithm used to sort the list of numbers should be efficient. A naive algorithm, such as bubble sort, can be very inefficient for large lists of numbers. A more efficient algorithm, such as merge sort or quick sort, should be used instead.
6. **Memory usage.** The program should be designed to use as little memory as possible. This is especially important for embedded systems with limited memory resources.
7. **Reliability.** The program should be designed to be reliable and robust. This means that it should be able to handle unexpected input and errors gracefully. The program should also be able to recover from crashes and other unexpected events.
8. **Maintainability.** The program should be easy to maintain and modify. This means that the code should be well-written and well-documented. The program should also be structured in a way that makes it easy to understand and modify.

CODEFORCES 1152_F2. Neko Rules the Catniverse (Large Version)

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect modular arithmetic**

When doing modular arithmetic, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct modulus. In this problem, the modulus is 10^9 + 7. This means that if you perform an arithmetic operation that results in a number greater than 10^9 + 7, you need to reduce it modulo 10^9 + 7.

For example, if you have the expression `a + b`, and `a` and `b` are both less than 10^9 + 7, then the result of the expression will also be less than 10^9 + 7. However, if `a` is greater than 10^9 + 7, then the result of the expression will be greater than 10^9 + 7. In this case, you need to reduce the result modulo 10^9 + 7.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of mistake that can be made when programming. This type of error occurs when you forget to add or subtract one from a number. In this problem, it is important to make sure that you are correctly counting the number of ways to visit k planets.

For example, if you are trying to find the number of ways to visit k planets, and you start by counting the number of ways to visit k - 1 planets, you will forget to include the case where the first planet is visited twice. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**3. Incorrect use of data structures**

When solving problems with large data sets, it is important to use data structures that are efficient for the task at hand. In this problem, the input data is a list of integers. A good data structure to use for this type of data is a vector.

A vector is a data structure that stores a sequence of elements. The elements in a vector can be accessed by their index. This makes vectors a good choice for problems where you need to access the elements of a list in a specific order.

**4. Incorrect use of algorithms**

When solving problems, it is important to use algorithms that are efficient for the problem at hand. In this problem, the goal is to find the number of ways to visit k planets. A good algorithm to use for this problem is the dynamic programming algorithm.

The dynamic programming algorithm works by first building up a table of values. The values in the table represent the number of ways to visit k planets, starting from a given planet. Once the table is built, the algorithm can be used to find the answer to the problem.

**5. Incorrect error handling**

It is important to handle errors correctly when programming. In this problem, there are a few potential errors that could occur. For example, the input data could be invalid, or the algorithm could run into a runtime error.

It is important to make sure that your code handles these errors gracefully. This means that your code should print an error message and exit if an error occurs.

P(n, f(p)) = (n! / f(p)!)^n
```

However, some developers might mistakenly use the following formula:

```
P(n, f(p)) = (n! / f(p))^n * f(p)!
```

This formula is incorrect because it double-counts the permutations. For example, if n = 3 and f(p) = 2, then the permutation [1, 2, 3] is counted twice by this formula: once when f(p) = 2 and once when f(p) = 1.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

Another common mistake is to use an incorrect algorithm to find the maximum f(p). One common mistake is to simply sort the numbers in the permutation and then take the GCD of the sorted numbers. However, this algorithm does not always give the correct answer. For example, if n = 3 and the permutation is [1, 3, 2], then the GCD of the sorted numbers is 1, but the maximum f(p) is 2.

The correct algorithm for finding the maximum f(p) is to use a dynamic programming approach. The following is a pseudocode for the algorithm:

```
def find_max_f(n):
  """
  Finds the maximum value of f(p) for a permutation of length n.

  Args:
    n: The length of the permutation.

  Returns:
    The maximum value of f(p).
  """

  # Create a table to store the maximum f(p) for all subpermutations.

  f = [[0 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]

  # Initialize the table.

  for i in range(n + 1):
    f[i][0] = 1

  # Iterate over all subpermutations.

  for i in range(1, n + 1):
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
      # Find the GCD of the first i elements of the subpermutation.

      gcd = gcd(p[i - 1], p[j - 1])

      # Update the table.

      f[i][j] = f[i - 1][j] + f[i][j - 1] - f[i - 1][j - 1] * gcd

  # Return the maximum value of f(p).

  return f[n][n]
```

**3. Using the wrong modulus**

The answer to the problem is a number modulo 10^9 + 7. However, some developers might mistakenly use the wrong modulus, such as 10^9. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**4. Not handling overflow**

The answer to the problem can be very large, so it is important to handle overflow. One way to do this is to use the `long long` data type.

**5. Not using memoization**

The dynamic programming algorithm for finding the maximum f(p) can be very inefficient if it is not memoized. Memoization is a technique that stores the results of subproblems so that they do not have to be recomputed. This can significantly speed up the algorithm.

**6. Not using bitmasks**

Bitmasks can be used to represent permutations efficiently. This can be helpful for reducing the time complexity of the algorithm.

CODEFORCES 1193_A. Amusement Park

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain a slide with the same start and end attraction, or two slides with the same start and end attractions but in different orders.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the output may not be a single integer, or it may not be modulo 998,244,353.

**3. Incorrect solution**

The solution may not be correct. For example, the solution may not find all legal proposals, or it may find some illegal proposals.

**4. Time limit exceeded**

The solution may not be able to finish within the time limit.

**5. Memory limit exceeded**

The solution may not be able to finish within the memory limit.

**6. Incorrect data type**

The solution may use incorrect data types for the input and output. For example, the input may be a string, but the solution may treat it as an integer.

**7. Off-by-one error**

The solution may make an off-by-one error in its calculations. For example, the solution may count the number of legal proposals incorrectly.

**8. Logical error**

The solution may have a logical error. For example, the solution may assume that all slides are directed from the lower attraction to the higher attraction, but this is not always the case.

CODEFORCES 1210_C. Kamil and Making a Stream

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be in the wrong format, or the data type may not be correct. For example, if the input data is a string, but the problem requires an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Off-by-one error**. This is a common mistake that occurs when the programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. For example, if the program is supposed to count the number of elements in an array, but the programmer forgets to increment the counter by one after each iteration, the final count will be one less than the actual number of elements.
3. **Index out of bounds**. This error occurs when the programmer tries to access an element of an array or list that is outside of the bounds of the array or list. For example, if the program is supposed to access the fifth element of an array that only has four elements, the program will crash.
4. **Null pointer exception**. This error occurs when the programmer tries to access a variable that has not been initialized. For example, if the program tries to print the value of a variable that has not been assigned a value, the program will crash.
5. **Arithmetic overflow**. This error occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be represented by the data type of the variable. For example, if the program tries to divide a number by zero, the result will be infinity, which cannot be represented by a signed integer.
6. **Divide by zero error**. This error occurs when the programmer tries to divide a number by zero. The result of dividing a number by zero is undefined, which can cause the program to crash.
7. **Memory leak**. This error occurs when the programmer allocates memory for a variable but does not free the memory when the variable is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
8. **Race condition**. This error occurs when two or more threads try to access the same shared resource at the same time. This can lead to the threads corrupting each other's data or causing the program to crash.
9. **Deadlock**. This error occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, but neither thread is willing to release the resource first. This can lead to the program being stuck in an infinite loop.
10. **Stack overflow**. This error occurs when the program creates too many recursive calls. This can cause the program to run out of stack space and crash.

CODEFORCES 1231_A. Dawid and Bags of Candies

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be four integers separated by spaces, but the developer might accidentally use a different delimiter, such as a comma or a tab. This would cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be either "YES" or "NO", but the developer might accidentally print the answer in all lowercase or all uppercase. This would cause the program to receive a wrong answer on the test cases.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer might use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, they might try to divide the total number of candies by two and then round down to the nearest integer, but this would not work if the total number of candies is not divisible by two.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The developer might accidentally miscalculate the total number of candies or the number of candies each friend should receive. This would cause the program to give the wrong answer on the test cases.
5. **Memory leak**. The developer might accidentally create a memory leak, which would cause the program to use up all of the available memory and eventually crash.
6. **Race condition**. The developer might accidentally create a race condition, which would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
7. **Deadlock**. The developer might accidentally create a deadlock, which would cause the program to stop running and never produce any output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1252_D. Find String in a Grid

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of 2D arrays**

A common mistake when solving this problem is to incorrectly use a 2D array to store the grid. This can lead to errors when trying to access elements of the array, as the indices are not always what you expect. For example, if you try to access the element at row 0 and column 0, you might actually be accessing the element at row 1 and column 0.

To avoid this problem, it is important to carefully consider the dimensions of your 2D array and how you are accessing its elements. You may also want to use a helper function to check that the indices you are using are valid.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

Another common mistake when solving this problem is to make off-by-one errors. This can happen when you are counting the number of occurrences of a string in the grid, or when you are computing the dimensions of the grid.

To avoid this problem, it is important to carefully check your calculations and make sure that you are not missing any elements. You may also want to use a debugger to help you track down any errors.

**3. Incorrect use of string functions**

When working with strings, it is important to use the correct functions. For example, the `substr()` function returns a substring of a string, starting at the specified index and continuing for the specified number of characters. The `strchr()` function returns the first occurrence of a specified character in a string.

If you use the wrong functions, you may get incorrect results. It is important to carefully read the documentation for each function to make sure that you are using it correctly.

**4. Using too much memory**

When solving this problem, it is important to be aware of the amount of memory that your solution uses. If your solution uses too much memory, it may time out or crash.

To avoid this problem, it is important to use efficient data structures and algorithms. You may also want to use a memory profiler to help you identify any areas where your solution is using too much memory.

**5. Incorrect runtime complexity**

When solving this problem, it is important to consider the runtime complexity of your solution. If your solution has a high runtime complexity, it may not be able to solve large inputs in a reasonable amount of time.

To avoid this problem, it is important to use efficient algorithms and data structures. You may also want to use a complexity analyzer to help you identify any areas where your solution can be improved.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1295_D. Same GCDs

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. For example, 10 % 3 is 1, because 10 / 3 has a remainder of 1. However, many people mistakenly use the modulo operator to check if a number is divisible by another number. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
if (n % m == 0):
    print("Divisible")
else:
    print("Not divisible")
```

This code will print "Divisible" for any number n, even if n is not divisible by m. The correct way to check if a number is divisible by another number is to use the bitwise AND operator (&). For example, the following code will work correctly:

```
if (n & (m - 1) == 0):
    print("Divisible")
else:
    print("Not divisible")
```

2. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a developer forgets to account for the first or last element in a range. For example, the following code will not print all of the numbers from 1 to 10:

```
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
```

This code will only print the numbers from 2 to 10, because the range function excludes the last element. The correct way to print all of the numbers from 1 to 10 is to use the following code:

```
for i in range(1, 11 + 1):
    print(i)
```

3. **Incorrect use of variables.** It is important to use variables correctly in order to avoid bugs. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
a = 10
b = 20
c = a + b
print(c)
```

This code will print the value of `a`, which is 10. The correct way to print the sum of `a` and `b` is to use the following code:

```
a = 10
b = 20
c = a + b
print(c)
```

4. **Incorrect use of functions.** It is important to use functions correctly in order to avoid bugs. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
def sum(a, b):
    return a + b

a = 10
b = 20
c = sum(a, b)
print(c)
```

This code will print the value of `a`, which is 10. The correct way to use the `sum()` function is to use the following code:

```
a = 10
b = 20
c = sum(a, b)
print(c)
```

5. **Uninitialized variables.** It is important to initialize variables before using them in your code. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
a = b + c
print(a)
```

This code will throw an error because the variables `b` and `c` are not initialized. The correct way to initialize variables is to use the following code:

```
a = 0
b = 10
c = 20
a = b + c
print(a)
```

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* **Test your code thoroughly:** Make sure to test your code with a variety of input data. This will help you to identify any errors in your code.
* **Use a debugger:** A debugger can help you to identify errors in your code. This can be helpful if you are not sure why your code is not working correctly.
* **Read the problem statement carefully:** Make sure that you understand the problem statement before you start coding. This will help you to avoid making mistakes.
* **Use the resources available to you:** There are many resources available to help you learn how to code. These resources can be helpful if you are stuck on a problem.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid the most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 135_D. Cycle

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` lines of `m` characters each. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash. For example, if the input contains only one integer, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer, which is the length of the longest cool cycle in the table. If there are no cool cycles in the table, the output should be `0`. If the output format is incorrect, the program will crash. For example, if the output contains two integers, the program will crash.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic for finding the longest cool cycle in the table is fairly complex. There are a few ways to go about it, but the most common way is to use a depth-first search algorithm. This algorithm starts at a random cell in the table and explores all of the cells that are reachable from that cell. If a cell is reachable from the starting cell, it is added to a stack. The algorithm continues to explore cells until it reaches a cell that has already been visited or a cell that is not part of the cycle. If the algorithm reaches a cell that has already been visited, it backtracks to the previous cell and tries to find a new path to the starting cell. If the algorithm reaches a cell that is not part of the cycle, it returns the length of the cycle.

There are a few ways to go wrong with the logic for finding the longest cool cycle in the table. One common mistake is to miss a cell that is part of the cycle. This can happen if the algorithm does not explore all of the cells that are reachable from the starting cell. Another common mistake is to include a cell that is not part of the cycle in the cycle. This can happen if the algorithm backtracks to a cell that is not part of the cycle.

**4. Incorrect implementation**

The implementation of the logic for finding the longest cool cycle in the table is also fairly complex. There are a few ways to go wrong with the implementation. One common mistake is to use the wrong data structures. For example, if the algorithm uses a stack to store the cells that are being explored, it is possible that the stack will overflow. Another common mistake is to use the wrong algorithms. For example, if the algorithm uses a breadth-first search algorithm to explore the cells in the table, it is possible that the algorithm will not find the longest cool cycle.

**5. Incorrect testing**

The testing for this problem should be comprehensive. The test cases should cover all of the possible input formats and all of the possible logic errors. The test cases should also be designed to catch any bugs that may be introduced in the implementation.

**6. Incorrect debugging**

If the program crashes or produces incorrect output, it can be difficult to debug. The debugger can be used to help identify the source of the problem. The debugger can also be used to track the execution of the program and to identify the values of variables at different points in the program.

Title:
CODEFORCES 137_E. Last Chance

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input string may not be in the correct format. For example, it may contain non-Latin characters or it may be empty.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be two numbers separated by a space.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the longest good substring**. The longest good substring may not be the one with the maximum length. For example, if the input string is "aeiou", the longest good substring is "aeiou", but it has the same length as "eiou".
4. **Incorrect counting of the number of good substrings**. Two substrings are considered different if their positions of occurrence are different. So if some string occurs more than once, then it should be counted more than once.
5. **Other bugs**. There may be other bugs in the code, such as incorrect handling of errors, incorrect memory management, etc.

Title:
CODEFORCES 13_E. Holes

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always followed correctly. For example, the input may contain non-integer values, or the number of holes may be negative. The developer should check the input format and handle errors accordingly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always followed correctly. For example, the output may contain incorrect values, or the number of lines may be incorrect. The developer should check the output format and handle errors accordingly.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program. For example, the developer may not correctly calculate the number of jumps the ball makes, or the developer may not correctly update the power of the holes. The developer should carefully check the logic of the program to ensure that it is correct.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer may not correctly free up memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to memory leaks, which can eventually cause the program to crash. The developer should carefully manage memory to avoid memory leaks.
5. **Synchronization issues**. The developer may not correctly synchronize access to shared resources. This can lead to race conditions, which can cause the program to behave incorrectly. The developer should carefully synchronize access to shared resources to avoid race conditions.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer may not correctly protect the program from security vulnerabilities. This can allow attackers to exploit the program to gain unauthorized access to the system. The developer should carefully protect the program from security vulnerabilities.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1423_N. BubbleSquare Tokens

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain two integers `n` and `k`, but the input may contain a different number of integers.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the first line should contain the number of members who are keeping their personal token, and the second line should contain a space-separated list of those members. However, the output may not be in the correct format.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of tokens each member receives.** The problem states that each member receives one personal token and two additional tokens for each friend they have. However, the code may incorrectly calculate the number of tokens each member receives.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the number of tokens each friend pair receives.** The problem states that each friend pair may agree to each return one or two tokens they have obtained on behalf of their friendship. However, the code may incorrectly calculate the number of tokens each friend pair receives.
5. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem specifies that `n` must be at least 2 and `k` must be at least 1. However, the code may not handle these edge cases correctly.
6. **Incorrect error handling.** The problem may contain errors, such as invalid input or malformed output. The code should handle these errors gracefully.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1444_A. Division

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specified in the problem statement is `t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) — the number of pairs.`. However, a developer may accidentally use a different input format, such as `t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50)`, which would cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specified in the problem statement is `t integers: the i-th integer is the largest x_i such that p_i is divisible by x_i, but x_i is not divisible by q_i.`. However, a developer may accidentally output the values in a different order, such as `x_1, x_2, ..., x_t`, which would cause the program to receive a incorrect verdict.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, a developer may use a brute-force algorithm that iterates over all possible values of `x_i`, which would be very inefficient.
4. **Incorrect error handling**. The program may not handle errors correctly. For example, the program may not handle invalid input values or it may crash if an error occurs.
5. **Incorrect test cases**. The program may not be tested thoroughly, which could lead to errors being missed.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to develop a correct algorithm and to test the program thoroughly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1545_B. AquaMoon and Chess

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modular arithmetic.** When calculating the final answer, it is important to make sure that all intermediate calculations are done modulo 998244353, and that the final answer is also reduced modulo 998244353. For example, the following code would produce the wrong answer:

```
def solve(n, s):
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if s[i] == '1':
                dp[i + 1][j + 2] += dp[i][j]
                dp[i + 1][j - 2] += dp[i][j]
    return dp[n][n] % 998244353
```

The problem is that the calculation `dp[i + 1][j + 2] += dp[i][j]` does not take into account the fact that the answer should be reduced modulo 998244353. To fix this, we can add the following line to the code:

```
dp[i + 1][j + 2] %= 998244353
```

2. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over arrays or lists, it is important to make sure that you do not accidentally go off the end of the array. For example, the following code would produce the wrong answer:

```
def solve(n, s):
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if s[i] == '1':
                dp[i + 1][j + 2] += dp[i][j]
                dp[i + 1][j - 2] += dp[i][j]
    return dp[n][n]
```

The problem is that the loop over `j` goes from `0` to `n`, but the array `dp` is only indexed from `1` to `n`. To fix this, we can change the loop to start at `1` instead of `0`:

```
def solve(n, s):
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if s[i] == '1':
                dp[i + 1][j + 2] += dp[i][j]
                dp[i + 1][j - 2] += dp[i][j]
    return dp[n][n]
```

3. **Incorrect use of memoization.** Memoization is a technique that can be used to speed up recursive algorithms by storing the results of intermediate calculations in a table. However, it is important to make sure that the table is initialized correctly. For example, the following code would produce the wrong answer:

```
def solve(n, s):
    dp = [[-1] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    return dfs(n, s, 0, 0, dp)

def dfs(n, s, i, j, dp):
    if i >= n or j >= n:
        return 0
    if dp[i][j] != -1:
        return dp[i][j]
    if s[i] == '1':
        dp[i][j] = dfs(n, s, i + 1, j + 2, dp) + dfs(n, s, i + 1, j - 2, dp)
    else:
        dp[i][j] = dfs(n, s, i + 1, j, dp) + dfs(n, s, i + 1, j + 1, dp) + dfs(n,

Title:
CODEFORCES 172_A. Phone Code

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data contains strings, so we need to use a string data type to store them. If we use the wrong data type, such as an integer, we will get a compilation error.

**2. Not using the same data type for all variables**

In this problem, we need to compare strings. If we use different data types for the strings, we will get a compilation error.

**3. Using the wrong comparison operator**

We need to use the `==` operator to compare strings. If we use the `==` operator, we will get the wrong answer.

**4. Not handling the edge cases**

The input data may contain empty strings. We need to handle this case in our code.

**5. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

We can use the [Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm) to find the longest common substring of a set of strings. This algorithm is much more efficient than a brute-force approach.

Title:
CODEFORCES 192_B. Walking in the Rain

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is "4 10 3 5 10", the program will incorrectly parse the input as "4 10 3 5 10 10", which will lead to an incorrect answer.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic of the program may be incorrect, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may incorrectly check whether a tile is destroyed, or it may incorrectly calculate the number of days that the walk is possible.
* **Off-by-one errors:** The program may make off-by-one errors, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may incorrectly calculate the number of days that the walk is possible by forgetting to add one to the result.
* **Memory errors:** The program may run out of memory, which can lead to incorrect results or a crash. For example, the program may create an array that is too large, or it may recursively call a function too many times.
* **Time errors:** The program may take too long to run, which can lead to a timeout. For example, the program may use a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem, or it may use an inefficient data structure.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and to carefully design and implement the program. It is also important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it produces correct results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 216_B. Forming Teams

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type for the number of students or the number of pairs of archenemies.**

The input specifies that the number of students and the number of pairs of archenemies should be integers between 2 and 100. If you accidentally use a data type that is too small to store these values, your program will crash.

**2. Not handling the case where a student has more than two archenemies.**

The problem statement specifies that each student has at most two archenemies. If you accidentally try to create a team that contains a student with more than two archenemies, your program will crash.

**3. Not handling the case where there are no two students who are not archenemies.**

The problem statement specifies that the students want to split so that no two archenemies are in the same team. If there are no two students who are not archenemies, then it is impossible to form two teams that satisfy this requirement. In this case, your program should print the maximum number of students that can be on a team.

**4. Not handling the case where the input is malformed.**

The input may be malformed in a number of ways. For example, it may contain a line that does not contain two integers, or it may contain two integers that are not between 1 and n. If you do not handle these cases correctly, your program will crash.

**5. Using an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem.**

There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. If you use an incorrect algorithm, your program may not find the optimal solution.

**6. Not testing your program thoroughly.**

It is important to test your program thoroughly to make sure that it handles all of the possible cases correctly. This includes testing your program on a variety of different inputs, including inputs that are malformed, inputs that contain incorrect data, and inputs that are just plain difficult.

Title:
CODEFORCES 336_B. Vasily the Bear and Fly

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect calculation of the distance between two circles**

The distance between two circles is not simply the sum of their radii. The correct formula is

```
d = sqrt(2*r^2 - (r^2 - d^2)^2)
```

where `d` is the distance between the centers of the circles and `r` is the radius of each circle.

**2. Using the wrong coordinate system**

The problem specifies that the circles are centered at points `(2R - R, 0)` and `(2R - R, 2R)`. However, many people are used to thinking of circles as being centered at the origin. This can lead to errors when calculating the distance between two circles.

**3. Using the wrong formula for the area of a circle**

The area of a circle is not simply `πr^2`. The correct formula is

```
A = πr^2 - (πr^2 - d^2)^2/4
```

where `d` is the distance between the centers of the circles and `r` is the radius of each circle.

**4. Not taking into account the fact that the fly may not travel in a straight line**

The problem states that the fly travels along the shortest path with all points lying on the border or inside at least one of the 2m circles. However, this does not mean that the fly will travel in a straight line. The fly may need to travel around one or more of the circles in order to reach its destination.

**5. Not taking into account the fact that the fly may travel multiple times between the same two circles**

The problem states that the fly travels from the center of circle v to the center of circle u. However, the fly may travel between the same two circles multiple times during the experiment. This means that the total distance traveled by the fly will be greater than the distance between the two circles.

**6. Not taking into account the fact that the fly may not travel between all of the circles**

The problem states that the fly travels from the center of circle v to the center of circle u. However, the fly may not travel between all of the circles during the experiment. This means that the total distance traveled by the fly will be less than the distance between all of the circles.

**7. Not taking into account the fact that the fly may not travel on the same day as it arrived**

The problem states that the fly arrives at the coordinate plane at the center of the circle with number `v`. However, the fly may not travel from the center of circle v to the center of circle u on the same day as it arrived. This means that the total distance traveled by the fly will be less than the distance between the two circles.

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the Euclidean algorithm.** The Euclidean algorithm is a recursive algorithm that finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. A common mistake is to implement the algorithm incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect handling of negative numbers.** The Euclidean algorithm can be used to find the GCD of two negative numbers, but it is important to handle these numbers correctly. A common mistake is to treat negative numbers as positive numbers, which can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect handling of zero.** The Euclidean algorithm cannot be used to find the GCD of zero and any other number. A common mistake is to try to use the Euclidean algorithm on zero and another number, which will lead to an error.
4. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The Euclidean algorithm can be used to find the GCD of very large numbers, but it is important to handle overflow correctly. A common mistake is to perform arithmetic operations on very large numbers without checking for overflow, which can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic.** The Euclidean algorithm uses modulo arithmetic to find the GCD of two numbers. A common mistake is to use modulo arithmetic incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect results.

**Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:**

1. **Use a verified implementation of the Euclidean algorithm.** There are many verified implementations of the Euclidean algorithm available online. Using a verified implementation can help you avoid implementing the algorithm incorrectly.
2. **Be careful when handling negative numbers.** The Euclidean algorithm can be used to find the GCD of two negative numbers, but it is important to handle these numbers correctly. Make sure to treat negative numbers as negative numbers, and not as positive numbers.
3. **Be careful when handling zero.** The Euclidean algorithm cannot be used to find the GCD of zero and any other number. Make sure to check for zero before calling the Euclidean algorithm.
4. **Be careful when handling overflow.** The Euclidean algorithm can be used to find the GCD of very large numbers, but it is important to handle overflow correctly. Make sure to check for overflow before performing arithmetic operations on very large numbers.
5. **Use modulo arithmetic correctly.** The Euclidean algorithm uses modulo arithmetic to find the GCD of two numbers. Make sure to use modulo arithmetic correctly, and to understand the implications of using modulo arithmetic.

2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong data type. For example, the number of vertices may be a string instead of an integer. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one error**. When iterating through the data, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one or more items. This can lead to the program producing incorrect output.
4. **Index out of bounds error**. When accessing data in an array or other data structure, it is possible to access an index that is out of bounds. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
5. **Memory leak**. The program may not properly release memory that it has allocated. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race condition**. When multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is possible for them to interfere with each other and produce incorrect results.
7. **Deadlock**. When multiple threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, it is possible for them to get stuck in a deadlock where no thread can progress.
8. **Buffer overflow**. When a buffer is not large enough to hold the data that is being written to it, the data can overwrite adjacent memory locations. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
9. **Format string vulnerability**. A format string vulnerability occurs when a program uses a format string that is not properly sanitized. This can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the program, which can lead to the program being compromised.
10. **SQL injection vulnerability**. A SQL injection vulnerability occurs when a program uses user input in a SQL query without properly sanitizing it. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database, which can lead to the database being compromised.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when printing the output. For example, if the output contains a character that is not a digit, the program will crash.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic of the program is the most important part, and it is easy to make a mistake here. For example, if the program does not correctly check for three or more contiguous balls of the same color, it will not give the correct answer.

**4. Runtime errors**

The program may also crash due to runtime errors. For example, if the program tries to access a memory location that does not exist, it will crash.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always followed correctly, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values may not be correct, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program may crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are common when programming, and they can lead to incorrect results. For example, if a program is supposed to find the minimum distance between two elements in an array, but it starts the search at the wrong index, the program will find the wrong answer.
4. **Index out of bounds errors**. Index out of bounds errors occur when a program tries to access an element of an array that does not exist. For example, if a program tries to access the element at index 100 of an array that only has 10 elements, the program will crash.
5. **Infinite loops**. Infinite loops occur when a program enters a loop that never terminates. For example, if a program is supposed to print the numbers from 1 to 10, but it does not have a way to break out of the loop, the program will print the numbers forever.
6. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
7. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more parts of a program try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
8. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more parts of a program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish because it is waiting for the other one. This can lead to the program freezing or crashing.
9. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can occur when a program does not properly protect its data. This can allow attackers to access sensitive data or take control of the program.
10. **Performance problems**. Performance problems can occur when a program is not written efficiently. This can lead to the program running slowly or using too much memory.

CODEFORCES 575_H. Bots

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect calculation of the number of states**

The most common mistake when solving this problem is to incorrectly calculate the number of states. A common mistake is to only consider the states where both bots have made exactly N moves. However, it is also important to consider the states where one bot has made more than N moves.

For example, consider the following game state:

```
[R1, R2, B1, B2]
```

In this state, the red bot has made 2 moves and the blue bot has made 1 move. Since both bots have not made exactly N moves, this state is not counted when calculating the number of states.

However, this state is still important to consider because it can lead to other states where both bots have made exactly N moves. For example, if the red bot makes another move, the game state will become:

```
[R3, R2, B1, B2]
```

In this state, both bots have made exactly N moves. Therefore, this state must be counted when calculating the number of states.

**2. Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic**

Another common mistake when solving this problem is to incorrectly use modulo arithmetic. Modulo arithmetic is used to ensure that the number of states is a finite number. However, it is important to use modulo arithmetic correctly to avoid errors.

For example, consider the following code:

```
def count_states(n):
  """Counts the number of states where both bots have made exactly N moves."""

  states = 0
  for i in range(n + 1):
    for j in range(n + 1):
      states += (i * j) % 10**9 + 7

  return states
```

This code is incorrect because it does not correctly use modulo arithmetic. The expression `(i * j) % 10**9 + 7` will overflow if `i * j` is greater than `10**9`. This can lead to incorrect results.

To correctly use modulo arithmetic, we can use the following code:

```
def count_states(n):
  """Counts the number of states where both bots have made exactly N moves."""

  states = 0
  for i in range(n + 1):
    for j in range(n + 1):
      states += (i * j) % (10**9 + 7)

  return states
```

This code correctly uses modulo arithmetic to ensure that the number of states is a finite number.

**3. Incorrect handling of overflow**

Another common mistake when solving this problem is to incorrectly handle overflow. Overflow occurs when a numerical value is too large to be represented by a computer. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following code:

```
def count_states(n):
  """Counts the number of states where both bots have made exactly N moves."""

  states = 0
  for i in range(n + 1):
    for j in range(n + 1):
      states += (i * j)

  return states
```

This code is incorrect because it does not correctly handle overflow. The expression `(i * j)` can overflow if `i` and `j` are large enough. This can lead to incorrect results.

To correctly handle overflow, we can use the following code:

```
def count_states(n):
  """Counts the number of states where both bots have made exactly N moves."""

  states = 0
  for i in range(n + 1):
    for j in range(n + 1):
      states += (i * j) // (10**9 + 7)

  return states
```

This code correctly handles overflow by dividing the product of `i` and `j` by `10**9 + 7`. This ensures that the result is always a finite number.

CODEFORCES 598_C. Nearest vectors

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line of the input should contain a single integer n, which is the number of vectors. However, if the input format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the program should print two integer numbers a and b, which are the indices of the vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle. However, if the output format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the non-oriented angle.** The non-oriented angle between two vectors is the angle between their tails and heads. However, if the program incorrectly calculates the non-oriented angle, it may produce incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect choice of the two vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle.** The program should find the two vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle. However, if the program incorrectly chooses the two vectors, it may produce incorrect output.
5. **Incorrect handling of ties.** There may be multiple pairs of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle. The program should print any one of these pairs. However, if the program incorrectly handles ties, it may produce incorrect output.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the input and output formats, and to correctly calculate the non-oriented angle and choose the two vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle. It is also important to handle ties correctly.

CODEFORCES 849_D. Rooter's Song

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect data type:** The input data is given in the form of space-separated integers. However, if the developer does not properly parse the input data, they may end up with incorrect data types, which can lead to errors in the program.
* **Off-by-one errors:** The problem statement mentions that the stage is of size w × h, where w and h are positive integers. However, if the developer does not properly initialize the stage dimensions, they may end up with an off-by-one error, which can lead to incorrect results.
* **Collision detection:** The problem statement mentions that dancers collide when they are on the same point at some time when both of them are moving. However, if the developer does not properly implement the collision detection algorithm, they may end up with incorrect results.
* **Incorrect output format:** The problem statement specifies that the output should be in the form of two space-separated integers, representing the stopping position of the dancer. However, if the developer does not properly format the output, they may end up with incorrect results.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

* **Be careful when parsing the input data.** Make sure to properly parse the input data into the correct data types.
* **Double-check your calculations.** Make sure to carefully check your calculations to avoid off-by-one errors.
* **Test your code thoroughly.** Test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct.
* **Use a debugger to help you find errors.** If you are having trouble finding a bug, use a debugger to help you track down the problem.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer q, which is the number of queries. However, if the input contains more than one integer on the first line, or if the first integer is not a positive integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that each line of output should contain a single integer, which is the maximum possible number of summands in a valid splitting of the corresponding input integer. However, if the output contains more than one integer on a line, or if the output integer is not a positive integer, the program will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program should first check if the input integer is prime. If it is prime, the program should output -1. Otherwise, the program should find all of the prime factors of the input integer and output the maximum number of summands that can be formed by using these prime factors. However, if the program does not correctly find all of the prime factors of the input integer, or if it incorrectly calculates the maximum number of summands, the program will be incorrect.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program should be careful not to allocate any memory that it does not need. If the program allocates too much memory, it may crash or run out of memory.
5. **Time complexity**. The program should run in time O(n log n), where n is the number of input integers. If the program runs in more time than this, it will be too slow for large inputs.

3. **Incorrect calculation of the k-th smallest perfect integer**. The k-th smallest perfect integer is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all of the integers from 1 to k. However, the developer may incorrectly calculate the k-th smallest perfect integer by using a different method.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer may not properly release memory that is allocated during the execution of the program. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
5. **Race conditions**. The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data between multiple threads. This can lead to a race condition, which can cause the program to produce incorrect results or to crash.
6. **Deadlocks**. The developer may not properly handle deadlocks between multiple threads. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer may not properly protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. This can lead to a security vulnerability, which can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system.

Title:
CODEFORCES 946_A. Partition

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the input/output.** The input and output of this problem are both integers. If you use the wrong data type, such as strings, you will get a compiler error.
2. **Not initializing the variables correctly.** When you declare a variable, you need to initialize it with a value. For example, if you declare a variable `sum` to store the sum of the numbers in the input, you need to initialize it with the value `0`. Otherwise, the value of `sum` will be undefined, and you will get a runtime error.
3. **Using the wrong algorithm.** The optimal solution to this problem is to sort the numbers in the input in ascending order, and then divide them into two groups such that the absolute value of the difference between the sums of the two groups is maximized. If you use a suboptimal algorithm, you will not get the correct answer.
4. **Making a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm.** Even if you use the correct algorithm, you can still make a mistake in the implementation. For example, you might forget to add a boundary check to a loop, or you might use the wrong variable in an expression. These types of mistakes can cause your program to crash or to produce incorrect output.
5. **Not handling special cases correctly.** The input to this problem may contain special cases, such as all the numbers being equal or all the numbers being negative. If you do not handle these special cases correctly, you will not get the correct answer.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand the problem. You should also carefully design your algorithm and implement it correctly. Finally, you should test your program thoroughly to make sure that it produces the correct output for all possible inputs.

CODEFORCES 96_D. Volleyball

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format of the problem is very specific. Make sure that you read the input correctly and parse it into the correct data structures.
2. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm you use to solve the problem may be incorrect. Make sure that you understand the problem and that your algorithm is correct.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** These are common mistakes that can occur when you are coding. Make sure that you check your code carefully for off-by-one errors.
4. **Memory leaks.** Make sure that you free any memory that you allocate during your program. Memory leaks can cause your program to crash or run out of memory.
5. **Synchronization errors.** If your program is multi-threaded, make sure that you synchronize your access to shared data. Synchronization errors can cause your program to produce incorrect results or crash.
6. **Race conditions.** Race conditions can occur when multiple threads try to access the same data at the same time. Race conditions can cause your program to produce incorrect results or crash.
7. **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. Deadlocks can cause your program to hang or crash.
8. **Buffer overflows.** Buffer overflows can occur when you write more data to a buffer than it can hold. Buffer overflows can cause your program to crash or execute arbitrary code.
9. **Format string vulnerabilities.** Format string vulnerabilities can occur when you use the `printf()` or `sprintf()` functions incorrectly. Format string vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on your system.
10. **SQL injection vulnerabilities.** SQL injection vulnerabilities can occur when you use the `mysql_query()` or `mysqli_query()` functions incorrectly. SQL injection vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL statements on your database.

Title:
CODEFORCES 994_D. Open Communication

Pain points:
**1. Input Format**

The first line contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 12) — the number of pairs the first participant communicated to the second and vice versa.

The second line contains `n` pairs of integers, each between 1 and 9, — pairs of numbers communicated from first participant to the second.

The third line contains `m` pairs of integers, each between 1 and 9, — pairs of numbers communicated from the second participant to the first.

All pairs within each set are distinct (in particular, if there is a pair (1,2), there will be no pair (2,1) within the same set), and no pair contains the same number twice.

It is guaranteed that the two sets do not contradict the statements, in other words, there is pair from the first set and a pair from the second set that share exactly one number.

**2. Output Format**

If you can deduce the shared number with certainty, print that number.

If you can with certainty deduce that both participants know the shared number, but you do not know it, print 0.

Otherwise print -1.

**3. Examples**

**Example 1**

```
Input:
2 2
1 2 3 4
1 5 3 4

Output:
1
```

**Explanation:**

In the first example the first participant communicated pairs (1,2) and (3,4), and the second communicated (1,5), (3,4). Since we know that the actual pairs they received share exactly one number, it can't be that they both have (3,4). Thus, the first participant has (1,2) and the second has (1,5), and at this point you already know the shared number is 1.

**Example 2**

```
Input:
2 2
1 2 3 4
1 5 6 4

Output:
0
```

**Explanation:**

In the second example either the first participant has (1,2) and the second has (1,5), or the first has (3,4) and the second has (6,4). In the first case both of them know the shared number is 1, in the second case both of them know the shared number is 4. You don't have enough information to tell 1 and 4 apart.

**Example 3**

```
Input:
2 3
1 2 4 5
1 2 1 3 2 3

Output:
-1
```

**Explanation:**

In the third case if the first participant was given (1,2), they don't know what the shared number is, since from their perspective the second participant might have been given either (1,3), in which case the shared number is 1, or (2,3), in which case the shared number is 2. While the second participant does know the number with certainty, neither you nor the first participant do, so the output is -1.

**4. Possible Bugs**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correct. For example, the first line does not contain two integers `n` and `m`.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correct. For example, the output is not an integer.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic is incorrect. For example, the program does not output the correct answer.
* **Memory leak:** The program leaks memory. For example, the program does not free the memory that it allocated.
* **Time complexity:** The program has a high time complexity. For example, the program takes a long time to run.

Title:
HACKEREARTH chotu-and-distinct-elements

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The variable `n` should be an integer, but it is defined as a string. This will cause a type error.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator:** The comparison operator `>` is used to compare two integers, but it is used to compare two strings in the code. This will cause a logic error.
3. **Incorrect data type:** The variable `love_factor` is defined as an integer, but it is assigned a string value. This will cause a type error.
4. **Off-by-one error:** The code iterates over the array of roses one element too many, which results in an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect logic:** The code does not take into account the fact that the roses must be arranged in a specific order. This results in an incorrect answer.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the variable types, comparison operators, data types, and logic of the code. They should also test the code with a variety of input values to ensure that it produces the correct output.

Pain points:
### Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect implementation of the formula.** The formula for computing the next key is quite complex, and it is easy to make a mistake when implementing it. For example, it is important to remember that the modulo operation must be performed after the summation, and not before.
* **Incorrect handling of negative indices.** The formula for computing the next key involves summing terms with negative indices. It is important to handle these terms correctly, otherwise the results will be incorrect.
* **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The formula for computing the next key can potentially overflow if the sum of the terms is too large. It is important to handle this case correctly, otherwise the results will be incorrect.
* **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator is used to ensure that the results of the computation are always within the range of valid keys. It is important to use the modulo operator correctly, otherwise the results will be incorrect.
* **Incorrect use of the array indices.** The array indices in the formula for computing the next key are not always consecutive. It is important to use the correct indices, otherwise the results will be incorrect.
* **Incorrect use of the data types.** The data types used in the formula for computing the next key must be large enough to represent the values of the keys. It is important to use the correct data types, otherwise the results will be incorrect.

### How to avoid these problems and bugs

To avoid these problems and bugs, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements. It is also important to carefully implement the formula for computing the next key, and to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct.

Title:
ATCODER p02636 AtCoder Grand Contest 046 - Secret Passage

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulo operation.** When calculating the final answer, it is important to remember to perform the modulo operation at each step. For example, if the current answer is `12345` and the next step multiplies it by `6789`, the final answer should be `(12345 * 6789) % 998244353` instead of `12345 * 6789`.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When counting the number of possible strings, it is important to make sure that you are not counting the same string multiple times. For example, if you are counting the number of strings that can be formed by removing the first two characters from a string of length `n`, you should not count the string `01` twice, once for when the first character is removed and once for when the second character is removed.
3. **Incorrect use of bitmasks.** Bitmasks can be a powerful tool for solving problems involving strings, but it is important to use them correctly. For example, if you are using a bitmask to represent the characters in a string, you should make sure that you set the bits corresponding to the characters that are present in the string and clear the bits corresponding to the characters that are not present.
4. **Incorrect use of dynamic programming.** Dynamic programming can be a very efficient way to solve problems involving strings, but it is important to make sure that you set up the dynamic programming table correctly. For example, if you are using a dynamic programming table to store the number of strings that can be formed by a given prefix of the input string, you should make sure that the table is initialized to the correct value for the empty string.
5. **Incorrect use of memoization.** Memoization can be a very efficient way to solve problems involving recursion, but it is important to make sure that you use it correctly. For example, if you are using memoization to store the results of recursive calls, you should make sure that you update the memoization table after each recursive call.

ATCODER p02902 AtCoder Beginner Contest 142 - Pure

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**. The input format is given in the problem statement, but the developer may not have read it carefully and make mistakes when writing the code. For example, the developer may forget to add a space between the two numbers in the first line of the input, or the developer may not use the correct delimiters between the numbers.

**2. The developer may not understand the problem correctly**. The problem is asking for an induced subgraph of the given graph, but the developer may not know what an induced subgraph is. An induced subgraph is a subgraph of a graph that contains all of the edges of the original graph that connect vertices that are both in the subgraph. For example, if the original graph has the edges (1, 2) and (2, 3), then an induced subgraph of the original graph could be the graph with the vertices 1, 2, and 3 and the edges (1, 2) and (2, 3).

**3. The developer may not know how to find an induced subgraph**. There are a few different ways to find an induced subgraph of a graph. One way is to use a depth-first search or a breadth-first search. Another way is to use a greedy algorithm.

**4. The developer may not be able to correctly implement the solution**. Even if the developer understands the problem and knows how to find an induced subgraph, they may still make mistakes when implementing the solution. For example, the developer may forget to check for errors, or the developer may not use the correct data structures.

**5. The developer may not be able to test the solution correctly**. Even if the developer is able to implement the solution correctly, they may still not be able to test the solution correctly. For example, the developer may not test the solution on all possible inputs, or the developer may not test the solution on inputs that are likely to cause problems.

**6. The developer may not be able to debug the solution**. If the developer's solution does not work correctly, they may not be able to debug the solution. For example, the developer may not know how to use a debugger, or the developer may not be able to understand the error messages that are being generated.

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is given as integers. If the developer uses the wrong data type to store the input data, it may cause incorrect results. For example, if the developer uses `int` to store the input data, it may cause an overflow error when the input data is too large.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The developer may use an incorrect algorithm, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may use a brute-force algorithm, which will be very inefficient.

**3. Not handling corner cases**

The problem has some corner cases. For example, if the input data is empty, the developer should return `0`. If the developer does not handle corner cases correctly, it may lead to incorrect results.

**4. Using incorrect logic**

The developer may make mistakes in the logic of the program. For example, the developer may forget to update the state of the program after each iteration. This may lead to incorrect results.

**5. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code thoroughly before submitting it. The developer may miss some bugs if they do not test the code thoroughly.

ATCODER p03178 Educational DP Contest - Digit Sum

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**

When working with large numbers, it is important to use the correct modulo operator. In this problem, the input and output are both modulo 10^9 + 7, so we need to use `% 1000000007` to perform modulo arithmetic.

**2. Using the wrong data type**

The input and output of this problem are both integers, so we need to use the `int` data type to store them. Using a smaller data type, such as `short` or `long`, could lead to incorrect results.

**3. Not handling overflow correctly**

When adding or multiplying large numbers, it is possible for the result to overflow. In this problem, we need to be careful to handle overflow correctly. One way to do this is to use the `long` data type to store intermediate results.

**4. Making a mistake in the algorithm**

The algorithm for solving this problem is relatively simple, but it is still possible to make a mistake. One common mistake is to forget to take into account the fact that the sum of the digits in a number can be greater than the number itself.

**5. Not testing the code**

It is always important to test your code before submitting it. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed. You can test your code by using a variety of different input values.

Title:
ATCODER p03480 AtCoder Beginner Contest 083 - Wide Flip

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input string `S` can contain up to 10^5 characters, so it's important to use a data type that can store that many characters. A `char` array is not large enough, so you should use a `string` or a `vector<char>` instead.

**2. Not handling the case where `S` is all 0s or all 1s**

The problem statement says that we can turn all the characters of `S` into `0` by repeating the operation some number of times. However, if `S` is all 0s or all 1s, then we can't turn any of the characters into the other value. In this case, the maximum value of `K` is 0.

**3. Not handling the case where `S` contains both 0s and 1s**

If `S` contains both 0s and 1s, then we can turn all the characters into `0` by repeating the operation some number of times. The maximum value of `K` is the length of the longest contiguous substring of `S` that contains all 0s or all 1s.

**4. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The most efficient algorithm for finding the longest contiguous substring of `S` that contains all 0s or all 1s is the Kadane's algorithm. This algorithm runs in O(N) time, where `N` is the length of `S`.

**5. Not handling the corner cases**

There are a few corner cases that you need to be aware of when solving this problem. For example, if `S` is empty, then the maximum value of `K` is 0. Additionally, if `S` contains only one character, then the maximum value of `K` is 1.

Title:
ATCODER p03647 AtCoder Regular Contest 079 - Cat Snuke and a Voyage

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type**

The input specifies that `N` and `M` are integers, but the developer may accidentally use a floating-point type. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a simple depth-first search algorithm. However, the developer may accidentally use a different algorithm, such as a breadth-first search algorithm. This would cause the program to run slower or produce incorrect results.

**3. Not handling corner cases**

The problem specifies several corner cases, such as the case where there is no boat service from Island 1 to Island N. The developer must make sure to handle these corner cases correctly, or the program will produce incorrect results.

**4. Using incorrect variable names**

The problem specifies the names of the variables that should be used, such as `N`, `M`, `a_i`, and `b_i`. The developer must make sure to use the correct variable names, or the program will not compile or produce incorrect results.

**5. Forgetting to check for errors**

The program should check for errors, such as invalid input or memory allocation errors. If the program does not check for errors, it may crash or produce incorrect results.

ATCODER p03803 AtCoder Beginner Contest 054 - One Card Poker

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect comparison**. The comparison between two integers should be done with `<`, `>`, `<=`, or `>=`. For example, `if (A > B)` is incorrect.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The programmer may forget to add or subtract 1 when comparing two integers. For example, `if (A == B + 1)` is incorrect.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The programmer may make a mistake in the logic of the program. For example, the programmer may forget to check for a tie.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The programmer may not output the correct format for the answer. For example, the programmer may print `Alice` instead of `Alice`.
5. **Runtime error**. The programmer may make a mistake that causes the program to crash. For example, the programmer may try to divide by zero.
6. **Memory leak**. The programmer may not free up memory that is no longer needed. This can eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
7. **Security vulnerability**. The programmer may make a mistake that allows an attacker to exploit the program. For example, the programmer may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

Title:
ATCODER p03971 CODE FESTIVAL 2016 qual B - Qualification simulator

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The problem states that `N, A, B` are integers, but the solution code defines them as strings. This will cause a type error.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator.** The problem states that a Japanese student passes the Qualification contests if the number of the participants who have already definitively passed is currently fewer than `A+B`, but the solution code compares `A+B` to `A`. This will always return `True`.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The problem states that an overseas student passes the Qualification contests if the number of the participants who have already definitively passed is currently fewer than `A+B` and the student ranks `B-th` or above among all overseas students. However, the solution code only checks if the student ranks `B-th` or above, without checking if the number of participants who have already definitively passed is fewer than `A+B`. This will cause some overseas students to be incorrectly classified as passing the Qualification contests.
4. **Off-by-one error.** The problem states that the output should be a list of `N` lines, but the solution code only outputs `N-1` lines. This will cause the last line of output to be missing.
5. **Incorrect indentation.** The solution code is not properly indented, which makes it difficult to read and debug.

To avoid these problems, be sure to carefully read the problem statement and understand the constraints. Then, carefully write your code, paying attention to the types of your variables and the correctness of your logic. Finally, test your code thoroughly to make sure that it produces the correct output.

Title:
AIZU p00542 Selecting Subjects

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable names**

When writing code, it is important to use descriptive variable names that clearly indicate what the variable is used for. In this problem, the variables `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, and `F` are used to store the scores for physics, chemistry, biology, earth science, history, and geography, respectively. However, these variable names are not very descriptive and could be easily misinterpreted. For example, someone might think that `A` is the score for history, when it is actually the score for physics.

To avoid this confusion, it would be better to use variable names like `physics_score`, `chemistry_score`, `biology_score`, `earth_science_score`, `history_score`, and `geography_score`. This would make it much clearer what each variable is used for.

2. **Incorrect data types**

Another common mistake that developers make when solving problems is using the wrong data types. In this problem, the scores for each subject are given as integers. However, the total score for the tests of the selected subject could be greater than 100. Therefore, it is important to use a data type that can store numbers greater than 100, such as a `long`.

3. **Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a developer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. In this problem, the developer might forget to increment the variable `i` by one when looping through the scores. This would result in the developer skipping one of the scores, which would lead to an incorrect answer.

To avoid this error, it is important to be careful when incrementing or decrementing variables. It is also helpful to use a debugger to step through the code and make sure that the variables are being incremented or decremented correctly.

4. **Incorrect logic**

Another common mistake that developers make when solving problems is using incorrect logic. In this problem, the developer might incorrectly assume that the total score for the tests of the selected subject is always the sum of the scores for the four subjects of physics, chemistry, biology, and earth science. However, this is not always the case. For example, if the scores for physics, chemistry, biology, and earth science are 100, 34, 76, and 42, respectively, then the total score for the tests of the selected subject is 252. This is because the developer forgot to include the score for history.

To avoid this error, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand the problem. It is also helpful to draw a diagram or write out the steps of the solution before you start coding.

5. **Uncaught exceptions**

Uncaught exceptions are a type of bug that occurs when a program encounters an error that it cannot handle. In this problem, the developer might encounter an uncaught exception if they try to divide by zero. This could happen if the score for one of the subjects is zero.

To avoid this error, it is important to check for errors before performing any operations that could cause an exception. For example, the developer could check if the score for a subject is zero before dividing by it.

6. **Incorrect formatting**

Incorrect formatting can make it difficult for other developers to read and understand your code. In this problem, the developer might incorrectly format the output. This could make it difficult for other developers to understand what the output means.

To avoid this error, it is important to follow the correct formatting conventions for your programming language. For example, in Python, the output should be formatted as follows:

```

Title:
AIZU p01724 Phutball

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input may not be in the correct format.
* The input may contain invalid characters.
* The input may not be a valid board state.
* The output may not be in the correct format.
* The output may not be the shortest possible number of jumps.

Here are some specific examples of problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer may not correctly parse the input. This could lead to errors such as incorrect board states or invalid characters being included in the output.
* The developer may not correctly check for valid board states. This could lead to errors such as the program crashing or incorrect results being outputted.
* The developer may not correctly find the shortest possible number of jumps. This could lead to the program outputting an incorrect answer or taking an excessive amount of time to run.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully test their code and ensure that it handles all possible input cases correctly. They should also use a unit testing framework to help them identify and fix bugs.

Title:
AIZU p01862 How To Make Stars

Pain points:
The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are as follows:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is very specific, and a developer must be careful to parse the input correctly. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format for this problem is also very specific, and a developer must be careful to format the output correctly. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce a correct solution.
* **Incorrect algorithm:** The algorithm used to solve this problem is quite complex, and a developer must be careful to implement it correctly. If the algorithm is incorrect, the program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.
* **Incorrect error handling:** The program must be able to handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input file is not found, the program should print an error message and exit. If the program encounters a runtime error, it should also print an error message and exit.
* **Inefficient algorithm:** The algorithm used to solve this problem can be quite inefficient. A developer should try to optimize the algorithm as much as possible to improve the performance of the program.
* **Memory leaks:** The program should be free of memory leaks. A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. Memory leaks can eventually cause a program to crash.

By carefully avoiding these problems and bugs, a developer can write a program that successfully solves the problem.

Title:
AIZU p01997 Right triangle

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect calculation of the volume of the figure.** The volume of a right triangle is calculated as follows:

```
V = (A * B) / 2
```

where A and B are the lengths of the two sides that are not the hypotenuse. However, the problem statement does not specify which sides are not the hypotenuse, so it is possible to calculate the volume incorrectly.

2. **Incorrect rotation of the triangle.** The triangle can be rotated around either the x-axis or the y-axis. The problem statement does not specify which axis to rotate the triangle around, so it is possible to rotate the triangle incorrectly.

3. **Incorrect calculation of the area of the rotated triangle.** The area of a rotated triangle is calculated as follows:

```
A = (1 / 2) * b * h
```

where b is the base of the triangle and h is the height of the triangle. However, the problem statement does not specify which side is the base or the height of the triangle, so it is possible to calculate the area incorrectly.

4. **Incorrect output of the volume.** The volume of the figure should be rounded to the nearest 6 decimal places. However, the problem statement does not specify the number of decimal places to round to, so it is possible to output the volume incorrectly.

Title:
AIZU p02143 Painting

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrectly initializing the array `X`.** The array `X` should be initialized to all zeros, as specified in the problem statement. If the array is not initialized correctly, the output will be incorrect.
* **Incorrectly computing the remainder of `(A_i + j) / B_i`.** The remainder of `(A_i + j) / B_i` can be computed using the `%` operator in C++. If the remainder is not computed correctly, the output will be incorrect.
* **Incorrectly updating the array `X`.** The array `X` should be updated for each pair of integers `(A_i, B_i)`. If the array is not updated correctly, the output will be incorrect.
* **Incorrectly outputting the final sequence `X`.** The final sequence `X` should be outputted in a single line, with each element separated by a space. If the sequence is not outputted correctly, the output will be incorrect.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly initializing the array `X`:**

```c++
int X[N]; // Incorrect!
int X[N] = {0}; // Correct!
```

* **Incorrectly computing the remainder of `(A_i + j) / B_i`:**

```c++
int remainder = (A_i + j) % B_i; // Incorrect!
int remainder = (A_i + j) % B_i + 1; // Correct!
```

* **Incorrectly updating the array `X`:**

```c++
for (int j = 1; j <= N; j++) {
  X[j] += remainder; // Incorrect!
  X[j] = X[j] % B_i; // Correct!
}
```

* **Incorrectly outputting the final sequence `X`:**

```c++
for (int j = 1; j <= N; j++) {
  cout << X[j] << " "; // Incorrect!
}
cout << endl; // Correct!
```

Title:
AIZU p02284 Binary Search Tree II

Pain points:
The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are as follows:

1. **Incorrect implementation of the binary search tree data structure.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. The binary search tree data structure is a fundamental data structure in computer science, and it is essential to understand how it works in order to implement it correctly.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the insert and find operations.** The insert and find operations are the two most important operations on a binary search tree. It is essential to implement these operations correctly in order for the binary search tree to function properly.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the inorder and preorder tree walks.** The inorder and preorder tree walks are two important ways to traverse a binary search tree. It is essential to implement these tree walks correctly in order to print the keys of the binary search tree in the correct order.
4. **Incorrect handling of errors.** It is important to handle errors gracefully in any program. This is especially important when working with data structures such as binary search trees, which can be prone to errors.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.
