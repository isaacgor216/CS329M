CODECHEF approx2

Pain points:
1. **Not handling the case when K is not an integer**. The problem statement specifies that K is an integer, but the code below does not check for this. This could lead to incorrect results if K is not an integer.
2. **Not handling the case when the input array is empty**. The code below does not handle the case when the input array is empty. This could lead to a runtime error.
3. **Not handling the case when the input array contains duplicate values**. The code below does not handle the case when the input array contains duplicate values. This could lead to incorrect results.
4. **Not using the most efficient algorithm**. The code below uses a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem. This algorithm is not very efficient and could lead to a slow runtime.
5. **Not using appropriate data structures**. The code below uses a list to store the input array. This is not the most efficient data structure for this problem. A more efficient data structure would be a sorted array.

Here are some suggestions for how to avoid these problems:

1. **Check that K is an integer**. The code below can be modified to check that K is an integer by using the `isinstance()` function. For example:

```python
if not isinstance(K, int):
    raise ValueError("K must be an integer")
```

2. **Handle the case when the input array is empty**. The code below can be modified to handle the case when the input array is empty by checking if the length of the array is zero. For example:

```python
if len(A) == 0:
    raise ValueError("Input array must not be empty")
```

3. **Handle the case when the input array contains duplicate values**. The code below can be modified to handle the case when the input array contains duplicate values by using a set to store the unique values in the array. For example:

```python
A = set(A)
```

4. **Use the most efficient algorithm**. The code below can be modified to use a more efficient algorithm by using a binary search to find the smallest absolute difference between two elements in the array. For example:

```python
def find_smallest_difference(A, K):
    """Finds the smallest absolute difference between two elements in the array."""

    # Sort the array.

    A.sort()

    # Initialize the smallest difference and the number of pairs with this difference.

    smallest_difference = float("inf")
    num_pairs = 0

    # Iterate over the array, looking for pairs of elements with the smallest possible difference.

    for i in range(len(A) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(A)):
            difference = abs(A[i] + A[j] - K)
            if difference < smallest_difference:
                smallest_difference = difference
                num_pairs = 1
            elif difference == smallest_difference:
                num_pairs += 1

    return smallest_difference, num_pairs
```

5. **Use appropriate data structures**. The code below can be modified to use a more efficient data structure by using a sorted array to store the input array. For example:

```python
A = sorted(A)
```

Title:
CODECHEF lastdig

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input and output are integers, so it is important to use the correct data type when storing and processing them. For example, if you use a `float` to store an integer, you may lose precision and get incorrect results.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

When iterating over a range of numbers, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, if you are iterating from 0 to 10, you may accidentally include 10 in the range, which would be incorrect.

**3. Using incorrect formulas**

The problem statement gives a specific formula for computing `S(N)` and `D(N)`. It is important to use the correct formulas, otherwise you will get incorrect results.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement specifies some specific edge cases, such as `A = 0` and `B = 0`. It is important to handle these edge cases correctly, otherwise you may get incorrect results.

**5. Using inefficient algorithms**

There are more efficient ways to solve this problem than the naive approach of iterating over all numbers in the range. For example, you can use a hash table to store the values of `S(N)` for each possible value of N. This will allow you to quickly compute the sum of `D(N)` for any range of numbers.

Title:
CODECHEF pd31

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data structure to represent the graph.**

The graph is represented as an adjacency list, which is a list of lists. Each list represents the neighbors of a vertex. For example, if the graph has 3 vertices A, B, and C, and there is an edge between A and B, then the adjacency list would be `[[B], [A], [C]]`.

**2. Not handling the case where the graph is disconnected.**

A graph is disconnected if there are two or more vertices that are not connected by any edges. In this case, the graph is not a tree.

**3. Not handling the case where the graph has a cycle.**

A graph has a cycle if there is a path from a vertex back to itself. In this case, the graph is not a tree.

**4. Not handling the case where the graph has multiple edges between two vertices.**

A graph can have multiple edges between two vertices. In this case, the graph is still a tree.

**5. Not handling the case where the graph has self-loops.**

A graph can have self-loops, which are edges that connect a vertex to itself. In this case, the graph is still a tree.

**6. Using an incorrect algorithm to check if the graph is a tree.**

There are several algorithms that can be used to check if a graph is a tree. The most common algorithm is the depth-first search algorithm. This algorithm works by starting at a vertex and exploring all of its neighbors. If the algorithm can reach every vertex in the graph without visiting the same vertex twice, then the graph is a tree.

Pain points:
1. **Inconsistent constraints.** The problem statement mentions that the maximum value m should be minimized, but the output format says to output the maximum value m.
2. **Incorrect input format.** The problem statement says that the first line of input should contain a number t, the number of test cases. However, the sample input does not contain a number t.
3. **Incorrect output format.** The problem statement says that the output should be a single integer, but the sample output contains multiple lines of text.
4. **Incorrect solution.** The sample solution does not correctly solve the problem. For example, the solution outputs "IMPOSSIBLE" for the second test case, even though there is a feasible assignment for the graph.
5. **Incorrect test cases.** The sample test cases do not test all of the possible edge cases. For example, the sample test cases do not test what happens if there are no edges in the graph.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1008_C. Reorder the Array

Pain points:
**1. Not handling the case where the input array is empty.**

If the input array is empty, the output should be 0. However, some solutions may incorrectly return an error or a non-zero value.

**2. Not handling the case where the input array contains duplicate elements.**

If the input array contains duplicate elements, the output should be the number of unique elements in the array. However, some solutions may incorrectly count the duplicate elements twice.

**3. Not handling the case where the input array is sorted in descending order.**

If the input array is sorted in descending order, the output should be 0. However, some solutions may incorrectly return a non-zero value.

**4. Not handling the case where the input array is sorted in ascending order.**

If the input array is sorted in ascending order, the output should be the length of the array. However, some solutions may incorrectly return a smaller value.

**5. Using an incorrect algorithm.**

The correct algorithm for solving this problem is to sort the input array in ascending order and then count the number of elements that are greater than the element to their left. However, some solutions may use an incorrect algorithm, such as sorting the input array in descending order or counting the number of elements that are less than the element to their left.

**6. Using incorrect data types.**

The input and output of this problem are integers. However, some solutions may use incorrect data types, such as strings or floating-point numbers. This can lead to errors in the output.

**7. Not handling overflow.**

The input and output of this problem can be very large. Some solutions may not handle overflow correctly, which can lead to errors in the output.
Test inputs:
```
# 1. Not handling the case where the input array is empty.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1031_A. Golden Plate

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a number less than 3 or greater than 100.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may contain a negative number or a non-integer number.

**3. Off-by-one error**

The developer may forget to add or subtract 1 when calculating the number of cells to be gilded. For example, the developer may calculate the number of cells in the first ring as `w - 4 * (k - 1)` instead of `w - 4 * k`.

**4. Incorrect calculation of the number of cells to be gilded**

The developer may incorrectly calculate the number of cells to be gilded. For example, the developer may only count the cells in the inner rectangle of each ring, but not the cells in the outer rectangle.

**5. Runtime error**

The developer's code may not run correctly due to a runtime error. For example, the developer's code may try to divide by zero.

**6. Memory error**

The developer's code may run out of memory. For example, the developer's code may create an array that is too large.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1054_A. Elevator or Stairs?

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input variables are integers, but the code uses float variables. This will cause errors when comparing the variables.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator**. The code uses the `==` operator to compare the variables, but this operator checks for equality, not inequality. To check for inequality, you should use the `!=` operator.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code checks if the time it takes to use the elevator is less than the time it takes to use the stairs, but this is not the correct way to determine which option is faster. To determine which option is faster, you need to compare the total time it takes to use each option.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The code incorrectly calculates the number of times the elevator needs to stop to pick up Masha. This causes the code to incorrectly determine that the elevator is faster than the stairs.
5. **Infinite loop**. The code contains an infinite loop that occurs when the elevator is on the same floor as Masha. This loop can be avoided by checking if the elevator is on the same floor as Masha before entering the loop.
6. **Memory leak**. The code does not free the memory allocated for the variables. This can cause a memory leak.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully check your code for errors before submitting it. You can also use a debugger to help you identify and fix errors.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may contain more than one string, or the output may not be a valid string.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not find the smallest possible lexicographically string that can be obtained by removing at most one character from the string s.
4. **Incorrect data**. The data used to test the solution may be incorrect. For example, the data may contain a string that is not lexicographically smaller than another string.
5. **Runtime error**. The solution may run into a runtime error. For example, the solution may run out of memory or the solution may take too long to run.
6. **Memory leak**. The solution may leak memory. For example, the solution may allocate memory that is never freed.
7. **Security vulnerability**. The solution may contain a security vulnerability. For example, the solution may allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1097_A. Gennady and a Card Game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly comparing card suits and ranks.** The code may incorrectly compare the suits and ranks of cards, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the code may compare the suit of the card on the table to the rank of a card in the hand, or vice versa.
2. **Incorrectly checking if a card can be played.** The code may incorrectly check if a card can be played, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the code may check if the card has the same rank as the card on the table, but not the same suit.
3. **Incorrectly handling invalid input.** The code may incorrectly handle invalid input, such as a card with an invalid rank or suit. This could result in a runtime error or an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrectly handling multiple cards with the same rank or suit.** The code may incorrectly handle multiple cards with the same rank or suit, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the code may only allow one card to be played from the hand, even if there are multiple cards with the same rank or suit.
5. **Incorrectly handling the case of the input.** The code may incorrectly handle the case of the input, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the code may treat the cards "2H" and "2h" as different cards.

To avoid these problems, the code should be carefully written and tested. The code should also be documented to make it easy to understand and maintain.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1118_B. Tanya and Candies

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data contains a lot of integers. If you use an incorrect data type to store the input data, it may cause overflow. For example, if you use `int` to store the input data, the following code will cause overflow:

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

To avoid overflow, you should use a larger data type, such as `long`.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The following code is incorrect:

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == a[n - i - 1]:
        ans += 1

print(ans)
```

This code will only count the candies that are equal to their mirror image. For example, if the input data is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the code will only count the candies `1` and `5`. The correct code should count all the candies that satisfy the following condition:

```
sum(a[1:i]) == sum(a[i + 1:])
```

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The following code is incorrect:

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == a[n - i - 1]:
        ans += 1

if n % 2 == 1:
    ans += 1

print(ans)
```

This code will count the candies that are equal to their mirror image twice. For example, if the input data is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the code will count the candies `1` and `5` twice. The correct code should only count the candies that satisfy the following condition:

```
sum(a[1:i]) == sum(a[i + 1:])

CODEFORCES 1144_E. Median String

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**. The input should be a single line containing an integer k, followed by two lines, each containing a string of length k.

**2. The input strings are not of the correct length**. The input strings should be of length k, as specified in the problem statement.

**3. The input strings are not lexicographically less than s and not greater than t**. The input strings should be lexicographically less than s and not greater than t, as specified in the problem statement.

**4. There is not an odd number of strings lexicographically not less than s and not greater than t**. The problem statement guarantees that there is an odd number of strings lexicographically not less than s and not greater than t. If this is not the case, then the solution will not be correct.

**5. The output format is not correct**. The output should be a single string of length k, which is the median of the list of strings of length k lexicographically not less than s and not greater than t.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1165_D. Almost All Divisors

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data is given as integers, so it is important to use the correct data types when storing and processing it. For example, if the input data contains a number that is larger than `int`, using `int` to store the number will cause an overflow error.

**2. Insufficient error handling**

The problem statement states that the input data is guaranteed to be valid. However, in practice, it is possible that the input data may be incorrect. For example, the input data may contain a number that is not an integer, or the input data may contain duplicate divisors. If the code does not handle these errors correctly, it may crash or produce incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The problem statement is not very clear about what it means for a list of divisors to be "almost all" the divisors of a number. One possible interpretation is that the list of divisors must contain all of the prime factors of the number. Another possible interpretation is that the list of divisors must contain all of the divisors of the number up to a certain size. If the code does not correctly implement the desired logic, it may produce incorrect output.

**4. Inefficient algorithms**

The problem can be solved in O(n log n) time using a simple algorithm. However, there are more efficient algorithms that can be used to solve the problem in O(n) time. If the code uses an inefficient algorithm, it may take a long time to run on large input data sets.

**5. Unclear code**

The code should be well-commented and easy to understand. If the code is not clear, it will be difficult for other developers to read and understand, and it will be more likely to contain bugs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1184_C3. Heidi and the Turing Test (Hard)

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is given as a list of integers, but the problem statement requires the output to be a list of floats. This can be easily fixed by casting the integers to floats before printing them.

```python
for i in range(k):
    print(round(x[i], 3), round(y[i], 3), round(r[i], 3))
```

**2. Incorrect calculation of the Hausdorff distance**

The Hausdorff distance is calculated as the maximum of the minimum distances between the two sets of points. However, the code below incorrectly calculates the minimum distance between two points as the absolute value of their difference. This will result in an incorrect Hausdorff distance.

```python
def dist(p1, p2):
    return abs(p1[0] - p2[0]) + abs(p1[1] - p2[1])
```

The correct calculation of the Hausdorff distance is as follows:

```python
def dist(p1, p2):
    return max(abs(p1[0] - p2[0]), abs(p1[1] - p2[1]))
```

**3. Incorrect clustering of the points**

The points are clustered using k-means clustering, but the code below incorrectly initializes the centroids of the clusters. The centroids should be initialized as random points within the dataset, but the code below initializes them as all zeros. This will result in an incorrect clustering of the points.

```python
def kmeans(points, k):
    centroids = [np.zeros(2) for _ in range(k)]
```

The correct initialization of the centroids is as follows:

```python
def kmeans(points, k):
    centroids = np.random.choice(points, k)
```

**4. Incorrect calculation of the radii of the rings**

The radii of the rings are calculated as the average distance between the points in each cluster. However, the code below incorrectly calculates the distance between two points as the absolute value of their difference. This will result in an incorrect calculation of the radii of the rings.

```python
def get_radii(clusters):
    radii = []
    for cluster in clusters:
        radius = np.mean(np.linalg.norm(cluster - np.mean(cluster, axis=0), axis=1))
        radii.append(radius)
    return radii
```

The correct calculation of the distance between two points is as follows:

```python
def get_radii(clusters):
    radii = []
    for cluster in clusters:
        radius = np.mean(np.linalg.norm(cluster - np.mean(cluster, axis=0), axis=1))
        radii.append(radius)
    return radii
```

**5. Incorrect output format**

The output should be a list of k lines, each describing a single ring. Each line should contain three real numbers x_i, y_i, r_i, where (x_i, y_i) and r_i are the coordinates and the radius of the i-th ring. However, the code below incorrectly outputs the radii of the rings as integers.

```python
for i in range(k):
    print(round(x[i], 3), round(y[i], 3), round(r[i], 3))
```

The correct output format is as follows:

```python
for i in range(k):
    print(x[i], y[i], r[i])
```

    clusters = [[] for _ in range(k)]

Title:
CODEFORCES 1202_F. You Are Given Some Letters...

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect calculation of the period.** The period of a string is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $s_i = s_{i \mod k}$ for all $i$. A common mistake is to forget to take the modulus when calculating $s_{i \mod k}$. For example, if the string is "ABAABAA", the period is not 3, because $s_4 \neq s_{4 \mod 3} = s_1$. The correct period is 5.
2. **Incorrect handling of strings with repeated characters.** If a string contains repeated characters, the period may not be unique. For example, the string "AAAA" has two possible periods: 1 and 4. To handle this case, we need to consider all possible ways to group the repeated characters together. For example, the string "AAAA" can be grouped as "A(A(A(A)))", "A(A(A(A)))", "(A(A(A)))A", and "(A(A(A)))A". Each of these groupings has a different period.
3. **Incorrect handling of strings with leading or trailing zeros.** If a string contains leading or trailing zeros, the period may not be unique. For example, the string "00001000" has two possible periods: 1 and 5. To handle this case, we need to consider all possible ways to remove the leading and trailing zeros. For example, the string "00001000" can be converted to "1000" or "00001". Each of these strings has a different period.
4. **Incorrect handling of strings with negative characters.** The problem statement does not specify whether negative characters are allowed. If negative characters are allowed, the period of a string may not be unique. For example, the string "-1-1-1-1" has two possible periods: 1 and 4. To handle this case, we need to decide whether or not to allow negative characters.
5. **Incorrect handling of strings with non-alphabetic characters.** The problem statement does not specify whether non-alphabetic characters are allowed. If non-alphabetic characters are allowed, the period of a string may not be unique. For example, the string "12345678" has two possible periods: 1 and 8. To handle this case, we need to decide whether or not to allow non-alphabetic characters.

CODEFORCES 1244_F. Chips

Pain points:
**1. Off-by-one errors**

When iterating through the array of chips, it is easy to make an off-by-one error and skip a chip or count a chip twice. This can be avoided by using a modulus operator to wrap around the array when the index exceeds the array size.

**2. Incorrect array indexing**

When accessing elements of the array of chips, it is important to make sure that the indices are within the bounds of the array. This can be done by using the `array.length` property to get the size of the array.

**3. Using the wrong data type**

The input and output of this problem are strings, so it is important to use the `String` data type when working with them. Using the wrong data type can lead to errors such as typecasting errors or incorrect results.

**4. Not handling corner cases**

The input to this problem can contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or non-existent indices. It is important to handle these corner cases gracefully so that the program does not crash.

**5. Insufficient error handling**

If the program encounters an error, it is important to handle the error gracefully and provide the user with an informative error message. This can be done by using the `throw` statement to throw an exception.

**6. Using inefficient algorithms**

The algorithm used to solve this problem can be inefficient if it does not take into account the fact that the chips are arranged in a circle. A more efficient algorithm would be to use a deque to store the chips and then iterate through the deque twice, once in each direction.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1264_D1. Beautiful Bracket Sequence (easy version)

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of data types**

When working with large numbers, it is important to use the correct data types. For example, if you are working with numbers that are larger than 2^31-1, you should use `long` instead of `int`.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when you forget to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a program that outputs the wrong answer or a program that crashes.

**3. Array out-of-bounds errors**

Array out-of-bounds errors occur when you try to access an element of an array that does not exist. This can lead to a program crash or incorrect results.

**4. Null pointer exceptions**

Null pointer exceptions occur when you try to access a variable that has not been initialized. This can lead to a program crash or incorrect results.

**5. Memory leaks**

Memory leaks occur when you allocate memory for a variable but do not free it when you are finished with it. This can lead to a program running out of memory and crashing.

**6. Race conditions**

Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or a program crash.

**7. Deadlocks**

Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can lead to a program being stuck and unable to continue.

**8. Security vulnerabilities**

Security vulnerabilities can occur when a program does not properly validate user input. This can allow attackers to gain access to the program or to modify its data.

**9. Incorrect error handling**

Incorrect error handling can lead to a program crashing or continuing to run even though it is in an invalid state. This can lead to security vulnerabilities or data loss.

**10. Inefficient algorithms**

Inefficient algorithms can lead to a program running slowly or using more memory than necessary. This can make a program unusable or slow down other programs on the same system.

CODEFORCES 1285_F. Classical?

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the LCM algorithm.** The LCM of two numbers can be calculated as follows:

```
LCM(x, y) = (x * y) / GCD(x, y)
```

where GCD is the greatest common divisor of x and y. A common mistake is to use the following incorrect formula:

```
LCM(x, y) = x * y
```

This will not always give the correct answer, as it does not take into account the possibility that x and y may have a common factor.

2. **Using an incorrect data structure.** The input array is not sorted, so a simple linear scan will not work. A more efficient approach is to use a sorted data structure, such as a binary search tree or a hash table.

3. **Not handling edge cases.** The input array may contain duplicate elements, or it may be empty. Be sure to handle these cases correctly.

4. **Insufficient testing.** It is important to test your code thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly for all possible inputs. This includes testing for edge cases, as well as testing with different data types and sizes.

5. **Not using the most efficient algorithm.** There are several different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. Be sure to use the most efficient algorithm available.
Test inputs:
```
# 1. Incorrect implementation of the LCM algorithm

CODEFORCES 1305_A. Kuroni and the Gifts

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or it may contain a number that is too large. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the output may contain a number that is not an integer, or it may contain a number that is too large. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect output.

**3. Undefined behavior**

The program may contain code that is not defined by the C++ standard. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect output.

**4. Memory leaks**

The program may not free memory that it has allocated. This can eventually lead to a memory overflow, which can cause the program to crash.

**5. Race conditions**

The program may access shared data without first ensuring that no other thread is accessing it. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output or to crash.

**6. Deadlocks**

The program may enter a situation where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely.

**7. Security vulnerabilities**

The program may contain code that is vulnerable to attacks such as buffer overflows or SQL injection. This can allow an attacker to gain control of the program or to steal sensitive data.

**8. Incorrect algorithm**

The program may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output or to run very slowly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1329_C. Drazil Likes Heap

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the heap data structure.** The heap should be implemented in a way that ensures that the heap property is always maintained. This means that the parent of each node should have a greater value than the node itself, and the children of each node should be in decreasing order. If the heap is not implemented correctly, then the algorithm will not work correctly.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the function f.** The function f should take an index i as its input and should return the value of the element at that index. If the element at index i is 0, then the function should return -1. If the function is not implemented correctly, then the algorithm will not work correctly.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum sum.** The minimum sum is the sum of the smallest 2^g-1 elements in the heap. If the minimum sum is not calculated correctly, then the output of the algorithm will be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect output of the function calls.** The function calls should be output in the order in which they are performed. If the function calls are not output in the correct order, then the output of the algorithm will be incorrect.
5. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The algorithm should handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the heap contains only one element, then the algorithm should return the value of that element and output no function calls.

By following these tips, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1349_C. Orac and Game of Life

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of pointers**

When using pointers, it is important to make sure that you are dereferencing them correctly. For example, the following code would cause a segmentation fault:

```c++
int* p = new int;
*p = 10;
delete p;
```

This is because the pointer `p` is pointing to memory that has been freed, and dereferencing it will cause a segmentation fault.

To avoid this problem, you should always make sure that you delete pointers before you dereference them. You can also use the `nullptr` keyword to indicate that a pointer is not pointing to anything.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when you forget to increment or decrement a variable by one. For example, the following code would print the wrong output:

```c++
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  cout << i << endl;
}
```

This code will print the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. However, it should print the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

To avoid this problem, you should always be careful to increment and decrement variables by the correct amount. You can also use the `++` and `--` operators to increment and decrement variables by one.

**3. Using the wrong data type**

Using the wrong data type can lead to incorrect results. For example, the following code would cause a compiler error:

```c++
int x = 10;
char y = x;
```

This is because the variable `y` is a char, which can only store a single character. The variable `x` is an int, which can store a larger range of values.

To avoid this problem, you should always make sure that you are using the correct data type for your variables. You can use the `int`, `char`, `float`, and `double` data types to store integers, characters, floating-point numbers, and double-precision floating-point numbers, respectively.

**4. Forgetting to initialize variables**

Forgetting to initialize variables can lead to undefined behavior. For example, the following code would cause a compiler error:

```c++
int x;
cout << x << endl;
```

This is because the variable `x` has not been initialized, and its value is undefined. To avoid this problem, you should always initialize your variables before you use them. You can initialize variables to a specific value, or you can initialize them to the default value for their data type.

**5. Using uninitialized memory**

Using uninitialized memory can lead to security vulnerabilities. For example, the following code would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on your computer:

```c++
char* buffer = new char[100];
strcpy(buffer, "A string");
```

The variable `buffer` is not initialized before it is used to store the string "A string". This means that the attacker could overwrite the contents of `buffer` with their own code, which could then be executed when the program is run.

To avoid this problem, you should always initialize memory before you use it. You can initialize memory to a specific value, or you can use the `memset()` function to fill memory with a specific value.
Test inputs:
**Incorrect use of pointers**

  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    cout << i << endl;
  }
  // 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
  return 0;
}
```

**Using the wrong data type**

```

int main() {
  int x = 10;
  char y = x;
  // compiler error: invalid conversion from ‘int’ to ‘char’

CODEFORCES 136_A. Presents

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n, and the second line should contain n space-separated integers. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the program should print n space-separated integers. If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly produce output and will likely receive a negative score on the contest.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating through the list of friends, it is important to make sure that the indices are correct. An off-by-one error can cause the program to skip a friend or process the same friend twice, which will result in incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program must be correct in order to produce the correct output. A common mistake is to assume that all friends will give a gift to someone else. This is not always the case, and if the program does not account for this, it will produce incorrect output.
5. **Memory leaks.** The program must be careful not to allocate memory that it does not need. Memory leaks can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
6. **Race conditions.** If multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is important to ensure that the data is properly synchronized. Race conditions can cause the program to produce incorrect output or crash.
7. **Deadlocks.** If multiple threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, it is possible for the program to deadlock. Deadlocks can cause the program to run indefinitely or crash.
8. **Buffer overflows.** If the program writes data to a buffer that is not large enough, it can cause a buffer overflow. Buffer overflows can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system.
9. **Format string vulnerabilities.** If the program uses format strings incorrectly, it can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system.
10. **SQL injection vulnerabilities.** If the program uses SQL queries incorrectly, it can allow attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database.

5. **Incorrect memory usage**. The program may use too much memory. For example, the program may use gigabytes of memory on a large input.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and to correctly implement the solution. It is also important to test the program on a variety of inputs to ensure that it is correct and efficient.

CODEFORCES 1416_C. XOR Inverse

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for `a` and `b`**

The input data is an array of integers, so we need to use an integer data type to store the elements of `a` and `b`. If we use a data type that is too small, such as `int`, we may lose precision and get incorrect results. For example, if we have an input array of `a = [10, 11]` and we use `int` to store the elements, then `b = [10, 11]` will have 1 inversion, but the correct answer is 0.

**2. Using the wrong data type for `x`**

The output data is the minimum number of inversions and the minimum value of `x`. The minimum number of inversions is an integer, so we need to use an integer data type to store it. The minimum value of `x` can be any integer, so we can use any data type to store it. However, it is important to note that the minimum value of `x` may be negative, so we need to make sure that the data type we use can store negative values.

**3. Not considering the case where `a` is empty**

The input data may be empty. In this case, the output should be `(0, 0)`. However, if we don't consider this case, we may get incorrect results. For example, if we have an empty input array, then `b = [0]` will have 0 inversions, but the correct answer is 0.

**4. Not considering the case where all elements of `a` are equal**

The input data may contain all equal elements. In this case, the output should be `(0, 0)`. However, if we don't consider this case, we may get incorrect results. For example, if we have an input array of `a = [10]`, then `b = [10]` will have 0 inversions, but the correct answer is 0.

**5. Not using the correct algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a simple greedy algorithm. We iterate over the elements of `a` and add them to `b` one by one. When we add an element to `b`, we also update the minimum value of `x`. The minimum value of `x` is the smallest value that we can add to all elements of `a` so that there are no inversions in `b`.

**6. Not handling overflows**

When we add the elements of `a` to `b`, we need to make sure that we don't overflow. This can happen if the elements of `a` are very large. To avoid this, we can use a data type that is large enough to store the elements of `a`.

**7. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed. You can test your code by using a variety of input data, including empty arrays, arrays with all equal elements, and arrays with large elements.
Test inputs:
```
# 1. Using the wrong data type for `a` and `b`

```
n = int(input())
a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
b = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

```

# 2. Using the wrong data type for `x`

```
n = int(input())
a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
b = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

x = 0
for i in range(n):
    b[i] = b[i] + x

```

# 3. Not considering the case where `a` is empty

```
n = int(input())
a = []
b = []

x = 0
for i in range(n):
    b[i] = b[i] + x

```

# 4. Not considering the case where all elements of `a` are equal

```
n = int(input())
a = [10] * n
b = [10] * n

# The minimum value of `x` is the smallest value that we can add to all elements of `a` so that there are no inversions in `b`.

min_x = float('inf')
for i in range(n):
    x = x + 1
    b[i] = b[i] + x
    if not any(b[i] > b[j] for j in range(i + 1, n)):
        min_x = min(min_x, x)

print(min_x)

```

# 6. Not handling overflows

```
n = int(input())
a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
b = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

x = 0
for i in range(n):

# Test your code by using a variety of input data, including empty arrays, arrays with all equal elements, and arrays with large elements.

if n == 0:
    assert(min_x == 0)
elif all(a[i] == a[j] for i in range(n) for j in range(i + 1, n)):
    assert(min_x == 0)
elif max_a > 2 ** 31 - 1:
    assert(min_x == -1)

Title:
CODEFORCES 1433_B. Yet Another Bookshelf

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not always followed correctly. For example, the input may contain a space between two integers, or it may contain a newline character instead of a comma. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is also not always followed correctly. For example, the output may contain a space between two integers, or it may contain a newline character instead of a comma. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect output.

**3. Undefined behavior**

The problem may not specify what happens in certain situations. For example, what happens if there are no books on the bookshelf? What happens if there are two books next to each other? What happens if there are two gaps next to each other? The program must handle these situations correctly, or it may crash or produce incorrect output.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

It is easy to make off-by-one errors when programming. For example, the program may count the number of books incorrectly, or it may calculate the number of moves incorrectly. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect output.

**5. Logical errors**

The program may contain logical errors. For example, the program may assume that the input is always valid, or it may assume that the output format is always correct. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1458_A. Row GCD

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input and output of this problem are both integers. However, if you accidentally use a floating-point type to store the integers, you will get incorrect results. For example, if you use `float` to store the integers, you will get the following output for the input `[1, 25, 121, 169]` and `[1, 2, 7, 23]`:

```
[2.0, 3.0, 8.0, 24.0]
```

This is because the floating-point type is not precise enough to represent integers accurately.

**2. Not using the correct algorithm**

The correct algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of a set of integers is the Euclidean algorithm. However, if you accidentally use a different algorithm, you will get incorrect results. For example, if you use the sum-product algorithm to find the greatest common divisor, you will get the following output for the input `[1, 25, 121, 169]` and `[1, 2, 7, 23]`:

```
[3, 3, 3, 3]
```

This is because the sum-product algorithm does not always find the greatest common divisor.

**3. Not handling negative integers correctly**

The input and output of this problem are both positive integers. However, if you accidentally handle negative integers incorrectly, you will get incorrect results. For example, if you accidentally add a negative integer to the set of integers, you will get the following output for the input `[1, 25, 121, 169]` and `[1, 2, 7, -23]`:

```
[2, 3, 8, -24]
```

This is because the greatest common divisor of a set of integers that includes a negative integer is not well-defined.

**4. Not handling duplicate integers correctly**

The input and output of this problem are both positive integers. However, if you accidentally handle duplicate integers incorrectly, you will get incorrect results. For example, if you accidentally add the same integer to the set of integers twice, you will get the following output for the input `[1, 25, 121, 169]` and `[1, 2, 7, 23, 23]`:

```
[2, 3, 8, 24, 24]
```

This is because the greatest common divisor of a set of integers that includes duplicate integers is not well-defined.

**5. Not handling overflows correctly**

The input and output of this problem are both positive integers. However, if you accidentally overflow an integer, you will get incorrect results. For example, if you accidentally add two integers that are too large, you will get the following output for the input `[1, 25, 121, 169]` and `[1, 2, 7, 23]`:

```
[-2147483648, -2147483648, -2147483648, -2147483648]
```

This is because the greatest common divisor of a set of integers that includes an integer that is too large is not well-defined.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1481_A. Space Navigation 

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format for this problem is not very strict. It allows for spaces between the numbers and the characters in the string `s`. However, if you forget to include a space between the numbers in `p_x` and `p_y`, or between the characters in `s`, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly and will throw an error.

For example, the following input would cause an error:

```
10 5RRRRRRRRRRUUUUU
```

The correct input should be:

```
10 5
RRRRRRRRRRUUUUU
```

### 2. Incorrect output format

The output format for this problem is also not very strict. It allows for spaces between the letters in the word `YES` or `NO`. However, if you forget to include a space, the program will not be able to parse the output correctly and will throw an error.

For example, the following output would cause an error:

```
YESNO
```

The correct output should be:

```
YES
NO
```

### 3. Using the wrong data type

The problem states that the coordinates of Planetforces (`p_x` and `p_y`) and the length of the string `s` are integers. However, if you accidentally use a floating-point data type for these values, the program will not be able to perform the correct calculations and will give you an incorrect answer.

For example, the following code would give you an incorrect answer:

```
p_x = float(input())
p_y = float(input())
```

The correct code should be:

```
p_x = int(input())
p_y = int(input())
```

### 4. Using the wrong algorithm

The problem can be solved using a simple algorithm that checks if the final position of the spaceship (after executing all the orders in `s`) is the same as the coordinates of Planetforces. However, if you use a more complex algorithm, you may end up with an incorrect answer.

For example, the following algorithm would give you an incorrect answer:

```
def is_reachable(p_x, p_y, s):
  """
  Checks if the final position of the spaceship is the same as the coordinates of Planetforces.

  Args:
    p_x: The x-coordinate of Planetforces.
    p_y: The y-coordinate of Planetforces.
    s: The string of orders.

  Returns:
    True if the final position of the spaceship is the same as the coordinates of Planetforces, False otherwise.
  """

  # Initialize the position of the spaceship.
  x = 0
  y = 0

  # Iterate over the orders in s.
  for order in s:
    # Move the spaceship according to the order.
    if order == 'U':
      y += 1
    elif order == 'D':
      y -= 1
    elif order == 'R':
      x += 1
    elif order == 'L':
      x -= 1

  # Check if the final position of the spaceship is the same as the coordinates of Planetforces.
  if x == p_x and y == p_y:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

The correct algorithm should be:

```
def is_reachable(p_x, p_y, s):
  """
  Checks if the final position of the spaceship is the same as the coordinates of Planetforces.

  Args:
    p_x: The x-coordinate of Planetforces.

2. **Off-by-one errors.** These errors can occur when counting or indexing elements in an array or list. Make sure to check your code carefully for off-by-one errors.
3. **Incorrect data types.** Make sure to use the correct data types for your variables. For example, if you are counting the number of elements in an array, you should use an integer data type rather than a floating-point data type.
4. **Incorrect assumptions.** Make sure to carefully check your assumptions about the input data. For example, if you are given a list of integers, you should make sure that all of the elements are actually integers.
5. **Uninitialized variables.** Make sure to initialize all of your variables before using them. This will help to prevent errors caused by undefined values.
6. **Incorrect variable scope.** Make sure to use the correct variable scope for your variables. For example, if you declare a variable inside a function, it will only be available inside that function.
7. **Incorrect function calls.** Make sure to call functions correctly. For example, make sure to pass the correct arguments to the function and make sure to return the correct value from the function.
8. **Incorrect error handling.** Make sure to handle errors correctly. For example, if a function encounters an error, it should return an appropriate error code.
9. **Inefficient code.** Make sure to write efficient code. This will help your program run faster and use less memory.

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not always correctly followed, and this can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a prime number that is not in the range specified, the program will crash.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is also important, and if it is not correctly followed, the program will not produce the correct results. For example, if the output contains a number that is not an integer, the program will not be correct.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic of the program is also important, and if it is not correct, the program will not produce the correct results. For example, if the program does not correctly count the number of matrices that can be passwords to a safe, the program will not be correct.
* **Incorrect use of data structures:** The program may use data structures incorrectly, which can lead to errors. For example, if the program uses a linked list to store the prime numbers, and the linked list is not correctly implemented, the program will crash.
* **Incorrect use of algorithms:** The program may use algorithms incorrectly, which can lead to errors. For example, if the program uses a sorting algorithm to sort the prime numbers, and the algorithm is not correctly implemented, the program will not produce the correct results.

CODEFORCES 229_B. Planets

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not strictly defined. For example, the input `4 6
1 2 2
1 3 3
1 4 8
2 3 4
2 4 5
3 4 3
0
1 3
2 3 4
0` is incorrect because it has two lines with `3 4`. The correct input should be `4 6
1 2 2
1 3 3
1 4 8
2 3 4
2 4 5
3 4 3
0
1 3
3 4
0`.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is also not strictly defined. For example, the output `7` is incorrect because it does not have a newline character at the end. The correct output should be `7\n`.

**3. Undefined behavior**

The problem does not specify what to do in case of undefined behavior. For example, what should happen if there are no stargate connections between any two planets? The correct solution should handle this case gracefully.

**4. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the following algorithm is incorrect:

```
def solve():
  # Get the input.
  n, m = map(int, input().split())
  edges = []
  for _ in range(m):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    edges.append((a, b, c))
  # Find the shortest path from planet 1 to planet n.
  path = []
  for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if i == n:
      path.append(i)
      break
    for edge in edges:
      if edge[0] == i and edge[1] not in path:
        path.append(edge[1])
        break
  # Return the length of the shortest path.
  return len(path)

# Get the output.
print(solve())
```

This algorithm is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that other travellers may arrive to the planet where Jack is currently located. For example, if Jack is on planet 1 and other travellers arrive to planet 1 at time 0, then Jack cannot travel to planet 2 at time 1 because the stargate will be unavailable.

**5. Memory limit exceeded**

The algorithm used to solve the problem may exceed the memory limit. For example, the following algorithm exceeds the memory limit:

```
def solve():
  # Get the input.
  n, m = map(int, input().split())
  edges = []
  for _ in range(m):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    edges.append((a, b, c))
  # Find all possible paths from planet 1 to planet n.
  paths = []
  for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if i == n:
      paths.append([i])
      continue
    for edge in edges:
      if edge[0] == i:
        for path in paths:
          path.append(edge[1])
          paths.append(path)
  # Return the shortest path from planet 1 to planet n.
  return min(paths, key=len)

# Get the output.
print(solve())
```

This algorithm stores all possible paths from planet 1 to planet n in memory, which can exceed the memory limit for large values of n and m.

**6. Time limit exceeded**

CODEFORCES 566_B. Replicating Processes

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrectly counting the number of processes on a server.** This is a common mistake that can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results. It is important to remember that each process takes up 100 MB of RAM, and that the server also needs 100 MB of RAM for its own needs.
* **Not taking into account the order in which the rules are applied.** The order in which the rules are applied is important, as it can affect the number of processes on a server at any given time. It is important to make sure that the rules are applied in such a way that the number of processes on a server never exceeds 9.
* **Not handling all possible cases.** The problem statement specifies that there are a limited number of servers and a limited number of processes. It is important to make sure that the program handles all possible cases, including cases where there are more processes than servers or cases where some of the servers are down.
* **Using incorrect data types.** The problem statement specifies that the number of servers and the number of processes are integers. It is important to make sure that the program uses the correct data types for these values, as using incorrect data types can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

**Additional tips:**

* When debugging your program, it can be helpful to print out the number of processes on each server at each step of the algorithm. This can help you identify any problems with your logic.
* It is also helpful to draw a diagram of the servers and the processes. This can help you visualize the problem and see how the rules are applied.
* Finally, it is important to test your program thoroughly. This means testing it with different input values and making sure that it produces the correct results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 609_E. Minimum spanning tree for each edge

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of Prim's algorithm**

Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree in a weighted undirected graph. It works by iteratively adding the edge with the smallest weight that does not create a cycle to the spanning tree.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing Prim's algorithm is to incorrectly check for cycles. To avoid this mistake, it is important to remember that a cycle is formed when two vertices are connected by more than one edge.

**2. Using an incorrect data structure**

Another common mistake that developers make when solving this problem is to use an incorrect data structure. Prim's algorithm requires a data structure that can quickly find the edge with the smallest weight that does not create a cycle. A common mistake is to use a hash table to store the edges, as this data structure does not support efficient range queries.

A better data structure to use is a Fibonacci heap. Fibonacci heaps support efficient range queries, which makes them ideal for implementing Prim's algorithm.

**3. Not handling degenerate cases**

There are a few degenerate cases that developers should be aware of when implementing Prim's algorithm. One common degenerate case is when the graph is a tree. In this case, Prim's algorithm will simply return the edges of the graph in any order.

Another degenerate case is when the graph is a forest. In this case, Prim's algorithm will return the minimum spanning tree for each connected component of the graph.

**4. Not handling negative weights**

Prim's algorithm can be used to find a minimum spanning tree in a weighted undirected graph with negative weights. However, there are a few things that developers should be aware of when dealing with negative weights.

First, it is important to remember that a graph with negative weights may not have a minimum spanning tree. If the graph contains a cycle with a negative weight, then the minimum spanning tree does not exist.

Second, it is important to handle negative weights carefully when implementing Prim's algorithm. If an edge with a negative weight is added to the spanning tree, then the algorithm may not terminate. To avoid this problem, it is important to check for negative cycles before adding an edge to the spanning tree.

**5. Not handling duplicate edges**

A graph with duplicate edges is a graph that contains two or more edges that connect the same two vertices. Prim's algorithm can be used to find a minimum spanning tree in a graph with duplicate edges. However, there are a few things that developers should be aware of when dealing with duplicate edges.

First, it is important to remember that Prim's algorithm will only add one of the duplicate edges to the spanning tree. The edge that is added to the spanning tree is the edge with the smallest weight.

Second, it is important to handle duplicate edges carefully when implementing Prim's algorithm. If two duplicate edges are added to the spanning tree, then the algorithm may not terminate. To avoid this problem, it is important to check for duplicate edges before adding an edge to the spanning tree.

CODEFORCES 630_D. Hexagons!

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not specified in the problem statement. A developer may assume that the input is a single integer, but it could also be a list of integers, a string, or even a file.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not specified in the problem statement. A developer may assume that the output is a single integer, but it could also be a list of integers, a string, or even a file.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of hexagons**. The number of hexagons can be calculated using the following formula:

```
N = 6 * n * (n + 1)
```

However, a developer may make a mistake in the calculation, resulting in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. The problem statement does not specify what to do in the case of an edge case, such as when `n = 0`. A developer may assume that the answer is 0, but it could also be 1 or some other value.
5. **Other bugs**. There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem, such as memory leaks, race conditions, and deadlocks. It is important to be aware of these potential problems and to take steps to avoid them.

Title:
CODEFORCES 680_C. Bear and Prime 100

Pain points:
### 1. Using the wrong data type for the hidden number

The hidden number is an integer from the interval [2, 100]. If you use a data type that is not large enough to store this range, you will get an incorrect answer. For example, if you use a `char` to store the hidden number, you will only be able to store values from 0 to 255, which is not enough.

### 2. Not flushing the output after each query

As the problem description states, you must flush the output after each query. This means that you must call the `fflush()` function in C++, the `System.out.flush()` method in Java, the `stdout.flush()` method in Python, or the `flush()` procedure in Pascal. If you do not flush the output, the system will not be able to read your response and you will get an incorrect answer.

### 3. Asking more than 20 queries

The problem description states that you can only ask up to 20 queries. If you ask more than 20 queries, you will get a `Wrong Answer` verdict.

### 4. Printing an integer that is not in the range [2, 100]

The problem description states that you can only print integers from the range [2, 100]. If you print an integer that is not in this range, you will get a `Wrong Answer` verdict.

### 5. Printing the wrong answer

The problem description states that you must print either `prime` or `composite` as the answer. If you print any other string, you will get a `Wrong Answer` verdict.

### 6. Not terminating your program

The problem description states that you must terminate your program after printing the answer. If you do not terminate your program, you will get an `Idleness Limit Exceeded` verdict.
Test inputs:
1. **Using the wrong data type for the hidden number**

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int hidden_number = 50;

    // This will not work because `char` is not large enough to store the hidden number.
    char answer = 'yes';

    // This will work because `int` is large enough to store the hidden number.
    int answer = 'yes';

    return 0;
}
```

2. **Not flushing the output after each query**

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int hidden_number = 50;

    // This will not work because the output is not flushed after the query.
    printf("50\n");
    scanf(" %c\n", &answer);

    // This will work because the output is flushed after the query.
    printf("50\n");
    fflush(stdout);
    scanf(" %c\n", &answer);

    return 0;
}
```

3. **Asking more than 20 queries**

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int hidden_number = 50;

    // This will not work because the number of queries exceeds 20.
    for (int i = 0; i < 21; i++) {
        printf("50\n");
        fflush(stdout);
        scanf(" %c\n", &answer);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

4. **Printing an integer that is not in the range [2, 100]**

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int hidden_number = 50;

    // This will not work because the integer printed is not in the range [2, 100].
    printf("101\n");
    fflush(stdout);
    scanf(" %c\n", &answer);

    return 0;
}
```

5. **Printing the wrong answer**

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int hidden_number = 50;

    // This will not work because the answer printed is not correct.
    printf("notprime\n");
    fflush(stdout);
    scanf(" %c\n", &answer);

    return 0;
}
```

6. **Not terminating your program**

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int hidden_number = 50;

    // This will not work because the program does not terminate.
    printf("50\n");

    for (;;) {
    }

    return 0;

Title:
CODEFORCES 703_B. Mishka and trip

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input format specifies that the number of cities and capital cities are integers, but the code uses `float` to store them. This will cause the code to produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect variable initialization**. The code initializes the variable `sum` to 0, but this is not necessary because the default value of an integer variable is 0.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code iterates over the capital cities and adds the product of their beauty values to the variable `sum`. However, this does not take into account the roads between non-capital cities.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The code iterates over the capital cities from 1 to `k`, but the last capital city is indexed by `k - 1`. This means that the code will miss the last capital city.
5. **Unnecessary computation**. The code computes the product of the beauty values of two cities twice, once when it iterates over the capital cities and once when it iterates over the non-capital cities. This is unnecessary because the product of the beauty values of two cities is the same regardless of the order in which the cities are listed.
6. **Incorrect output format**. The code prints the value of the variable `sum`, but the output format specifies that the only output should be an integer.

To fix these problems, we can do the following:

1. Change the variable type of `n` and `k` to `int`.
2. Remove the initialization of the variable `sum`.
3. Iterate over the capital cities from 0 to `k - 1`.
4. Add the product of the beauty values of the current capital city and the next city to the variable `sum`.
5. Check that the index of the current city is less than the number of cities.
6. Print the value of the variable `sum`.

Title:
CODEFORCES 725_B. Food on the Plane

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input format is not clear. For example, is "1f" a valid input? What about "1a3" or "1f3"?
* The problem statement does not specify how to handle seats that are not on the right or left side of the aisle. For example, what if Vasya's seat is "1c"?
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if there are no passengers in a row. For example, what if row 1 is empty?
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if the flight attendants are not synchronized. For example, what if the first flight attendant finishes serving row 1 and moves to row 2, but the second flight attendant is still serving row 3?
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if the flight attendants get stuck. For example, what if the first flight attendant is serving row 1 and the second flight attendant is serving row 3, but there is a passenger in row 2 who refuses to move?

To avoid these problems, the following should be considered when solving the problem:

* The input format should be explicitly defined.
* The problem statement should clearly specify how to handle seats that are not on the right or left side of the aisle.
* The problem statement should clearly specify what happens if there are no passengers in a row.
* The problem statement should clearly specify what happens if the flight attendants are not synchronized.
* The problem statement should clearly specify what happens if the flight attendants get stuck.

Title:
CODEFORCES 747_B. Mammoth's Genome Decoding

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain an integer n, and the second line should contain a string s. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to parse the input and will produce an error.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the program should print the decoded genome. If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will produce an error.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program must be able to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal. If the program's logic is incorrect, it will not be able to decode the genome correctly and will produce an incorrect output.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The program must be careful to account for all of the nucleotides in the genome. If the program misses a nucleotide or counts a nucleotide twice, it will not be able to decode the genome correctly.
5. **Memory errors**. The program must be careful not to allocate too much memory. If the program allocates too much memory, it will crash.
6. **Time complexity**. The program must be able to decode the genome in a reasonable amount of time. If the program takes too long to run, it will not be able to solve the problem in a timely manner.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* **Test your code thoroughly**. Before submitting your code, make sure to test it thoroughly on a variety of input data. This will help you to identify and fix any errors in your code.
* **Use a debugger**. A debugger can help you to track down errors in your code. By stepping through your code line by line, you can identify the exact location of the error and fix it.
* **Read the problem statement carefully**. Make sure that you understand the problem statement before you start coding. This will help you to avoid making mistakes in your implementation.
* **Use the resources available to you**. There are a number of resources available to help you with coding problems. These resources include online forums, books, and articles.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs that developers encounter when solving coding problems.

CODEFORCES 76_E. Points

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific. Make sure that you read and understand the problem statement carefully before starting to code.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. When computing the sum of squares of distances between all pairs of points, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, you might accidentally compute the sum of squares of distances between all pairs of points except the first one.
3. **Double counting**. When computing the sum of squares of distances between all pairs of points, it is also easy to double count some of the distances. For example, you might accidentally count the distance between two points twice.
4. **Inefficient algorithms**. There are more efficient algorithms for computing the sum of squares of distances between all pairs of points than the brute-force algorithm. If you are using a brute-force algorithm, your code will likely be slow.
5. **Memory leaks**. If you are not careful, your code could leak memory. This can be a problem if you are running your code on a system with limited memory.
6. **Synchronization errors**. If you are running your code on a multi-threaded system, you need to be careful to avoid synchronization errors. These errors can cause your code to produce incorrect results.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. If you are not careful, your code could be vulnerable to security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to gain access to your system or steal your data.

CODEFORCES 840_A. Leha and Function

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**

The input format of the problem is:

```
m
a1, a2, ..., am
b1, b2, ..., bm
```

where `m` is the length of arrays `A` and `B`, and `a1, a2, ..., am` and `b1, b2, ..., bm` are the elements of arrays `A` and `B`, respectively.

If the input format is not correct, the program will crash. For example, if the input is:

```
5
7 3 5 3 4
2 1 3 2 3
```

the program will crash because the second line of input does not have 5 elements.

**2. The output format is not correct**

The output format of the problem is:

```
a'1, a'2, ..., a'm
```

where `a'1, a'2, ..., a'm` are the elements of the rearranged array `A'`.

If the output format is not correct, the program will not produce the correct output. For example, if the output is:

```
4 7 3 5 3
```

the program will not produce the correct output because the output does not have 5 elements.

**3. The program does not correctly find the maximum possible sum**

The goal of the problem is to find the maximum possible sum of the rearranged array `A'`. The program must correctly find this maximum possible sum.

For example, if the input is:

```
5
7 3 5 3 4
2 1 3 2 3
```

the maximum possible sum of the rearranged array `A'` is 28. The program must correctly find this maximum possible sum.

**4. The program runs too slowly**

The program must run in a reasonable amount of time. If the program runs too slowly, it will not be able to finish in time.

For example, if the input is:

```
100000
100000 100000 100000 100000 100000 100000 100000 100000 100000 100000

CODEFORCES 90_A. Cableway

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not correctly followed, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the input is "1 2 3 a", the program will crash because it cannot parse the letter "a" as an integer.
2. **Incorrect calculation.** The program may incorrectly calculate the time it takes for all students to ascend to the top of the mountain. For example, if the program assumes that each cablecar can transport three people, it will produce an incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one error.** The program may incorrectly count the number of students in each group or the number of cablecars that have arrived. For example, if the program counts the number of students in the red group as r + 1, it will produce an incorrect output.
4. **Infinite loop.** The program may enter an infinite loop if it does not have a way to terminate. For example, if the program does not check if all students have ascended to the top of the mountain, it will continue to run forever.
5. **Memory leak.** The program may not release memory that it has allocated, which may eventually cause the program to crash. For example, if the program creates a new array for each group of students, it will not release the memory for the arrays when it is finished with them.

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correctly specified, which can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output. For example, if the input format is not specified as `int`, the program may crash when trying to read the number of inflorescences.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correctly specified, which can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output. For example, if the output format is not specified as `int`, the program may crash when trying to print the number of apples that Arcady will be able to collect.
* **Off-by-one errors:** Off-by-one errors can occur when the developer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. For example, if the developer forgets to increment the index of a loop variable, the program may skip over some of the elements in the list.
* **Incorrect logic:** The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program, which can lead to incorrect output. For example, the developer may incorrectly calculate the number of apples that Arcady will be able to collect.
* **Memory leaks:** The developer may not free up memory that is no longer needed, which can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
* **Race conditions:** Race conditions can occur when multiple threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect output or the program crashing.
* **Deadlocks:** Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, which can lead to the program being stuck in an infinite loop.

Title:
HACKEREARTH abhinav-and-manav

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect type conversion**. The input is a list of integers, but the code tries to convert it to a string. This will cause an error.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The code checks if the number is divisible by 11, but it should check if it is divisible by 10. This will cause the code to miss some of the correct answers.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code calculates the mirror image of a number by reversing the digits, but this is not correct. The correct way to calculate the mirror image is to subtract each digit from 9. This will cause the code to give incorrect answers.
4. **Uncaught exception**. The code throws an exception when it tries to divide by zero. This exception should be caught and handled appropriately.
5. **Memory leak**. The code allocates memory for a temporary variable, but it does not free the memory when it is finished with it. This will eventually cause the program to run out of memory.
6. **Security vulnerability**. The code does not properly check the input for malicious content. This could allow an attacker to exploit the code to gain unauthorized access to the system.

Title:
HACKEREARTH booboo-and-upsolving-circuits

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect variable type**

The problem statement mentions that the input contains two integers N and M. However, the code below incorrectly reads the input as a string. This will cause the program to crash when it tries to access the first element of the input string.

```
N, M = input().split()
```

The correct way to read the input is as follows:

```
N, M = map(int, input().split())
```

**2. Incorrect algorithm**

The following code incorrectly calculates the minimum time required to solve all the problems. It first calculates the total time required to solve all the problems, and then divides this time by the number of days to get the minimum time per day. However, this is incorrect because the total time required to solve all the problems may not be evenly divisible by the number of days.

```
total_time = sum(q_list)
min_time = total_time // M
```

The correct way to calculate the minimum time per day is to find the largest time that can be evenly divided by the number of days. This can be done using the following algorithm:

```
max_time = 0
for q in q_list:
    if q % M == 0:
        max_time = max(max_time, q)
return max_time // M
```

**3. Incorrect output format**

The problem statement specifies that the output should be a single integer. However, the following code incorrectly outputs a list of integers.

```
print(q_list)
```

The correct way to output the minimum time per day is as follows:

```
print(min_time)
```

**4. Missing error handling**

The following code does not handle the case where the input is invalid. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

```
try:
    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    q_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input")
```

The correct way to handle invalid input is to raise an exception. This will cause the program to stop and print an error message.

```
def main():
    try:
        N, M = map(int, input().split())
        q_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input")

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain a string instead of a number. The developer should check the input format and handle incorrect input gracefully.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correct. For example, the output may contain a float instead of an integer. The developer should check the output format and handle incorrect output gracefully.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may accidentally calculate the sum of the odd Fibonacci numbers instead of the even Fibonacci numbers. This can be avoided by carefully checking the logic of the program.
4. **Infinite loop**. The developer may accidentally create an infinite loop in the program. This can be avoided by using break statements to exit the loop when the desired condition is met.
5. **Memory leak**. The developer may accidentally create a memory leak in the program. This can be avoided by carefully managing the memory usage of the program.
6. **Stack overflow**. The developer may accidentally cause a stack overflow in the program. This can be avoided by using recursion carefully and ensuring that the recursion depth is limited.
7. **Arithmetic overflow**. The developer may accidentally cause an arithmetic overflow in the program. This can be avoided by using the correct data types and by carefully checking the results of arithmetic operations.

Title:
HACKEREARTH palindrome-check-2-1

Pain points:
1. **Using the wrong data type.** The input string is a string of lowercase English alphabets, so it should be stored as a string. If it is stored as a list or a tuple, the following problems may occur:
    * The program may not be able to compare the string to itself backwards.
    * The program may not be able to check if the string contains all the letters of the alphabet.
2. **Using the wrong algorithm.** The correct algorithm for checking if a string is a palindrome is to reverse the string and compare it to the original string. If the two strings are equal, then the string is a palindrome. If the two strings are not equal, then the string is not a palindrome.
3. **Using incorrect logic.** The logic for checking if a string is a palindrome is as follows:
    1. Reverse the string.
    2. Compare the reversed string to the original string.
    3. If the two strings are equal, then the string is a palindrome.
    4. If the two strings are not equal, then the string is not a palindrome.
4. **Not handling errors correctly.** The program should handle errors correctly. If the input string is not a string of lowercase English alphabets, the program should print an error message and exit.
5. **Not testing the program thoroughly.** The program should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly. The program should be tested with a variety of input strings, including strings that are palindromes and strings that are not palindromes.

Title:
HACKEREARTH rhezo-and-cinema-hall-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the constraints.** The constraints are not properly implemented, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is `N = 5`, `M = 10`, and `K = 2`, the correct answer is `1024`, but the incorrect implementation may return a smaller number.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of arrangements.** The number of arrangements can be calculated in a number of ways. One way is to use the following formula:

```
N! / (K! * (N - K)!)
```

where `N` is the number of rows, `M` is the number of columns, and `K` is the minimum number of people in each row. However, this formula is only valid if the number of rows and columns are the same. If the number of rows and columns are different, the formula must be modified.
3. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic.** When calculating the number of arrangements, it is important to use modulo arithmetic to ensure that the result is a valid integer. For example, if the input is `N = 5`, `M = 10`, and `K = 2`, the correct answer is `1024`, but the incorrect implementation may return `1025`.
4. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The number of arrangements can be very large, so it is important to handle overflow correctly. For example, if the input is `N = 1000`, `M = 1000`, and `K = 1000`, the correct answer is `1000! / (1000! * 0!)`, which is a very large number. If the implementation does not handle overflow correctly, it may return an incorrect result.
5. **Incorrect use of floating-point arithmetic.** Floating-point arithmetic is not always accurate, so it is important to use integer arithmetic whenever possible. For example, if the input is `N = 1000`, `M = 1000`, and `K = 1000`, the correct answer is `1000! / (1000! * 0!)`, which is a very large integer. If the implementation uses floating-point arithmetic, it may return an incorrect result.

## Possible problems

* **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not correctly parsed, which may result in incorrect results.
* **Incorrect use of `defaultdict`.** The `defaultdict` data structure is used to create a dictionary that automatically initializes missing keys with a default value. In this problem, the `defaultdict` is used to create a dictionary of lists, where each key is a tuple representing a special field and the value is a list of paths that contain that special field. However, the `defaultdict` is not initialized with a default value, which means that any key that does not exist in the dictionary will result in a `KeyError` exception.
* **Incorrect use of `dfs`.** The `dfs` function is used to recursively search for all paths from the starting point to the goal point. However, the `dfs` function does not check if the current path is valid. This can result in the function returning an incorrect answer.
* **Incorrect use of `dp`.** The `dp` array is used to store the number of paths that contain a certain number of special fields. However, the `dp` array is not initialized to zero, which means that the function will return incorrect results.

## Possible bugs

* **Off-by-one error.** The `dfs` function may incorrectly count the number of paths that contain a certain number of special fields. This can happen if the function does not correctly account for the fact that the starting point and the goal point are both special fields.
* **Infinite loop.** The `dfs` function may enter an infinite loop if it is called with a path that does not contain any special fields. This can happen if the function does not correctly check if the current path is valid.
* **Memory leak.** The `defaultdict` data structure may cause a memory leak if it is not properly cleaned up. This can happen if the function does not correctly delete the `defaultdict` after it is finished using it.

## How to avoid these problems

To avoid these problems, you should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand the input format and the output format. You should also carefully review the code for any potential errors. Here are some specific tips for avoiding these problems:

* Make sure that you correctly parse the input format.
* Initialize the `defaultdict` with a default value.
* Check if the current path is valid before calling the `dfs` function.
* Initialize the `dp` array to zero.
* Carefully review the code for any potential errors.

Title:
ATCODER p02708 AtCoder Beginner Contest 163 - Sum of Large Numbers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulo operation.** When computing the modulo of a large number, it is important to use the correct modulus. For example, if you are computing the modulo of a 64-bit number, you should use the modulus `2^64 - 1` instead of `10^9 + 7`.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When computing the number of possible values of a sum, it is important to make sure that you account for all possible values. For example, if you are computing the number of possible values of the sum of two numbers, you should include the value `0` as a possible value.
3. **Incorrect use of bit masks.** Bit masks can be a powerful tool for solving problems involving large numbers, but they can also be a source of errors. It is important to make sure that you use bit masks correctly. For example, if you are using a bit mask to represent a set of bits, you should make sure that you clear all of the bits that are not in the set.
4. **Incorrect use of bitwise operators.** Bitwise operators can be a powerful tool for solving problems involving large numbers, but they can also be a source of errors. It is important to make sure that you use bitwise operators correctly. For example, if you are using a bitwise operator to perform an AND operation, you should make sure that you are using the correct operands.
5. **Incorrect use of modular arithmetic.** Modular arithmetic can be a powerful tool for solving problems involving large numbers, but it can also be a source of errors. It is important to make sure that you use modular arithmetic correctly. For example, if you are computing the remainder of a division operation, you should make sure that you are using the correct modulus.

Pain points:
1. The input format is not very clear. It is not obvious that the input is a list of pairs of numbers and strings.
2. The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input is invalid. For example, if the input contains a string that is not "JPY" or "BTC", the program will crash.
3. The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input contains a number that is not a valid integer or a decimal number with 8 decimal digits. For example, if the input contains a number that is greater than 10^8 or less than 0, the program will crash.
4. The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input contains a number that is not a multiple of 380000. For example, if the input contains a number that is 0.00000001 BTC, the program will crash.
5. The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input contains a number that is not a valid Japanese yen amount. For example, if the input contains a number that is greater than 10^8, the program will crash.
6. The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input contains a number that is not a valid bitcoin amount. For example, if the input contains a number that is greater than 100.00000000 BTC, the program will crash.
7. The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input contains a number that is not a valid exchange rate. For example, if the input contains a number that is not 380000.0 JPY per 1.0 BTC, the program will crash.
8. The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input contains a number that is not a valid total amount of money. For example, if the input contains a number that is greater than 10^10, the program will crash.
9. The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input contains a number that is not a valid number of relatives. For example, if the input contains a number that is less than 2 or greater than 10, the program will crash.

ATCODER p03257 AtCoder Grand Contest 027 - Modulo Matrix

Pain points:
1. **The input may not be valid.** For example, the input `2` is not valid because `N` must be at least 2.
2. **The output may not be correct.** For example, the output `1 2
3 4` does not satisfy the condition that `a_{i,j}` are pairwise distinct integers.
3. **The program may not run in time.** For example, the following program will not run in time for large values of `N`:
```
for i in range(N):
    for j in range(N):
        print(i + j + 1, end=" ")
    print()
```
4. **The program may not be memory efficient.** For example, the following program will use a lot of memory for large values of `N`:
```
a = [[0] * N for _ in range(N)]
for i in range(N):
    for j in range(N):
        a[i][j] = i + j + 1
```
5. **The program may not be thread safe.** For example, the following program is not thread safe because it uses a global variable `a`:
```
def f(i):
    global a
    for j in range(N):
        a[i][j] = i + j + 1

for i in range(N):
    f(i)
```
6. **The program may not be secure.** For example, the following program is not secure because it allows users to input arbitrary data:
```
import sys

N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
a = [[0] * N for _ in range(N)]
for i in range(N):
    for j in range(N):
        a[i][j] = int(sys.stdin.readline())
```
7. **The program may not be robust.** For example, the following program is not robust because it will crash if the input is invalid:
```
try:
    N = int(input())
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input")
```

1. **Incorrect variable type**. The problem states that the input is three integers, but the code below uses `str` to read the input. This will cause the program to crash.

```python
A, B, C = input().split()
```

2. **Incorrect comparison operator**. The problem states that two of the numbers are the same, but the code below uses `==` to compare the numbers. This will cause the program to output the wrong answer.

Title:
ATCODER p03728 AtCoder Grand Contest 014 - Strange Sorting

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The algorithm described in the problem statement is not trivial to implement correctly. One common mistake is to incorrectly define the high and low elements in the permutation. For example, the following code would incorrectly identify the elements 2 and 4 as high elements in the permutation (1, 2, 4, 3):

```
def is_high_element(i, p):
  """Returns True if the i-th element in the permutation p is high."""

  if i == 0:
    return True
  return p[i] > p[i - 1]


def solve(n, p):
  """Returns the number of operations necessary to sort the permutation p."""

  # Initialize the number of operations to 0.

  operations = 0

  # Iterate over the elements in the permutation, from left to right.

  for i in range(n):
    # If the i-th element is high, then increment the number of operations.

    if is_high_element(i, p):
      operations += 1

  # Return the number of operations.

  return operations
```

A correct implementation of the algorithm would check if the maximum element between the 1-st and i-th elements, inclusive, is the i-th element itself. For example, the following code would correctly identify the elements 1 and 3 as high elements in the permutation (1, 2, 4, 3):

```
def is_high_element(i, p):
  """Returns True if the i-th element in the permutation p is high."""

  if i == 0:
    return True
  return p[i] > max(p[0:i])
```

**2. Incorrect use of data structures**

Another common mistake is to incorrectly use data structures in the implementation of the algorithm. For example, the following code would incorrectly use a list to store the high and low elements in the permutation:

```
def solve(n, p):
  """Returns the number of operations necessary to sort the permutation p."""

  # Initialize the number of operations to 0.

  operations = 0

  # Create a list to store the high and low elements in the permutation.

  high_elements = []
  low_elements = []

  # Iterate over the elements in the permutation, from left to right.

  for i in range(n):
    # If the i-th element is high, then add it to the list of high elements.

    if is_high_element(i, p):
      high_elements.append(p[i])
    # Otherwise, add it to the list of low elements.

    else:
      low_elements.append(p[i])

  # Rearrange the permutation into (b_1,b_2,...,b_{N-k},a_1,a_2,...,a_k).

  for i in range(len(high_elements)):
    p[i] = high_elements[i]
  for i in range(len(low_elements)):
    p[i + len(high_elements)] = low_elements[i]

  # Return the number of operations.

  return operations
```

A correct implementation of the algorithm would use a deque to store the high and low elements in the permutation. This would allow the elements to be efficiently added and removed from the front and back of the list, which is necessary for the algorithm to work correctly.

**3. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

Another common mistake is to incorrectly handle edge cases in the implementation of the algorithm. For example, the following code would incorrectly handle the case where the permutation is already sorted:

```
def solve(n, p):
  """Returns the number of operations necessary to sort the permutation p."""

  # Initialize the number of operations to 0.

  operations = 0

  # Iterate over the elements in the permutation, from left to right.

  for i in range(n):
    # If the i-th element is not equal to i + 1, then increment the number of operations.

    if p[i] != i + 1:
      operations += 1

  # Return the number of operations.

  return operations
```

A correct implementation of the algorithm would check if the permutation is already

Title:
ATCODER p03892 CODE FESTIVAL 2016 Relay (Parallel) - Segment on Grid Paper

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect calculation of the number of squares crossed**

The most common mistake is to incorrectly calculate the number of squares crossed. The number of squares crossed is equal to the absolute value of the difference between the x-coordinates of the two endpoints plus the absolute value of the difference between the y-coordinates of the two endpoints. For example, if the two endpoints are (1, 1) and (3, 4), then the number of squares crossed is 3 + 3 = 6.

**2. Using incorrect data types**

Another common mistake is to use incorrect data types. The input values are all integers, so they should be stored as integers. If they are stored as floating-point numbers, the calculations will be incorrect.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are another common mistake. For example, if you are counting the number of elements in a list, you might accidentally start counting at index 0 instead of index 1. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**4. Using incorrect formulas**

Another common mistake is to use incorrect formulas. For example, if you are trying to calculate the area of a circle, you might accidentally use the formula for the circumference of a circle. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**5. Not handling special cases correctly**

Special cases are cases that are not handled by the general solution. For example, if you are trying to divide by zero, you need to handle that case separately. If you do not handle special cases correctly, your code will not work correctly in all cases.

Title:
ATCODER p04051 AtCoder Grand Contest 001 - BBQ Hard

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 returns 1, because 10 / 3 has a remainder of 1. However, if you are not careful, you could accidentally use the division operator (/) instead of the modulo operator, which would give you the wrong answer.
2. **Incorrect use of the factorial function.** The factorial function (n!) is the product of all the integers from 1 to n. For example, 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120. However, if you are not careful, you could accidentally use the product operator (*) instead of the factorial operator, which would give you the wrong answer.
3. **Incorrect use of the permutation function.** The permutation function (nPr) is the number of ways to arrange n distinct objects in a row r at a time. For example, 5P2 = 5! / 3! = 10. However, if you are not careful, you could accidentally use the combination function (nCr) instead of the permutation function, which would give you the wrong answer.
4. **Incorrect use of the combination function.** The combination function (nCr) is the number of ways to choose r distinct objects from a set of n distinct objects. For example, 5C2 = 5! / 2! / 3! = 10. However, if you are not careful, you could accidentally use the permutation function (nPr) instead of the combination function, which would give you the wrong answer.
5. **Incorrect use of the Catalan number.** The Catalan number (Cn) is the number of ways to draw n non-intersecting chords in a circle. For example, C4 = 5. However, if you are not careful, you could accidentally use the wrong formula for the Catalan number, which would give you the wrong answer.
6. **Incorrect use of the Fibonacci number.** The Fibonacci number (Fn) is the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. For example, F0 = 0, F1 = 1, and F2 = 1. However, if you are not careful, you could accidentally use the wrong formula for the Fibonacci number, which would give you the wrong answer.
7. **Incorrect use of the Lucas number.** The Lucas number (Ln) is the nth number in the Lucas sequence. For example, L0 = 2, L1 = 1, and L2 = 3. However, if you are not careful, you could accidentally use the wrong formula for the Lucas number, which would give you the wrong answer.
8. **Incorrect use of the prime factorization.** The prime factorization of a number is the product of all its prime factors. For example, the prime factorization of 12 is 2 * 2 * 3. However, if you are not careful, you could accidentally use the wrong method to find the prime factorization of a number, which would give you the wrong answer.
9. **Incorrect use of the sieve of Eratosthenes.** The sieve of Eratosthenes is a method for finding all the prime numbers up to a given integer. However, if you are not careful, you could accidentally use the wrong method to implement the sieve of Eratosthenes, which would give you the wrong answer.
10. **Incorrect use of the extended Euclidean algorithm.** The extended Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. However, if you are not careful, you could accidentally use the wrong method to implement the extended Euclidean algorithm, which would give you the wrong answer.

where `Q` is the number of bit strings and `si` is the i-th bit string. However, the input format may be incorrect. For example, the following input is incorrect:

```
Q
s1s2
```

In this case, the program should raise an error.

**2. Incorrect bit string**

The bit string should be a 32-bit string. However, the input bit string may be incorrect. For example, the following input is incorrect:

```
Q

AIZU p00641 Huge Family

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the family plan.** The family plan is such that when a chooses b, and b chooses a as a partner, a family plan can be applied between them and then the calling fee per unit time between them discounted to f(a, b), which is cheaper than a default fee. However, some implementations may incorrectly implement the family plan such that the calling fee per unit time between a and b is not discounted if b does not choose a as a partner. This would result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the clan.** The clan is defined as a subset of all phone calls that family plan is applied such that for any two persons (let them be i and j), if i can send a message to j through phone calls that family plan is applied (directly or indirectly), then i can send a message to j through only phone calls in S (directly or indirectly). However, some implementations may incorrectly implement the clan such that it does not satisfy this condition. This would result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm for finding the number of clans.** The algorithm for finding the number of clans is a dynamic programming algorithm. Some implementations may incorrectly implement this algorithm, resulting in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect implementation of the modulo operation.** The answer to the problem is modulo 10007. Some implementations may incorrectly implement the modulo operation, resulting in an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect input handling.** The input to the problem may be incorrect. Some implementations may incorrectly handle incorrect input, resulting in an incorrect answer.
6. **Incorrect output handling.** The output to the problem must be modulo 10007. Some implementations may incorrectly handle the output, resulting in an incorrect answer.

Pain points:
1. The input format is not very clear. It is not obvious that the first line is the width of the reservation table, and that the subsequent lines represent the reservation table for each function unit.
2. The problem statement does not specify what happens if two tasks conflict at the same clock cycle. For example, if two tasks both need unit0 at clock 0, is it allowed to start both tasks?
3. The problem statement does not specify what happens if a task is started at a clock cycle where no function units are available. For example, if a task needs unit0 at clock 0, but unit0 is not available at clock 0, is it allowed to start the task?
4. The problem statement does not specify how to handle tasks that are already in the pipeline when a new task arrives. For example, if there is a task already in the pipeline that needs unit0 at clock 0, and a new task arrives that also needs unit0 at clock 0, what should happen?
5. The problem statement does not specify how to handle tasks that are completed before the end of the pipeline. For example, if a task is completed at clock 5, but the pipeline is 7 clock cycles long, what should happen?
6. The problem statement does not specify how to handle tasks that are started at the same clock cycle but finish at different clock cycles. For example, if two tasks are started at clock 0, and one task finishes at clock 5, and the other task finishes at clock 7, what should happen?

2. **Incorrect calculation**. The program may calculate the time incorrectly. For example, the program may calculate the time as 0:0:0 when the input is 12:0:0.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed. For example, the output may not contain four non-negative integers separated by a space.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The program may output the wrong time by one second, one minute, or one hour.
5. **Infinite loop**. The program may get stuck in an infinite loop. This can happen if the program is not properly terminated.
6. **Memory leak**. The program may leak memory. This can happen if the program does not properly free the memory that it has allocated.

AIZU p01050 String Compression

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect character encoding**. The input string may contain characters that are not in the ASCII character set. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect handling of invalid input**. The input string may be empty or contain invalid characters. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect use of pointers**. Pointers can be used to access memory that is not allocated to the program. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect use of dynamic memory**. Dynamic memory is memory that is allocated during runtime. If the program does not free up dynamic memory that is no longer needed, it can eventually run out of memory and crash.
5. **Incorrect use of recursion**. Recursion can be a powerful tool, but it can also be dangerous if it is not used correctly. Recursion can cause a program to stack overflow and crash.
6. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers**. Floating-point numbers can be imprecise, which can lead to incorrect results.
7. **Incorrect use of multithreading**. Multithreading can be a powerful tool, but it can also be dangerous if it is not used correctly. Multithreading can cause a program to deadlock or produce incorrect output.
8. **Incorrect use of synchronization**. Synchronization is used to ensure that multiple threads do not access shared data at the same time. If synchronization is not used correctly, it can lead to data corruption or incorrect results.
9. **Incorrect use of exceptions**. Exceptions are used to handle errors that occur during runtime. If exceptions are not used correctly, it can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
10. **Incorrect use of unit tests**. Unit tests are used to test individual units of code. If unit tests are not written correctly, they can give false confidence that the code is correct.

Possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem statement is quite long and detailed, so it is important to read it carefully and make sure that you understand all of the requirements. One common mistake is to assume that the locks are always open, when in fact they can be closed for maintenance or other reasons. Another common mistake is to forget that the ships can only enter the locks when the water level on the west side is equal to the water level in the lock chamber.
* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for solving this problem is quite complex, so it is important to make sure that you implement it correctly. One common mistake is to forget to update the water levels in the locks after each ship passes through. Another common mistake is to forget to check if the ships are allowed to enter the locks.
* **Incorrect testing.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. One common mistake is to only test your solution on small input values. Another common mistake is to only test your solution on cases where the ships are all moving in the same direction.

Here are some specific examples of problems that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer might incorrectly assume that the locks are always open. This would lead to the developer not checking if the locks are closed for maintenance or other reasons. This could result in the developer's solution not working correctly.
* The developer might forget that the ships can only enter the locks when the water level on the west side is equal to the water level in the lock chamber. This would lead to the developer's solution not allowing ships to enter the locks when they should be able to. This could result in the developer's solution not working correctly.
* The developer might forget to update the water levels in the locks after each ship passes through. This would lead to the developer's solution not correctly calculating the time it takes for the ships to cross the river. This could result in the developer's solution not working correctly.
* The developer might forget to check if the ships are allowed to enter the locks. This would lead to the developer's solution allowing ships to enter the locks when they should not be able to. This could result in the developer's solution not working correctly.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
AIZU p01487 RabbitWalking

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is `N M`, where `N` is the number of cells in the grid and `M` is the number of edges. If the input format is incorrect, the developer may get a `SyntaxError` or a `ValueError`.
2. **Incorrect edge format.** The edge format is `A B`, where `A` and `B` are the indices of the cells that are connected by the edge. If the edge format is incorrect, the developer may get a `ValueError`.
3. **Out-of-bounds access.** The cells in the grid are indexed from 0 to `N - 1`. If the developer tries to access a cell that is out of bounds, the developer may get a `IndexError`.
4. **Incorrect graph traversal.** The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to traverse the graph, which may result in a incorrect answer.
5. **Memory leak.** The developer may not free up memory that is allocated during the execution of the program, which may lead to a memory leak.
6. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is the length of the shortest path from cell 1 to cell `N`. If the developer does not print the output in the correct format, the grader may not be able to correctly evaluate the solution.

Title:
AIZU p01934 Dimension travel

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable names.** The variable names used in the code should be descriptive and easy to understand. For example, instead of using `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `n`, `s`, and `t`, the variables could be named `dimension`, `current_dimension`, `target_dimension`, `number_of_magics`, `magic_index`, `source_dimension`, and `target_dimension`, respectively.
2. **Incorrect data types.** The data types used in the code should be appropriate for the values they store. For example, the variable `number_of_magics` should be of type `int` because it stores an integer value.
3. **Incorrect operators.** The operators used in the code should be correct for the operations being performed. For example, the operator `+` should be used to add two numbers, and the operator `*` should be used to multiply two numbers.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The logic used in the code should be correct. For example, the code should correctly calculate the minimum total damage inflicted when AOR Ika moves from the source dimension to the target dimension.
5. **Incorrect indentation.** The code should be properly indented to make it easy to read.
6. **Incorrect comments.** The comments in the code should be informative and should explain what the code is doing.
7. **Incorrect formatting.** The code should be formatted correctly to make it easy to read.
8. **Incorrect error handling.** The code should handle errors gracefully. For example, the code should handle the case where the user inputs invalid data.
9. **Incorrect testing.** The code should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it is working correctly.
10. **Incorrect documentation.** The code should be well-documented to make it easy for other developers to understand how it works.

Title:
AIZU p02215 Xor Array

Pain points:
**1. Off-by-one error**

The problem states that the sequence is a monotonous increase in a broad sense, which means that the elements can be equal. However, many solutions will check if the next element is strictly greater than the previous element, which will lead to an off-by-one error.

**2. Incorrect modulo operation**

The problem states that the answer should be the remainder when divided by 998244353. However, many solutions will simply divide the answer by 998244353, which will give the wrong answer.

**3. Incorrect use of factorials**

The problem states that the number of sequences of length $N$ that satisfy the given conditions is given by the following formula:

$$
\frac{X!}{(X-N)!}
$$

However, many solutions will use the following formula instead:

$$
\frac{(X+N-1)!}{(X-1)!}
$$

This will lead to an incorrect answer.

**4. Incorrect use of binomial coefficients**

The problem states that the number of sequences of length $N$ that satisfy the given conditions is given by the following formula:

$$
\binom{X+N-1}{N-1}
$$

However, many solutions will use the following formula instead:

$$
\binom{X+N-1}{N}
$$

This will lead to an incorrect answer.

**5. Incorrect use of Euler's theorem**

The problem states that the number of sequences of length $N$ that satisfy the given conditions is given by the following formula:

$$
\phi(X+N)
$$

where $\phi$ is Euler's totient function. However, many solutions will use the following formula instead:

$$
X+N
$$

This will lead to an incorrect answer.

Title:
AIZU p02368 Strongly Connected Components

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly handling the input data.** The input data may be incorrect, such as containing invalid values or not being in the correct format. The developer must ensure that the input data is valid before attempting to solve the problem.
2. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem, and the developer must choose the correct algorithm for the given data set. The developer must also ensure that the algorithm is implemented correctly.
3. **Making a mistake in the implementation.** Even if the developer chooses the correct algorithm and implements it correctly, they may still make a mistake in the implementation. The developer must carefully check their code for errors before running it.
4. **Not handling all possible cases.** The developer must ensure that their solution handles all possible cases, such as graphs with cycles or graphs with no edges.
5. **Not optimizing the solution.** The developer can improve the performance of their solution by optimizing it for the given data set. This may involve using more efficient data structures or algorithms, or parallelizing the computation.
