Title:
CODECHEF caos1

Pain points:
Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly computing the minimum of [L, R, T, B].** This is a common mistake that can be made when iterating over the cells in a grid. It is important to remember that the minimum of a set of numbers is the smallest number in the set. For example, the minimum of the set {1, 2, 3} is 1.
* **Not considering cells that are not walls.** The problem statement states that a monster exists in a cell if the cell is not a wall and the cell is a CPC. It is important to make sure that you are only considering cells that are not walls when computing the minimum of [L, R, T, B].
* **Not checking if a cell is a CPC.** The problem statement states that a cell is a CPC if there exists a prime number P such that P ≤ minimum of [L, R, T, B]. It is important to make sure that you are checking if a cell is a CPC before determining whether or not it contains a monster.
* **Incorrectly counting the number of cells that contain monsters.** This is a common mistake that can be made when iterating over the cells in a grid. It is important to make sure that you are only counting the cells that contain monsters when computing the output of the program.

Here are some additional tips that may help you avoid these problems and bugs:

* Use a test suite to verify that your program is working correctly. A test suite is a set of test cases that can be used to check that your program is producing the correct output.
* Use a debugger to help you track down errors in your program. A debugger is a tool that can help you identify the line of code that is causing an error.
* Ask for help from other programmers. If you are stuck on a problem, don't be afraid to ask for help from other programmers. There are many online forums and communities where you can get help with programming problems.

CODECHEF crace

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The variable `n` should be an integer, but it is a string in the following code:

```
n = input()
```

2. **Incorrect operator**. The operator `<=` should be used instead of `==` in the following code:

```
if n % 3 == 0 or n % 5 == 0 or n % 15 == 0:
```

3. **Incorrect logic**. The following code is incorrect:

```
if n % 3 == 0 or n % 5 == 0 or n % 15 == 0:
    print("JENNY")
else:
    print("JACK")
```

The correct code should be:

```
if n % 3 == 0 or n % 5 == 0 or n % 15 == 0:
    print("JENNY")
else:
    print("JACK")
```

Title:
CODECHEF graysc

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a sequence of non-negative integers. If the developer uses the wrong data type, such as `int` or `short`, the program may not be able to handle large integers and will produce incorrect results.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a simple algorithm. However, if the developer uses a more complex algorithm, such as a sorting algorithm, the program may run slower than necessary.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement specifies that the input data is a sequence of non-negative integers. However, the developer may not handle edge cases, such as a sequence with zero elements or a sequence with negative elements. This can lead to incorrect results or a runtime error.

**4. Using incorrect logic**

The problem statement specifies that the input data is a sequence of non-negative integers such that every two adjacent integers have exactly one different digit in their binary representation. The developer must use this information to correctly solve the problem.

**5. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. The developer should test the code with a variety of input data, including both valid and invalid data. This will help to identify any bugs in the code and ensure that it is correct.

CODECHEF maxgame

Pain points:
**Possible Problems**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the modulo operator.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. Make sure that you are using the correct modulo operator for your programming language.
2. **Incorrect handling of overflows.** When dealing with large numbers, it is important to be careful to avoid overflows. This can happen when you add, subtract, or multiply two large numbers.
3. **Incorrect use of recursion.** Recursion can be a powerful tool, but it is important to use it correctly. Make sure that you understand the base case and the recursive case of your function.
4. **Incorrect use of dynamic programming.** Dynamic programming can be a very efficient way to solve problems, but it is important to use it correctly. Make sure that you understand the subproblems and the optimal substructure property of your problem.
5. **Incorrect use of memoization.** Memoization can be a very efficient way to speed up a recursive algorithm, but it is important to use it correctly. Make sure that you understand the memoization table and the update function.

**Possible Bugs**

1. **Off-by-one errors.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. Make sure that you are counting the number of elements correctly.
2. **Incorrect use of pointers.** Pointers can be a powerful tool, but they are also easy to misuse. Make sure that you understand the difference between a pointer and a reference.
3. **Incorrect use of arrays.** Arrays can be a very efficient way to store data, but they are also easy to misuse. Make sure that you understand the bounds of your arrays.
4. **Incorrect use of strings.** Strings can be a very efficient way to store text data, but they are also easy to misuse. Make sure that you understand the different ways to create and manipulate strings.
5. **Incorrect use of files.** Files can be a very efficient way to read and write data, but they are also easy to misuse. Make sure that you understand the different ways to open, read, and write files.

Title:
CODECHEF rbtree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the red-black tree data structure.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. The red-black tree is a special type of binary tree that has the following properties:
    * Each node is either red or black.
    * The root node is black.
    * The children of a red node are both black.
    * Every path from the root node to a leaf node contains the same number of black nodes.

If the developer does not implement the red-black tree data structure correctly, then the tree will not have the correct properties and the algorithm will not work correctly.
2. **Incorrect handling of queries.** The queries in this problem can be of three types:
    * `Qi`: Change the color of all red nodes to black and all black nodes to red.
    * `Qb`: Count the number of black nodes on the path from node `x` to node `y` (both inclusive).
    * `Qr`: Count the number of red nodes on the path from node `x` to node `y` (both inclusive).

If the developer does not handle these queries correctly, then the algorithm will not work correctly.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of black nodes on a path.** The number of black nodes on a path from node `x` to node `y` can be calculated using the following formula:

```
black_nodes = 1 + black_nodes(x) + black_nodes(y) - 2 * black_nodes(lca(x, y))
```

where `black_nodes(x)` is the number of black nodes in the subtree rooted at node `x`, `black_nodes(y)` is the number of black nodes in the subtree rooted at node `y`, and `lca(x, y)` is the lowest common ancestor of nodes `x` and `y`.

If the developer does not calculate the number of black nodes correctly, then the algorithm will not work correctly.

4. **Incorrect calculation of the number of red nodes on a path.** The number of red nodes on a path from node `x` to node `y` can be calculated using the following formula:

```
red_nodes = black_nodes - 1
```

where `black_nodes` is the number of black nodes on the path from node `x` to node `y`.

If the developer does not calculate the number of red nodes correctly, then the algorithm will not work correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1039_D. You Are Given a Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the DFS algorithm.** The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that can be used to traverse a graph. It works by starting at a given vertex and recursively visiting all of its adjacent vertices. However, if the implementation of the DFS algorithm is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the algorithm does not properly handle cycles in the graph, it may miss some vertices or visit them multiple times.
2. **Incorrect use of the visited array.** The visited array is a data structure that is used to keep track of which vertices have already been visited by the DFS algorithm. If the visited array is not used correctly, it can lead to incorrect results. For example, if a vertex is visited multiple times, the algorithm may incorrectly count it as being part of multiple paths.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of paths.** The maximum number of paths in a k-valid set of simple paths is equal to the number of vertices in the tree that are not part of any paths of length less than k. However, if the calculation of this number is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the algorithm does not properly account for the fact that some vertices may be part of multiple paths, it may overestimate the maximum number of paths.
4. **Incorrect output of the results.** The output of the program should be a list of n integers, where the i-th integer is the maximum number of paths in an i-valid set of paths. However, if the output is incorrect, it can lead to the program being incorrect. For example, if the output is not a list of integers, it may not be possible to parse it correctly.
5. **Other errors.** There are a number of other errors that can occur when solving this problem. These errors include incorrect data type conversions, off-by-one errors, and logical errors. It is important to be aware of these errors and to take steps to avoid them.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1061_F. Lost Root

Pain points:
  **1. Using the wrong data type for the number of nodes or the value of k.**
   
   The input format specifies that the number of nodes and the value of k should be integers. If you accidentally use a floating-point type for either of these values, your program will likely crash.
   
   **2. Making too many queries.**
   
   The interaction protocol specifies that you are only allowed to make 60 * n queries. If you exceed this limit, your program will receive a verdict of "Wrong Answer".
   
   **3. Forgetting to flush the output after each query.**
   
   As the interaction protocol specifies, you must flush the output after each query. If you forget to do this, your program may receive an "Idleness limit exceeded" error.
   
   **4. Not printing the answer in the correct format.**
   
   The interaction protocol specifies that the answer must be printed in the format "! s", where s is the label of the root vertex. If you do not print the answer in this format, your program will receive a verdict of "Wrong Answer".
   
   **5. Using the wrong algorithm to find the root of the tree.**
   
   There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to find the root of a tree. If you use the wrong algorithm, your program may not find the correct answer.
   
   **6. Making a mistake in your implementation of the algorithm.**
   
   Even if you use the correct algorithm, you may still make a mistake in your implementation. This could be due to a typo, a logical error, or a misunderstanding of the algorithm.
   
   To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and the interaction protocol. You should also test your program thoroughly before submitting it.
Test inputs:
1. **Using the wrong data type for the number of nodes or the value of k.**

```
n, k = int(input()), int(input())
```

2. **Making too many queries.**

```
for i in range(60 * n):
    print('?', input(), input(), input())
```

3. **Forgetting to flush the output after each query.**

```
print('?', input(), input(), input())
# This will cause an "Idleness limit exceeded" error.
```

```
print('?', input(), input(), input())
print()
```

4. **Not printing the answer in the correct format.**

```
print('!', 1)
```

5. **Using the wrong algorithm to find the root of the tree.**

```
def find_root(n, k):
    # This algorithm will not work for all trees.
    for i in range(n):
        if i not in [1, n - 1]:
            return i
```

6. **Making a mistake in your implementation of the algorithm.**

```
def find_root(n, k):
    # This algorithm will not work for all trees.
    for i in range(n):
        if i not in [1, n - 1]:
            return i

print(find_root(3, 2))
```

This program will return 1, which is not the root of the tree.

CODEFORCES 1103_A. Grid game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly handling the input data.** The input data may contain invalid characters or may not be in the correct format. The developer must make sure to check the input data for errors and handle them appropriately.
2. **Incorrectly implementing the game rules.** The game rules may be complex, and the developer must make sure to implement them correctly. For example, the developer must make sure to correctly handle the case when a tile is placed in a row or column that is already full.
3. **Incorrectly computing the output.** The output must be in the correct format and must contain the correct information. For example, the output must contain two positive integers representing the row and column of the tile.
4. **Using incorrect data structures or algorithms.** The developer must choose the correct data structures and algorithms to solve the problem efficiently. For example, the developer may need to use a priority queue to keep track of the tiles that need to be placed.
5. **Making incorrect assumptions about the input data.** The developer must make sure to not make any incorrect assumptions about the input data. For example, the developer must not assume that the input data will always be valid.
6. **Not testing the code thoroughly.** The developer must test the code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct and works as expected. For example, the developer should test the code with different input data and different scenarios.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1131_A. Sea Battle

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one errors.** The most common bug when dealing with 2D arrays is off-by-one errors. This occurs when you accidentally access an element that is one index off from the intended element. For example, if you are trying to access the element at index [i, j], you might accidentally access the element at index [i + 1, j] or [i, j + 1]. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Indexing out of bounds.** Another common bug when dealing with 2D arrays is indexing out of bounds. This occurs when you try to access an element that is outside the bounds of the array. For example, if you have an array with 10 rows and 10 columns, and you try to access the element at index [11, 11], this will cause an error.
3. **Memory leaks.** When you allocate memory for a 2D array, it is important to free that memory when you are finished with it. If you do not free the memory, you will create a memory leak. This can eventually lead to your program running out of memory and crashing.
4. **Synchronization issues.** When multiple threads are accessing the same 2D array, it is important to use synchronization to ensure that the data is accessed and modified in a consistent manner. If you do not use synchronization, you may encounter race conditions, which can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Invalid input.** When reading input for a 2D array, it is important to validate the input to ensure that it is in the correct format. If you do not validate the input, you may encounter errors when trying to access the array.
6. **Inefficient algorithms.** When you are working with 2D arrays, it is important to use efficient algorithms to avoid performance problems. For example, if you are iterating over a 2D array, you should use a nested for loop instead of a single for loop.

3. **Incorrect lexicographical comparison**. The lexicographical comparison of strings is performed by the `<` operator in the modern programming languages. String `x` is lexicographically less than string `y` either if `x` is a prefix of `y`, or exists such `i` (1 ≤ `i` ≤ min(|`x`|, |`y`|)), that `x[i] < y[i]` and for any `j` (1 ≤ `j` < `i`) `x[j] = y[j]`. Here `|a|` denotes the length of string `a`.
4. **Incorrect solution**. The solution may not find the lexicographically minimum lucky number that is contained in the input string as a substring the maximum number of times.

CODEFORCES 1270_H. Number of Components

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect implementation of the union-find data structure.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. Make sure that you understand the algorithm and implement it correctly.
* **Incorrect handling of queries.** Make sure that you correctly update the data structure after each query.
* **Incorrect calculation of the weight of the array.** This is a simple mistake that can be easily avoided by carefully reading the problem statement.
* **Time complexity.** The time complexity of your solution should be O(n + q), where n is the size of the array and q is the number of queries.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* **Test your code thoroughly.** This is the best way to find bugs in your code. Make sure to test your code on a variety of inputs, including both small and large inputs.
* **Use a debugger.** A debugger can help you to track down bugs in your code. This is especially helpful if you are not sure where the bug is located.
* **Ask for help from others.** If you are stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help from others. There are many online resources available, such as forums and chat rooms.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1293_F. Chaotic V.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of integers. However, if the input data contains a non-integer value, the program will crash. For example, if the input data is `"3\n2 1 4"`, the program will crash because the second element of the input data is a string.

**2. Incorrect format**

The input data should be a list of integers, separated by a newline character. However, if the input data is not formatted correctly, the program will crash. For example, if the input data is `"3\n21 14"`, the program will crash because the second element of the input data is not separated by a newline character.

**3. Incorrect calculation**

The program should calculate the minimum sum of paths' lengths from every fragment to the emotion samples' assembly node. However, if the program calculates the wrong answer, the output will be incorrect. For example, if the input data is `"3\n2 1 4"` and the output is `"6"`, the output is incorrect because the correct answer is `5`.

**4. Runtime error**

The program should run within a reasonable amount of time. However, if the program takes too long to run, it will be timed out. For example, if the input data is `"1000000\n999999"`, the program will be timed out because it takes too long to calculate the minimum sum of paths' lengths.

**5. Memory error**

The program should not use too much memory. However, if the program uses too much memory, it will run out of memory and crash. For example, if the input data is `"1000000\n999999"`, the program will run out of memory because it needs to store the list of integers in memory.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correct. For example, the output `1 2` is not correct because it does not have one integer.
3. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input or output is incorrect. For example, the input `1 2` is not correct because the first integer is not a string.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The code is correct but it outputs the wrong answer because of an off-by-one error. For example, the code might output `1` instead of `2` because it forgot to add one to the answer.
5. **Incorrect algorithm**. The code is incorrect because it uses an incorrect algorithm. For example, the code might use a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem, which is not efficient.
6. **Runtime error**. The code does not run correctly because of a runtime error. For example, the code might run out of memory or crash.
7. **Memory leak**. The code leaks memory because it does not free up the memory that it allocates. This can eventually lead to a runtime error.
8. **Security vulnerability**. The code has a security vulnerability because it does not properly validate user input. This can allow attackers to exploit the code and gain access to the system.
9. **Incorrect comments**. The comments in the code are incorrect or misleading. This can make it difficult to understand the code and debug it.

CODEFORCES 1336_C. Kaavi and Magic Spell

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect calculation of the number of operations.** The number of operations is equal to the length of the string S minus the length of the string T. This is because each operation deletes the first character of S and adds it to A. So, if S has length 10 and T has length 5, the number of operations is 10 - 5 = 5.
2. Incorrect calculation of the modulo. The modulo operation is used to ensure that the answer is a whole number. This is because the number of operations can be very large, and it is not possible to represent all of these numbers in a computer. The modulo operation ensures that the answer is always less than or equal to the modulus, which is 998244353 in this case.
3. Incorrect use of the factorial function. The factorial function is used to calculate the number of ways to arrange a set of objects. In this problem, the set of objects is the set of characters in the string S. The factorial function is calculated as n! = n * (n - 1) * ... * 2 * 1.
4. Incorrect use of the binomial coefficient. The binomial coefficient is used to calculate the number of ways to choose k objects from a set of n objects. In this problem, the set of objects is the set of characters in the string S. The binomial coefficient is calculated as nCr = n! / (k! * (n - k)!).
5. Incorrect use of the Catalan number. The Catalan number is used to calculate the number of ways to draw a Dyck path of length n. In this problem, a Dyck path is a path that starts at the origin and consists of only up and down steps. The Catalan number is calculated as Cn = (2n)! / (n! * (n + 1)!).

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements. It is also important to double-check your calculations to ensure that they are correct.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer t, which is the number of test cases. However, if the input contains more than one integer on the first line, or if it contains a non-integer value, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that each test case should contain three integers a, b, and c, separated by spaces. However, if the output contains more than three integers, or if it contains any non-integer values, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect calculation of a, b, and c.** The program must calculate a, b, and c such that l ≤ a, b, c ≤ r and n ⋅ a + b - c = m. However, if the program calculates values that do not satisfy these constraints, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** The program must be careful to account for the fact that the values of a, b, and c can be equal to l or r. If the program does not account for this possibility, the output will be incorrect.
5. **Infinite loops.** The program must not enter an infinite loop. If the program does enter an infinite loop, it will crash.

CODEFORCES 1468_E. Four Segments

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable types**. The problem statement specifies that the input should be integers, but the code below uses floats. This will cause the program to crash when it tries to compare two floats that are not equal.
2. **Incorrect variable initialization**. The code below initializes the variable `max_area` to a value of `0`. This means that the program will never find the maximum area of the rectangle, because it will always be less than or equal to `0`.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code below uses the following logic to find the maximum area of the rectangle:

```
for i in range(4):
    for j in range(i + 1, 4):
        max_area = max(max_area, a[i] * a[j])
```

This logic is incorrect because it only considers the areas of rectangles that are formed by two adjacent segments. It does not consider the areas of rectangles that are formed by non-adjacent segments.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The code below contains several off-by-one errors. For example, the loop that iterates over the array `a` starts at index `0`, but the loop that iterates over the array `b` starts at index `1`. This means that the code will not consider the first element of the array `a` when it calculates the maximum area of the rectangle.
5. **Use of undefined variables**. The code below uses the variable `b` without first defining it. This will cause the program to crash when it tries to access the variable `b`.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that your code is correct. You should also use a debugger to help you find any errors in your code.
Test inputs:

Title:
CODEFORCES 1492_D. Genius's Gambit

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains three integers, but the developer may accidentally use a data type that is too small to store all of the values. This can lead to incorrect results or even a crash.

**2. Using incorrect operators**

The problem requires the developer to find two integers that satisfy certain conditions. The developer may accidentally use the wrong operators, such as using `+` instead of `|`, which can lead to incorrect results.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

The problem specifies that `a` and `b` must be non-negative, and that `k` must be less than or equal to `a + b`. The developer must make sure to handle these edge cases correctly, or the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

**4. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a simple greedy algorithm. The developer may accidentally use a more complex algorithm that is not necessary, or that takes longer to run.

**5. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly. The developer should test the code with a variety of inputs, including both valid and invalid inputs.

**6. Not using a debugger**

A debugger can be a helpful tool for debugging problems. The developer should use a debugger to step through the code and identify the source of the error.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1515_E. Phoenix and Computers

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect modulo operation

When calculating the final answer, it is important to make sure that the modulo operation is performed correctly. For example, if the modulo is 100000007 and the answer is 100000008, the correct answer should be 8.

### 2. Off-by-one errors

When iterating over a range of numbers, it is important to make sure that the upper bound is exclusive. For example, if you are iterating over the numbers from 1 to 10, the loop should run from 1 to 9.

### 3. Indexing errors

When indexing into an array or list, it is important to make sure that the index is within the bounds of the array. For example, if an array has 10 elements, the index should never be greater than 9.

### 4. Undefined behavior

When using undefined behavior, it is possible for the program to behave in an unpredictable way. For example, if you divide by zero, the program could crash or it could produce an incorrect result.

### 5. Memory leaks

When a program allocates memory, it is important to free that memory when it is no longer needed. If memory is not freed, it can eventually lead to a memory leak, which can slow down the program or even cause it to crash.

### 6. Race conditions

A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same shared data at the same time. This can lead to unpredictable behavior or even a crash.

### 7. Deadlocks

A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, but neither thread can do so. This can also lead to a crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1542_D. Priority Queue

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the multiset**

The multiset in the problem statement is defined as a set of integers. However, if you use an integer array to represent the multiset, you may encounter a problem when you try to erase the smallest element from the multiset. This is because the smallest element in an integer array is not necessarily the first element in the array. For example, if the multiset contains the elements {1, 2, 3}, the smallest element is 1, but the first element in the array is 2.

To avoid this problem, you should use a data type that supports efficient lookup of the smallest element, such as a binary heap.

**2. Not handling the case where the multiset is empty**

The problem statement states that the multiset may be empty. However, if you simply iterate through the elements of the multiset and add or remove elements from the multiset, you will get an incorrect answer if the multiset is empty.

To handle the case where the multiset is empty, you need to initialize the multiset to an empty set before you start iterating through the elements of the multiset.

**3. Using the wrong modulo operation**

The problem statement states that the answer should be modulo 998244353. However, if you use the % operator to perform the modulo operation, you may get an incorrect answer. This is because the % operator does not always return the remainder of the division. For example, if you divide 1000 by 998244353, the % operator will return 1000, not 0.

To avoid this problem, you should use the **mod** function to perform the modulo operation. The **mod** function always returns the remainder of the division.

**4. Not using the same modulo operation for all calculations**

The problem statement states that the answer should be modulo 998244353. However, if you use different modulo operations for different calculations, you may get an incorrect answer. For example, if you calculate the sum of the elements in the multiset using the % operator, and then calculate the product of the elements in the multiset using the **mod** function, you will get an incorrect answer.

To avoid this problem, you should use the same modulo operation for all calculations.

**5. Using a floating-point data type for the multiset**

The problem statement states that the answer should be an integer. However, if you use a floating-point data type for the multiset, you may get an incorrect answer. This is because floating-point numbers are not always exact. For example, the floating-point number 0.1 is not exactly equal to 1 / 10.

To avoid this problem, you should use an integer data type for the multiset.

CODEFORCES 16_D. Logging

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, you might accidentally read a number as a letter, or you might forget to put a space between two words. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect time calculation.** The problem asks you to find the minimum number of days covered by the log. To do this, you need to be able to correctly calculate the time difference between two events. This can be tricky, especially if the events are not in the same time zone.
3. **Incorrect date calculation.** The problem also asks you to consider midnight as the start of a new day. This means that you need to be able to correctly calculate the date of an event based on its time. This can be tricky, especially if the event happens at the end of one day and the beginning of the next.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The problem asks you to output a single number, which is the minimum number of days covered by the log. Make sure that you format your output correctly, or the judges will not be able to grade your solution.
5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that you could encounter when solving this problem. For example, you might accidentally use the wrong variable, or you might forget to check for a boundary condition. It's important to be careful and to test your code thoroughly to avoid these kinds of bugs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 262_E. Maxim and Matrix

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is given as two integers n and t. If you try to read them using the `%d` specifier, you will get an incorrect answer. This is because the `%d` specifier only reads the first 32 bits of the input, which is not enough for numbers larger than 2^31-1.

To read the input correctly, you need to use the `%I64d` specifier. This specifier will read the entire 64-bit integer from the input.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks you to count the number of numbers m (1 ≤ m ≤ n) such that the sum of values in the cells in the row number m + 1 of the resulting matrix equals t.

A naive algorithm would be to iterate over all possible values of m and check if the sum of values in the row number m + 1 of the resulting matrix equals t. However, this algorithm would be very inefficient.

A more efficient algorithm would be to use the following formula:

```
count = (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 2 - t
```

This formula gives the exact number of numbers m (1 ≤ m ≤ n) such that the sum of values in the cells in the row number m + 1 of the resulting matrix equals t.

**3. Overflow errors**

When calculating the sum of values in the row number m + 1 of the resulting matrix, you need to be careful not to overflow. This is because the sum of values in a row can be very large.

To avoid overflow errors, you need to use the `unsigned long long` type to store the sum of values.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

When counting the number of numbers m (1 ≤ m ≤ n) such that the sum of values in the cells in the row number m + 1 of the resulting matrix equals t, you need to be careful not to make an off-by-one error.

This is because the sum of values in the row number n + 1 of the resulting matrix is t + 1. So, you need to subtract 1 from the formula given in the previous section to get the correct answer.

**5. Incorrect output format**

The output should be a single integer. Make sure to print the output in the correct format.

CODEFORCES 286_E. Ladies' Shop

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible that the user will enter incorrect data. For example, they may enter a number that is not an integer, or they may enter a number that is too large or too small. If this happens, the program will not be able to process the input correctly and will likely crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is possible that the user will enter incorrect data. For example, they may enter a number that is not an integer, or they may enter a number that is too large or too small. If this happens, the program will not be able to process the output correctly and will likely crash.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, it may not be able to find the optimal solution, or it may take too long to run. If this happens, the program will not be able to solve the problem correctly and will likely return an incorrect answer.

**4. Incorrect data**

The data used to test the program may be incorrect. For example, it may contain duplicate values, or it may contain values that are not within the correct range. If this happens, the program will not be able to test the algorithm correctly and will likely produce incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect assumptions**

The program may make incorrect assumptions about the input data. For example, it may assume that the data is always valid, or it may assume that the data is always in the correct format. If this happens, the program will not be able to handle unexpected input and will likely crash.

CODEFORCES 311_E. Biologist

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable types.** The input is a list of integers, but the code is expecting a list of strings. This can be fixed by changing the type of the input variable to `list(map(int, input().split()))`.
2. **Incorrect index.** The code is trying to access the element at index `-1` of the list, which does not exist. This can be fixed by changing the index to `n - 1`.
3. **Off-by-one error.** The code is adding one to the number of dogs in the list, which results in an incorrect answer. This can be fixed by removing the `+ 1` from the code.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The code is not taking into account the fact that the dogs can be changed at most once. This can be fixed by adding a check to make sure that the dog has not already been changed.
5. **Incorrect output.** The code is printing the wrong answer. This can be fixed by changing the output statement to `print(max_money)`.

Here is the correct code:

```python
n, m, g = map(int, input().split())
dogs = list(map(int, input().split()))
costs = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(m):
    gender, wi, ki, *indexes = map(int, input().split())
    is_friend = indexes[-1] == 1
    if is_friend:
        g = min(g, wi)

max_money = 0
for i in range(n):
    if dogs[i] == 0:
        if costs[i] <= g:
            max_money += costs[i]
    elif dogs[i] == 1:

Title:
CODEFORCES 334_C. Secrets

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type:** The input value `n` can be as large as `1017`, which is larger than the maximum value of `int`. So we need to use a larger data type, such as `long long`.
2. **Off-by-one error:** When calculating the minimum number of coins, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, if `n = 4` and the buyer has three coins of 3 marks, we need to give `2` coins, not `3` coins.
3. **Incorrect calculation:** When calculating the maximum number of coins, it is easy to make a mistake. For example, if we have two coins of 3 marks and one coin of 9 marks, we can give `4` coins to Gerald, not `3` coins.
4. **Memory leak:** If we do not release the memory used by the data structures, we may have a memory leak.
5. **Synchronization issue:** If we are using multiple threads, we need to make sure that the threads are synchronized correctly.
6. **Security issue:** We need to make sure that the code is secure and does not have any vulnerabilities.

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correctly specified, which can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output. For example, if the input format is not specified as `n,m`, the program may not be able to correctly parse the input and may crash.
* **Incorrect data type:** The data type of the input values may not be correctly specified, which can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output. For example, if the input values are specified as strings, the program may not be able to correctly parse the input and may crash.
* **Incorrect algorithm:** The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect, which can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output. For example, if the algorithm does not take into account all of the constraints of the problem, the program may not be able to find a solution.
* **Incorrect implementation:** The implementation of the algorithm may be incorrect, which can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output. For example, if the implementation does not correctly handle all of the edge cases, the program may not be able to find a solution.

By carefully checking the input format, data types, algorithm, and implementation, you can avoid these problems and bugs and ensure that your program correctly solves the problem.

### Possible Problems and Bugs

1. **Incorrect implementation of the tree construction algorithm.** This could lead to incorrect results for the subtree queries.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the union operation.** This could lead to incorrect results for the subtree queries.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the set data structure.** This could lead to incorrect results for the subtree queries.
4. **Incorrect handling of boundary cases.** This could lead to incorrect results for the subtree queries.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to carefully implement the tree construction algorithm, the union operation, the set data structure, and the boundary cases. Finally, it is important to test the program thoroughly to catch any errors.

Here are some specific examples of problems that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer might incorrectly implement the tree construction algorithm, resulting in incorrect results for the subtree queries. For example, the developer might forget to initialize the `cnt` array to 1, or they might incorrectly calculate the number of vertices on each level.
* The developer might incorrectly implement the union operation, resulting in incorrect results for the subtree queries. For example, the developer might not correctly handle the case where two sets are disjoint, or they might not correctly handle the case where two sets have a common element.
* The developer might incorrectly implement the set data structure, resulting in incorrect results for the subtree queries. For example, the developer might not correctly handle the case where a set is empty, or they might not correctly handle the case where a set contains duplicate elements.
* The developer might incorrectly handle boundary cases, resulting in incorrect results for the subtree queries. For example, the developer might not correctly handle the case where a vertex has no children, or they might not correctly handle the case where a vertex has two children.
* The developer might incorrectly handle errors, resulting in the program crashing or producing incorrect results. For example, the developer might not correctly handle the case where the input is invalid, or they might not correctly handle the case where the program runs out of memory.

By carefully reading the problem statement, implementing the algorithm correctly, and testing the program thoroughly, you can avoid these problems and write a correct solution to the problem.

CODEFORCES 617_C. Watering Flowers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always strictly followed, and it is easy to make a mistake when parsing the input. For example, if the input contains a space after the first integer, the code will likely fail.
2. **Incorrect calculation of distances.** The distance between two points is not always calculated correctly. For example, if the two points are on the same line, the distance between them is often calculated as the absolute value of their x- or y-coordinates, instead of the actual distance between them.
3. **Incorrect choice of r1 and r2.** The values of r1 and r2 are often chosen incorrectly, resulting in a solution that is not optimal. For example, if r1 is too small, some flowers will not be watered by the first fountain, and if r2 is too small, some flowers will not be watered by the second fountain.
4. **Incorrect output.** The output is often incorrect, either because it is not in the correct format or because it does not contain the correct value. For example, the output may contain a space after the integer, or it may not contain the correct number of digits.

CODEFORCES 68_B. Energy exchange

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain more or less values than expected, or the values may not be in the correct format. This can lead to errors in the program's output.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the maximum possible amount of energy**

The maximum possible amount of energy is the smallest value that all of the accumulators can have after the transfers. This value can be calculated by finding the smallest common multiple of all of the accumulators' values. However, if the accumulators' values are not all integers, this calculation can be incorrect.

**3. Incorrect rounding of the output**

The output should be rounded to a precision of 10-6. This means that the output should be accurate to the sixth decimal place. However, if the output is not rounded correctly, this can lead to errors in the program's output.

**4. Incorrect error handling**

The program should handle errors correctly. For example, if the input format is incorrect, the program should print an error message and exit. If the program encounters a runtime error, it should also print an error message and exit.

**5. Other bugs**

There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:

* Using the wrong data type for the accumulators' values
* Using the wrong formula to calculate the maximum possible amount of energy
* Using the wrong method to round the output
* Not handling errors correctly

By following these tips, you can help to avoid common problems and bugs when solving this problem.
Test inputs:
**Incorrect input format**

Title:
CODEFORCES 711_E. ZS and The Birthday Paradox

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input format specifies that `n` and `k` should be integers in the range `[1, 1018]`. However, if you accidentally use a data type that can store larger values, such as `long`, your program may overflow and produce incorrect results.

**2. Using incorrect mathematical formulas**

The birthday paradox states that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday in a group of `n` people is approximately `1 - (365! / (365-n)! / 365^n)`. However, this formula is only an approximation, and it may not be accurate for small values of `n`.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

The birthday paradox does not apply to groups of fewer than two people. If `k` is less than 2, your program should return an error message.

**4. Not using modular arithmetic**

The output format specifies that `A` and `B` should be coprime and modulo 106 + 3. This means that you need to use modular arithmetic to ensure that the values of `A` and `B` are not divisible by any common factors.

**5. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The birthday paradox can be solved using a variety of algorithms. However, the most efficient algorithm is the **Sedgewick-Knuth algorithm**. This algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer approach to quickly calculate the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday in a group of `n` people.

**6. Not testing your code**

It is always important to test your code before submitting it to a competition. This will help you to identify and fix any bugs before it is too late.

Title:
CODEFORCES 732_E. Sockets

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type.** The input data is given as strings, but the problem requires integers. This can be fixed by using the `int()` function to convert the strings to integers.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator.** The problem requires the output to be two integers, but the code is comparing them using the `==` operator. This should be changed to the `!=` operator.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The code is not correctly calculating the minimum number of adapters needed. The correct logic is to iterate through the computers and sockets, and add one to the adapter count whenever the power of a computer is greater than the power of a socket.
4. **Off-by-one error.** The code is printing the number of adapters one less than the actual number. This can be fixed by adding one to the adapter count before printing it.
5. **Incorrect output format.** The code is not printing the output in the correct format. The correct format is to print the two integers on the same line, followed by a newline character.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
p = list(map(int, input().split()))
s = list(map(int, input().split()))

c = 0
u = 0
for i in range(n):

CODEFORCES 756_F. Long number

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect regular expression.** The regular expression used to parse the input may not be correct, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, the regular expression `^[0-9]+$` would match the input `1234-5678`, but it would not match the input `1234-56789`.
2. **Incorrect handling of negative numbers.** The grammar for numbers allows for negative numbers, but the regular expression used to parse the input may not correctly handle negative numbers. For example, the regular expression `^[0-9]+$` would match the input `-1234`, but it would not match the input `1234-5678`.
3. **Incorrect handling of parentheses.** The grammar for expressions allows for parentheses, but the regular expression used to parse the input may not correctly handle parentheses. For example, the regular expression `^[0-9]+$` would match the input `(1234-5678)`, but it would not match the input `1234-(5678)`.
4. **Incorrect handling of concatenation.** The grammar for expressions allows for concatenation, but the regular expression used to parse the input may not correctly handle concatenation. For example, the regular expression `^[0-9]+$` would match the input `12345678`, but it would not match the input `1234(5678)`.
5. **Incorrect handling of modulo.** The grammar for expressions allows for modulo, but the regular expression used to parse the input may not correctly handle modulo. For example, the regular expression `^[0-9]+$` would match the input `123456789%109+7`, but it would not match the input `123456789 mod 109+7`.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design the regular expression used to parse the input. The regular expression should be able to correctly match all valid inputs and should not match any invalid inputs. Additionally, the regular expression should be able to handle negative numbers, parentheses, concatenation, and modulo correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 778_B. Bitwise Formula

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect variable initialization

When initializing variables, it is important to make sure that they are of the correct type and have the correct value. In this problem, the variables are m-bit binary numbers. So, when initializing a variable, you should make sure that it is a string of length m and that each character in the string is either a 0 or a 1.

For example, the following code would initialize a variable called `a` to the value `0101`:

```
a = "0101"
```

However, the following code would not initialize a variable called `b` to the value `1000`, because the string `"1000"` is not of length m:

```
b = "1000"
```

### 2. Incorrect bitwise operations

When performing bitwise operations, it is important to make sure that the operands are of the same type and that the result is of the correct type. In this problem, the operands are m-bit binary numbers, and the result is also an m-bit binary number.

For example, the following code would correctly perform the bitwise AND operation on two variables called `a` and `b`:

```
c = a & b
```

However, the following code would not correctly perform the bitwise OR operation on two variables called `a` and `b`, because the result would be a string of length m+1:

```
c = a | b
```

### 3. Incorrect variable usage

When using variables, it is important to make sure that they are initialized and that they have the correct value. In this problem, the variables are used to store the values of the bitwise operations. So, when using a variable, you should make sure that it has been initialized and that it contains the correct value.

For example, the following code would correctly use a variable called `c` to store the value of the bitwise OR operation on two variables called `a` and `b`:

```
c = a | b
```

However, the following code would not correctly use a variable called `d` to store the value of the bitwise OR operation on two variables called `a` and `b`, because the variable `d` has not been initialized:

```
d = a | b
```

### 4. Incorrect output format

The output of this problem should be two m-bit binary numbers, one for the minimum possible score and one for the maximum possible score. The two numbers should be separated by a newline character.

For example, the following code would correctly output the minimum and maximum possible scores for the problem:

```
print("0101")
print("1000")
```

However, the following code would not correctly output the minimum and maximum possible scores, because the second number is not a m-bit binary number:

```
print("0101")
print("10000")
```
Test inputs:
```
3 3
a := 101
b := 011
c := ? XOR b
```

bb := 0
cx := ? OR a
d := ? XOR ?

Title:
CODEFORCES 802_E. Marmots (medium)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type.** The input data is given as a string, but the problem requires the output to be an integer. A developer may accidentally cast the input data to the wrong data type, which will result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect calculation.** The problem requires the developer to estimate the population of each village. To do this, the developer must first calculate the mean and variance of the distribution from which the marmots drew their answers. Then, the developer must use these values to calculate the probability that the marmots would have given the answers that they did. Finally, the developer must multiply this probability by the population of the village to estimate the number of marmots that were in the village. A developer may make a mistake in any of these steps, which will result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Off-by-one error.** When calculating the mean and variance of the distribution, the developer may accidentally add or subtract one from the number of marmots in the village. This will result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect rounding.** When calculating the estimated population of the village, the developer may round the answer to the wrong number of decimal places. This will result in an answer that is not within the required interval.
5. **Incorrect formatting.** The output must be one line per village, in the same order as provided in the input. The developer must make sure to format the output correctly, or the judges will not be able to grade it correctly.

By following these tips, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving the Marmots problem.

* The input data may not be consistent. For example, a router may be listed in two different lists.
* The output data may be invalid. For example, the number of patch cords may not be equal to the number of routers minus 1, or two routers may be listed in the same patch cord.
* The output data may not be consistent with the input data. For example, a patch cord may not contain two routers that are listed in the same list.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input data and ensure that it is valid and consistent. The developer should also carefully check the output data and ensure that it is valid and consistent with the input data.

Title:
CODEFORCES 86_B. Tetris revisited

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible that the user will enter incorrect data. For example, they may enter a number that is too large or a character that is not a digit or a period. This could cause the program to crash or output incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is possible that the user will output incorrect data. For example, they may output a number that is not a digit or a period, or they may not output the data in the correct order. This could cause the program to crash or output incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program may be incorrect, which could cause it to output incorrect results or crash. For example, the program may not correctly check if the game is over or if there is a way to win.
4. **Memory leaks.** The program may not properly free up memory after it is finished using it, which could cause the system to run out of memory and crash.
5. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program may contain security vulnerabilities that could allow a malicious user to gain access to the system. For example, the program may not properly validate user input, which could allow a user to inject malicious code into the program.

CODEFORCES 896_A. Nephren gives a riddle

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem states that `fi = "What are you doing while sending "fi - 1"? Are you busy? Will you send "fi - 1"?"`, but some developers may mistakenly think that `fi = "What are you doing while sending "fi""? Are you busy? Will you send "fi"?"`. This would lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the fi function.** The fi function should take an integer `n` as input and return the string `f(n)`. Some developers may mistakenly return the string `f(n - 1)`. This would also lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect handling of the edge case where `n < 0`.** The problem states that `0 ≤ n ≤ 105`, but some developers may not handle the case where `n < 0` correctly. This could lead to a segmentation fault or other errors.
4. **Incorrect handling of the edge case where `k > len(f(n))`.** The problem states that `1 ≤ k ≤ 1018`, but some developers may not handle the case where `k > len(f(n))` correctly. This could lead to an incorrect answer or a segmentation fault.
5. **Incorrect use of the `ord()` function.** The `ord()` function returns the ASCII code of a character. Some developers may mistakenly use the `ord()` function to get the index of a character in a string. This would lead to incorrect results.
6. **Incorrect use of the `chr()` function.** The `chr()` function returns the character with the given ASCII code. Some developers may mistakenly use the `chr()` function to get the index of a character in a string. This would lead to incorrect results.
7. **Incorrect use of the `substring()` function.** The `substring()` function returns the substring of a string starting at the given index and ending at the given length. Some developers may mistakenly use the `substring()` function to get the index of a character in a string. This would lead to incorrect results.
8. **Incorrect use of the `find()` function.** The `find()` function returns the index of the first occurrence of the given substring in a string. Some developers may mistakenly use the `find()` function to get the index of a character in a string. This would lead to incorrect results.
9. **Incorrect use of the `replace()` function.** The `replace()` function replaces all occurrences of the given substring in a string with the given replacement string. Some developers may mistakenly use the `replace()` function to get the index of a character in a string. This would lead to incorrect results.
10. **Incorrect use of the `split()` function.** The `split()` function splits a string into a list of substrings based on the given separator. Some developers may mistakenly use the `split()` function to get the index of a character in a string. This would lead to incorrect results.
Test inputs:
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 917_B. MADMAX

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect graph representation**. The graph is represented as an adjacency list, where each vertex is represented by an integer and each edge is represented by a tuple of two integers. However, the input graph is represented as a list of edges, where each edge is represented by a tuple of three integers. This can lead to errors in the graph traversal and incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect edge traversal**. The graph is traversed in a depth-first order. However, the input graph may not be acyclic, which can lead to an infinite loop. To avoid this, the graph should be checked for cycles before it is traversed.
3. **Incorrect character comparison**. The characters on the edges are compared using the ASCII code. However, the ASCII code is not a reliable way to compare characters, as some characters have the same ASCII code. To avoid this, the characters should be compared using a more robust method, such as the Unicode code point.
4. **Incorrect winner determination**. The winner of the game is determined by the last character on the edge. However, the last character on the edge may not be the highest character. To avoid this, the characters on the edges should be sorted in descending order before the winner is determined.
5. **Incorrect output formatting**. The output should be a list of strings, where each string is the length of the graph and contains the characters 'A' and 'B'. However, the output may be a single string or a list of integers. To avoid this, the output should be properly formatted before it is printed.

By following these tips, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving the MADMAX problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 965_E. Short Code

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the prefix function.** The prefix function of a string $s$ is a function $f(i)$ that returns the longest substring of $s$ that is a prefix of $s$ and also a suffix of $s$. For example, the prefix function of the string "abcabc" is $f(0) = "a", f(1) = "ab", f(2) = "abc", f(3) = "abca", and $f(4) = "abcabc"$.

A common mistake is to use the prefix function to find the shortest substring of $s$ that is a prefix of $s$ and also a suffix of $s$. This is incorrect because the prefix function does not always return the shortest such substring. For example, the prefix function of the string "abcabc" returns the substring "abca", which is not the shortest substring that is a prefix of $s$ and also a suffix of $s$.

The correct way to find the shortest substring of $s$ that is a prefix of $s$ and also a suffix of $s$ is to use the following algorithm:

1. Initialize $i = 0$ and $j = |s| - 1$.
2. While $i < j$:
    1. If $s[i] = s[j]$, increment $i$ and decrement $j$.
    2. Otherwise, break the loop.
3. The substring from $s[i]$ to $s[j]$ is the shortest substring of $s$ that is a prefix of $s$ and also a suffix of $s$.

2. **Incorrect use of the suffix function.** The suffix function of a string $s$ is a function $g(i)$ that returns the longest substring of $s$ that is a suffix of $s$ and also a prefix of $s$. For example, the suffix function of the string "abcabc" is $g(0) = "abc", g(1) = "cba", g(2) = "abc", g(3) = "cba", and $g(4) = "abcabc"$.

A common mistake is to use the suffix function to find the shortest substring of $s$ that is a suffix of $s$ and also a prefix of $s$. This is incorrect because the suffix function does not always return the shortest such substring. For example, the suffix function of the string "abcabc" returns the substring "abca", which is not the shortest substring that is a suffix of $s$ and also a prefix of $s$.

The correct way to find the shortest substring of $s$ that is a suffix of $s$ and also a prefix of $s$ is to use the following algorithm:

1. Initialize $i = 0$ and $j = |s| - 1$.
2. While $i < j$:
    1. If $s[i] = s[j]$, decrement $i$ and increment $j$.
    2. Otherwise, break the loop.
3. The substring from $s[i]$ to $s[j]$ is the shortest substring of $s$ that is a suffix of $s$ and also a prefix of $s$.

3. **Incorrect use of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm.** The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm is a string-matching algorithm that can be used to find all occurrences of a pattern in a string. The algorithm works by first building a table of prefixes of the pattern. This table can then be used to quickly find all occurrences of the pattern in the string.

A common mistake is to use the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm to find the longest common substring of two strings. This is incorrect because the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm only finds occurrences of the pattern in the string, not the longest common substring of the two strings.

The correct way to find the longest common substring of two strings is to use the following algorithm:

1. Initialize $i = 0$ and $j = 0$.
2. While $i < |s_1|$ and $j < |s_2|$:
    1. If $s_1[i] = s_2[j]$, increment $i$ and $j$.
    2. Otherwise, break the loop.
3. The substring from $s_1[i - 1]$ to $s_1[i]$ is the longest common

HACKEREARTH drunk-man

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not clearly defined. It is not clear how many test cases there are, or what the format of each test case is. This could lead to the developer incorrectly parsing the input and getting incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of time**. The time it takes for the drunk person to fall in the manhole depends on the distance between the manhole and the starting point, the drunk person's speed, and the time it takes to complete one meter. The developer needs to make sure that they are correctly calculating all of these values to get the correct answer.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not clearly defined. It is not clear whether the developer should print the manhole in which the drunk person falls, the time it takes for them to fall in, or both. This could lead to the developer incorrectly formatting the output and getting incorrect results.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer may make off-by-one errors when calculating the distance between the manhole and the starting point, the drunk person's speed, or the time it takes to complete one meter. This could lead to the developer getting incorrect results.
5. **Logical errors**. The developer may make logical errors when calculating the time it takes for the drunk person to fall in the manhole. For example, they may forget to account for the fact that the drunk person's speed will decrease as they get closer to the manhole. This could lead to the developer getting incorrect results.

Title:
HACKEREARTH little-monty-and-fibonacci-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Fibonacci sequence.** The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. For example, the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and the next number is 0 + 1 = 1. The next number is 1 + 1 = 2, and so on. A common mistake is to implement the Fibonacci sequence incorrectly, such as by adding the two most recent numbers instead of the two preceding numbers. This will result in an incorrect sequence of numbers.
2. **Off-by-one error.** Another common mistake is to make an off-by-one error when counting the number of multiples of a number. For example, if you are asked to count the number of multiples of 3 between 1 and 10, you might accidentally count 3, 6, and 9, but forget to count 12. This will result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect use of a loop.** When iterating through a series of numbers, it is important to make sure that the loop terminates correctly. For example, if you are asked to count the number of multiples of 3 between 1 and 10, you might accidentally write a loop that iterates from 1 to 11. This will result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect use of a conditional statement.** When using a conditional statement, it is important to make sure that the condition is correct. For example, if you are asked to count the number of multiples of 3 between 1 and 10, you might accidentally write a conditional statement that checks if the number is divisible by 4. This will result in an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect use of an array.** When using an array, it is important to make sure that the array is large enough to hold all of the elements. For example, if you are asked to count the number of multiples of 3 between 1 and 10, you might accidentally create an array that is only large enough to hold 10 elements. This will result in an incorrect answer.
6. **Incorrect use of a function.** When using a function, it is important to make sure that the function is called correctly. For example, if you are asked to count the number of multiples of 3 between 1 and 10, you might accidentally call the function with the wrong arguments. This will result in an incorrect answer.
7. **Incorrect use of a variable.** When using a variable, it is important to make sure that the variable is initialized correctly. For example, if you are asked to count the number of multiples of 3 between 1 and 10, you might accidentally initialize the variable to 0. This will result in an incorrect answer.
8. **Incorrect use of a constant.** When using a constant, it is important to make sure that the constant is used correctly. For example, if you are asked to count the number of multiples of 3 between 1 and 10, you might accidentally use the constant 4 instead of the constant 3. This will result in an incorrect answer.

HACKEREARTH myfibonacci-easy-contest

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one error.** The most common mistake is to forget to add 1 to the index when accessing the array. This can lead to the incorrect calculation of the Fibonacci number.
2. **Incorrect use of recursion.** Recursion can be a powerful tool for solving recursive problems, but it is important to use it correctly. One common mistake is to forget to base case. This can lead to the program running forever or returning an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect use of loops.** Loops can be used to iterate over a collection of elements, but it is important to use them correctly. One common mistake is to forget to increment the loop counter. This can lead to the program skipping elements or repeating elements.
4. **Incorrect data type.** The data type of the input and output values must be correct. For example, if the input values are integers, the output value must also be an integer.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** It is important to handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input values are invalid, the program should print an error message and exit.
6. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program must be correct. For example, the program must correctly calculate the Fibonacci number.
7. **Incorrect implementation.** The program must be implemented correctly. For example, the program must use the correct data structures and algorithms.

Title:
HACKEREARTH prime-sum-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of `range()` function.** The `range()` function in Python returns a sequence of numbers from a starting number to an ending number, excluding the ending number. For example, `range(5)` returns the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. If you want to include the ending number, you can use the `end` parameter. For example, `range(5, 10)` returns the numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
2. **Using the wrong data type.** When working with numbers, it is important to use the correct data type. For example, if you are working with integers, you should use the `int` data type. If you are working with floating-point numbers, you should use the `float` data type.
3. **Using incorrect operators.** When performing mathematical operations, it is important to use the correct operators. For example, to add two numbers, you should use the `+` operator. To subtract two numbers, you should use the `-` operator.
4. **Not handling errors correctly.** When writing code, it is important to handle errors correctly. For example, if you try to divide a number by zero, you should raise an exception.
5. **Not using the most efficient algorithm.** There are many different ways to solve a problem. When writing code, it is important to use the most efficient algorithm. For example, to find the prime numbers less than a given number, you can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.

Here are some specific bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer may incorrectly use the `range()` function and accidentally include the ending number in the sequence. This would result in the developer calculating the wrong answer.
* The developer may use the wrong data type for the numbers. For example, they may use the `str` data type for the numbers, which would cause errors when performing mathematical operations.
* The developer may use incorrect operators when performing mathematical operations. For example, they may use the `*` operator to add two numbers, which would result in the wrong answer.
* The developer may not handle errors correctly. For example, they may not raise an exception when they try to divide a number by zero.
* The developer may not use the most efficient algorithm to solve the problem. This could result in the developer's code running slowly.

Title:
HACKEREARTH sandy-permutes

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of swaps made.** This is a common mistake that can be made when solving this problem, as it is easy to forget that each swap counts as two operations. To avoid this mistake, it is important to keep track of the number of swaps made in a separate variable.
2. **Not considering all possible swaps.** When trying to find the largest permutation, it is important to consider all possible swaps that can be made. This can be done by iterating over all pairs of elements in the array and swapping them if doing so would result in a larger permutation.
3. **Not using the most efficient algorithm.** There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem, but not all of them are equally efficient. The most efficient algorithm for this problem is the bubble sort algorithm.
4. **Not handling edge cases correctly.** There are a number of edge cases that can occur when solving this problem, such as when the input array is empty or when the number of swaps is greater than the number of elements in the array. It is important to handle these edge cases correctly in order to avoid errors.
5. **Not using a test suite.** It is important to use a test suite to verify that your code is correct. This can help to catch bugs that you may have missed during development.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems when solving this problem:

* Use a test suite to verify that your code is correct.
* Keep track of the number of swaps made in a separate variable.
* Consider all possible swaps.
* Use the most efficient algorithm.
* Handle edge cases correctly.

HACKEREARTH supertables-3

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for N**

N is an integer that can be very large. If you use a data type that is too small, you may get an overflow error. For example, if you use a `int` data type, you may get an overflow error when N is greater than 2147483647.

**2. Using the wrong formula to calculate the Nth number**

The Nth number in the supertable is not simply the sum of the Nth numbers in the tables of A and B. You need to take into account the fact that the tables are merged in sorted order and that duplicates are removed.

**3. Not handling the case where N is greater than the number of elements in the supertable**

If N is greater than the number of elements in the supertable, you should return `-1`.

**4. Not handling the case where A and B are equal**

If A and B are equal, the supertable is simply the table of A. In this case, you should return the Nth number in the table of A.

**5. Not handling the case where A and B are negative**

The tables of A and B are merged in sorted order. This means that the Nth number in the supertable will be the Nth smallest number in the merged table. If A and B are negative, the merged table will contain negative numbers. In this case, you should return the Nth smallest **positive** number in the merged table.

ATCODER p02626 AtCoder Beginner Contest 172 - Unfair Nim

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input type**. The input format specifies that `N` should be an integer, but the following code will accept a string as input:

```
N = input()
```

2. **Incorrect output type**. The output format specifies that the output should be an integer, but the following code will output a string:

```
print("1")
```

3. **Off-by-one error**. The following code will incorrectly count the number of piles of stones:

```
N = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

total_stones = 0
for a in A:
    total_stones += a

print(total_stones - 1)
```

The correct code should be:

```
N = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

total_stones = sum(A)

print(total_stones - 1)
```

4. **Incorrect logic**. The following code will incorrectly determine whether Takahashi can guarantee a win:

```
N = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

if N == 2:
    if A[0] == A[1]:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(1)
else:

Title:
ATCODER p02757 AtCoder Beginner Contest 158 - Divisible Substring

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input contains a string and an integer. The developer may incorrectly use an integer to store the string, which will cause a runtime error.

**2. Incorrect modulo operation**

The problem requires the developer to find the number of substrings that are divisible by P. The developer may incorrectly use the modulo operator (%) to check if a substring is divisible by P, which will lead to incorrect results.

**3. Off-by-one error**

The developer may incorrectly count the number of substrings. For example, the developer may count the empty substring as a substring, which will lead to an incorrect answer.

**4. Incorrect use of loop variables**

The developer may incorrectly use loop variables, which will lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may use the same loop variable to iterate over the string and the prime number, which will lead to an infinite loop.

**5. Incorrect use of mathematical functions**

The developer may incorrectly use mathematical functions, which will lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may use the factorial function to calculate the number of substrings, which will lead to an incorrect answer.

Title:
ATCODER p02892 AtCoder Grand Contest 039 - Graph Partition

Pain points:
**1. Input format**

The first line of the input contains an integer N, the number of vertices. The next N lines contain N characters each. The i-th line of the input describes the edges connected to the i-th vertex. A character `1` in the i-th line at the j-th position indicates that there is an edge between vertices i and j.

**2. Output format**

If it is impossible to divide the vertices into sets so that the condition is satisfied, print `-1`. Otherwise, print the maximum possible number of sets, k, in a division that satisfies the condition.

**3. Constraints**

* 2 ≤ N ≤ 200
* Each character in the input is either `0` or `1`.
* The first line of the input contains an integer N.
* The next N lines contain N characters each.
* The given graph is connected.

**5. Possible problems and bugs**

* **Incorrect input format**

The input format is not correct. For example, the first line of the input does not contain an integer N.

* **Incorrect output format**

The output format is not correct. For example, the output is not an integer.

* **Incorrect solution**

The solution does not find the maximum possible number of sets, k, in a division that satisfies the condition. For example, the solution returns -1 even though it is possible to divide the vertices into sets so that the condition is satisfied.

* **Incorrect runtime**

The solution runs in too much time. For example, the solution takes more than a second to run on a small input.

* **Incorrect memory usage**

The solution uses too much memory. For example, the solution uses more than 1 GB of memory on a small input.

Title:
ATCODER p03027 M-SOLUTIONS Programming Contest - Product of Arithmetic Progression

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulo operation**. In Python, `a % b` returns the remainder of `a / b`. For example, `10 % 3` returns `1`. However, in this problem, we need to find the remainder of `a * b`. To do this, we can use the following formula:

```
(a * b) % c = ((a % c) * (b % c)) % c
```

2. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers**. In Python, floating-point numbers are not always precise. For example, `0.1 + 0.2` does not equal `0.3` exactly. This can lead to errors in calculations. To avoid this problem, we can use integers instead of floating-point numbers.

3. **Incorrect use of the factorial function**. The factorial function `math.factorial(n)` returns the product of all the integers from 1 to n. However, this function can only handle integers up to a certain size. For larger values of n, we can use the following formula:

```
n! = (n / 2)! * (n + 1)!
```

4. **Incorrect use of the gcd function**. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers a and b is the largest integer that divides both a and b. The Python function `math.gcd(a, b)` returns the GCD of a and b. However, this function can only handle integers up to a certain size. For larger values of a and b, we can use the following formula:

```
gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b)
```

5. **Incorrect use of the extended Euclidean algorithm**. The extended Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the GCD of two integers a and b, and for finding integers x and y such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. The Python function `math.gcd(a, b, x, y)` returns the GCD of a and b, and the values of x and y. However, this function can only handle integers up to a certain size. For larger values of a and b, we can use the following formula:

```
gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b)
x = y - (a // b) * x
y = x

Title:
ATCODER p03168 Educational DP Contest - Coins

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is `3 0.30 0.60 0.80`, the program may not be able to parse the input correctly and output an incorrect result.
2. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers**. Floating-point numbers are often used to represent real numbers, but they are not always accurate. For example, the number `0.1` is not exactly equal to `1 / 10`, and the difference between the two numbers may be significant in some cases. This can lead to incorrect results if the program does not handle floating-point numbers correctly.
3. **Incorrect use of mathematical functions**. Mathematical functions such as `pow()` and `log()` can be used to perform calculations on floating-point numbers. However, these functions are not always accurate, and the results may be incorrect in some cases. This can lead to incorrect results if the program does not use these functions correctly.
4. **Incorrect use of boundary conditions**. Boundary conditions are conditions that occur at the edges of a problem domain. For example, if the problem is to find the area of a circle, the boundary condition is that the radius of the circle must be non-negative. If the program does not handle boundary conditions correctly, it may output incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect use of loops**. Loops are used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times. However, if the loop is not terminated correctly, it may run forever or output incorrect results. This can happen if the loop condition is not correct or if the loop body is not correct.
6. **Incorrect use of variables**. Variables are used to store data in a program. However, if variables are not declared correctly or if they are not initialized correctly, the program may not work correctly. This can happen if the variable type is not correct or if the variable value is not correct.
7. **Incorrect use of functions**. Functions are used to group together a set of statements that perform a specific task. However, if functions are not declared correctly or if they are not called correctly, the program may not work correctly. This can happen if the function name is not correct or if the function arguments are not correct.

Title:
ATCODER p03313 AtCoder Regular Contest 100 - Or Plus Max

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the bitwise OR operator.** The bitwise OR operator (`|`) is used to combine two bits into one. For example, `10 | 11` is equal to `11`, because `10` is binary for `1010` and `11` is binary for `1011`. However, some developers may accidentally use the logical OR operator (`||`), which returns `True` if either of its operands is `True`. This will result in incorrect answers.
2. **Incorrect use of the `max()` function.** The `max()` function returns the largest element in a list. For example, `max([1, 2, 3])` is equal to `3`. However, some developers may accidentally use the `min()` function, which returns the smallest element in a list. This will also result in incorrect answers.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The input to this problem may contain edge cases, such as `N = 0` or `A_i = 0`. Developers should be careful to handle these cases correctly.
4. **Memory errors.** The input to this problem may be very large, so it is important to be careful about memory usage. Developers should use a data structure that is appropriate for the size of the input.
5. **Time errors.** The running time of this problem may be very long, so it is important to be careful about the efficiency of your code. Developers should use a sorting algorithm that is appropriate for the size of the input.

Title:
ATCODER p03470 AtCoder Beginner Contest 085 - Kagami Mochi

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is given in centimeters, but the problem statement asks for the number of layers. A developer might accidentally use the input data as the number of layers, which would lead to an incorrect answer.

**2. Not considering the order of the mochi**

The problem statement specifies that the mochi must be stacked vertically, with each mochi having a smaller diameter than the one below it. A developer might accidentally stack the mochi in the wrong order, which would lead to an incorrect answer.

**3. Not handling duplicate mochi**

The problem statement does not specify what to do if there are duplicate mochi in the input data. A developer might accidentally count each mochi multiple times, which would lead to an incorrect answer.

**4. Not handling the edge cases**

The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input data is empty or if all of the mochi have the same diameter. A developer might accidentally crash the program or return an incorrect answer in these cases.

**5. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved in O(N) time using a greedy algorithm. A developer might accidentally use a slower algorithm, which would lead to a longer runtime.

ATCODER p03632 AtCoder Beginner Contest 070 - Two Switches

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input variables are integers, but the developer may mistakenly use a floating-point type. This would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator**. The problem states that Alice started holding down her button A second after the start-up of the robot, and released her button B second after the start-up. This means that the time interval during which Alice was holding down her button is B - A. However, the developer may mistakenly compare A to B, which would give the incorrect result of A - B.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The problem states that for how many seconds both Alice and Bob were holding down their buttons, the developer needs to subtract the smaller value from the larger value. However, the developer may mistakenly add the two values together, which would give the incorrect result.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The problem states that Alice started holding down her button A second after the start-up of the robot, and released her button B second after the start-up. This means that the time interval during which Alice was holding down her button is B - A + 1. However, the developer may mistakenly subtract A from B, which would give the incorrect result of B - A - 1.
5. **Incorrect output format**. The problem states that the output should be the length of the duration (in seconds) in which both Alice and Bob were holding down their buttons. However, the developer may mistakenly print the duration in minutes or hours.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not correct. For example, if the number of sections `N` is not an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The data type of some input values is incorrect. For example, if the number of sections `N` is a string, the program will crash.
3. **Off-by-one error.** The program may miss one or more elements when iterating over the input. For example, if the program is supposed to iterate over the list of sections, it may miss the last section.
4. **Index out of bounds.** The program may access an element outside of the bounds of the array. For example, if the program is supposed to access the element at index `N`, it may access the element at index `N+1`.
5. **Arithmetic error.** The program may perform an arithmetic operation incorrectly. For example, if the program is supposed to add two numbers, it may subtract them instead.
6. **Logic error.** The program may have a logical error. For example, the program may assume that all sections are double-tracked, when in fact some sections are single-tracked.
7. **Memory leak.** The program may not release memory that it has allocated. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
8. **Race condition.** The program may not be thread-safe. This can lead to a race condition, which can cause the program to produce incorrect results.
9. **Deadlock.** The program may deadlock. This can happen when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, and no thread ever releases the lock.
10. **Buffer overflow.** The program may overflow a buffer. This can happen when the program writes more data to a buffer than the buffer can hold.

Title:
ATCODER p03958 CODE FESTIVAL 2016 qual C - K Cakes

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input is given in the format of `K T`, but the code is expecting `K, T`. This will cause the code to fail to compile.
2. **Incorrect variable initialization**. The code initializes `dp` to `0`, but this is incorrect because `dp` is a 2D array. This will cause the code to produce incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code iterates over the array `a` twice, but this is unnecessary. This will cause the code to run slower than necessary.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The code subtracts `1` from `K` when calculating the number of days that the same type of cake is eaten, but this is incorrect. This will cause the code to produce incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect output format**. The code prints the number of days that the same type of cake is eaten, but this is not what the problem asks for. The problem asks for the minimum number of days that the same type of cake is eaten. This will cause the code to produce incorrect results.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully check your code for errors. Make sure that you are using the correct variable types, that you have initialized your variables correctly, that your logic is correct, and that your output format is correct.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is a single line of English text. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not work as expected.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single line of English text with the character strings apple and peach exchanged. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly swap the two words.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When swapping the two words, it is important to make sure that the words are swapped correctly. If one word is swapped with the word before or after it, the program will not work as expected.
4. **Case sensitivity**. The program should be case-sensitive, meaning that the two words should be swapped regardless of whether they are capitalized or not. If the program is not case-sensitive, the words will not be swapped correctly in some cases.
5. **Special characters**. The program should be able to handle special characters, such as accented letters and punctuation marks. If the program is not able to handle special characters, the words will not be swapped correctly in some cases.

AIZU p00967 Counting Cycles

Pain points:
```
## Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrectly counting the number of simple cycles.** A simple cycle is a connected subgraph all of whose vertices have degree exactly two. This means that each vertex in the cycle must be connected to exactly two other vertices in the cycle. If a vertex is connected to more than two other vertices in the cycle, then it is not a simple cycle. Similarly, if a vertex is connected to fewer than two other vertices in the cycle, then it is not a simple cycle.
2. **Not handling disconnected graphs correctly.** A disconnected graph is a graph that is not connected. This means that there is no path from one vertex to another in the graph. If a graph is disconnected, then it cannot contain any simple cycles.
3. **Not handling self-loops correctly.** A self-loop is an edge that connects a vertex to itself. Self-loops are not allowed in simple cycles. If a graph contains a self-loop, then it cannot contain any simple cycles.
4. **Not handling parallel edges correctly.** Parallel edges are two or more edges that connect the same two vertices. Parallel edges are not allowed in simple cycles. If a graph contains parallel edges, then it cannot contain any simple cycles.
5. **Not handling multiple solutions correctly.** There may be multiple simple cycles in a graph. If a graph contains multiple simple cycles, then the algorithm should return the total number of simple cycles in the graph.

## Here are some tips for avoiding these problems and bugs:

1. **Be careful when counting the number of vertices in a simple cycle.** Make sure to only count vertices that are actually part of the cycle. Do not count vertices that are only connected to the cycle by a single edge.
2. **Be careful when handling disconnected graphs.** If a graph is disconnected, then it cannot contain any simple cycles. Make sure to check for disconnected graphs before attempting to count the number of simple cycles in the graph.
3. **Be careful when handling self-loops.** Self-loops are not allowed in simple cycles. Make sure to check for self-loops before attempting to count the number of simple cycles in the graph.
4. **Be careful when handling parallel edges.** Parallel edges are not allowed in simple cycles. Make sure to check for parallel edges before attempting to count the number of simple cycles in the graph.
5. **Be careful when handling multiple solutions.** There may be multiple simple cycles in a graph. Make sure to return the total number of simple cycles in the graph, even if there are multiple solutions.

Title:
AIZU p01099 Warp Drive

Pain points:
**Possible Problems and Bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the output. For example, if the number of airports and flights are not separated by a newline, the program may not be able to parse the input correctly.
* **Incorrect data type:** The data types of the input values may not be correct, which may lead to errors in the output. For example, if the coordinates of an airport are not integers, the program may not be able to calculate the distance between the airports correctly.
* **Incorrect algorithm:** The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the algorithm does not take into account the fact that the warp fields can be built anywhere on the ground surface, the program may not find the optimal solution.
* **Incorrect implementation:** The program may be incorrectly implemented, which may lead to errors in the output. For example, if the program uses a variable that is not initialized, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

**How to avoid these problems:**

* **Follow the input format strictly:** Make sure that the input format is strictly followed. This can be done by using a tool such as a validator to check the input format.
* **Use the correct data types:** Make sure that the data types of the input values are correct. This can be done by using a tool such as a type checker to check the data types.
* **Use the correct algorithm:** Make sure that the algorithm used to solve the problem is correct. This can be done by testing the algorithm on a variety of inputs and checking the results.
* **Implement the program correctly:** Make sure that the program is implemented correctly. This can be done by testing the program on a variety of inputs and checking the results.

Title:
AIZU p01551 DNA

Pain points:
**Possible Problems**

* The input format is not very clear. It is not clear what the symbols `[AT]` and `[GC]` represent. It is also not clear what the difference is between a terminal symbol and a nonterminal symbol.
* The problem statement does not specify how to handle cases where the number of genes that match the syntax rules is not a multiple of 1,000,000,007.
* The problem statement does not specify how to handle cases where the input is malformed.

**Possible Bugs**

* The code may not correctly handle cases where the number of genes that match the syntax rules is not a multiple of 1,000,000,007.
* The code may not correctly handle cases where the input is malformed.
* The code may be inefficient.

**Solution**

To solve this problem, we can use a recursive backtracking algorithm. The algorithm starts by creating a new state that represents the empty string. We then iterate over the rules for the nonterminal symbol `1`. For each rule, we create a new state by appending the first symbol in the rule to the current state. We then recursively call the algorithm on the new state. If the algorithm returns a non-zero value, then we add that value to the total number of genes that match the syntax rules.

Once the algorithm has finished iterating over all of the rules for the nonterminal symbol `1`, we return the total number of genes that match the syntax rules.

To handle the case where the number of genes that match the syntax rules is not a multiple of 1,000,000,007, we can simply add the remainder to the total number of genes.

To handle the case where the input is malformed, we can simply return a zero value.

**Code**

```
def solve(na, nt, ng, nc, m, rules):
    total = 0

    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(len(rules[i][1])):
            new_state = rules[i][1][j]
            total += solve(na, nt, ng, nc, m, rules)

    return total


def main():
    na, nt, ng, nc = map(int, input().split())
    m = int(input())
    rules = []

    for i in range(m):
        rules.append(input().split())

    print(solve(na, nt, ng, nc, m, rules) % 1000000007)

Title:
AIZU p01707 Cookie Counter

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modular arithmetic.** When computing the number of ways to eat all the cookies, it is important to keep track of the remainder of the calculation modulo 1,000,000,007. If this is not done, the answer will be incorrect.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When counting the number of ways to eat all the cookies, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, if you are counting the number of ways to eat 5 cookies in 2 days, you might forget to include the possibility of eating 5 cookies on the first day and 0 cookies on the second day.
3. **Incorrect use of the binomial coefficient.** The binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$ gives the number of ways to choose k objects from a set of n objects. When computing the number of ways to eat all the cookies, it is important to use the correct formula for the binomial coefficient.
4. **Incorrect use of the factorial function.** The factorial function $n!$ gives the product of the first n positive integers. When computing the number of ways to eat all the cookies, it is important to use the correct formula for the factorial function.
5. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator % gives the remainder of a division operation. When computing the number of ways to eat all the cookies, it is important to use the correct formula for the modulo operator.
6. **Incorrect use of the exponentiation operator.** The exponentiation operator ** raises a number to a power. When computing the number of ways to eat all the cookies, it is important to use the correct formula for the exponentiation operator.
7. **Incorrect use of the logarithm function.** The logarithm function log(x) gives the logarithm of x to the base 10. When computing the number of ways to eat all the cookies, it is important to use the correct formula for the logarithm function.
8. **Incorrect use of the trigonometric functions.** The trigonometric functions sin(x) and cos(x) give the sine and cosine of x, respectively. When computing the number of ways to eat all the cookies, it is important to use the correct formulas for the trigonometric functions.
9. **Incorrect use of the hyperbolic functions.** The hyperbolic functions sinh(x) and cosh(x) give the hyperbolic sine and cosine of x, respectively. When computing the number of ways to eat all the cookies, it is important to use the correct formulas for the hyperbolic functions.

Title:
AIZU p02274 The Number of Inversions

Pain points:
### 1. **Not using the correct data structure**

The problem states that the input array is of size $n \leq 200,000$. This means that we can't use an array to store the input, as an array of size 200,000 would take up too much memory. Instead, we need to use a data structure that is more efficient in terms of memory usage.

One possible solution is to use a linked list. A linked list is a data structure that consists of a series of nodes, each of which contains a data value and a pointer to the next node in the list. Linked lists are very efficient in terms of memory usage, as they only store the data values of the nodes in the list, and not the pointers to the next nodes.

Another possible solution is to use a hash table. A hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to values. Hash tables are very efficient in terms of lookup time, as the hash function allows us to quickly find the value associated with a given key.

### 2. **Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem states that we need to find the number of inversions in the input array. One possible way to do this is to use a merge sort algorithm. Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by recursively splitting the input array into smaller and smaller subarrays until each subarray contains only one element. The merge sort algorithm then merges the subarrays together in order, counting the number of inversions as it goes.

However, the merge sort algorithm has a time complexity of $O(n \log n)$, which is too slow for this problem. A faster solution is to use a counting sort algorithm. Counting sort is a sorting algorithm that works by counting the number of occurrences of each element in the input array. The counting sort algorithm then uses this information to sort the input array in linear time.

### 3. **Incorrect implementation**

Even if you use the correct data structure and algorithm, you still need to implement them correctly in order to get the correct answer. One common mistake is to forget to initialize the data structures. Another common mistake is to make a mistake in the algorithm implementation.

Here are some tips for avoiding these mistakes:

* **Use a debugger to step through your code and check for errors.**
* **Test your code with small test cases before you try to solve the actual problem.**
* **Read the problem statement carefully and make sure you understand what you need to do.**
* **Ask for help if you get stuck.**

### 4. **Time limit exceeded**

The time limit for this problem is 2 seconds. This means that your solution must run in under 2 seconds in order to pass the test cases. If your solution takes longer than 2 seconds, it will be marked as incorrect.

There are a few things you can do to reduce the time complexity of your solution. One way is to use a more efficient data structure. Another way is to use a more efficient algorithm. You can also try to parallelize your code to run on multiple cores.

Here are some tips for reducing the time complexity of your solution:

* **Use a data structure that is more efficient for the problem you are trying to solve.**
* **Use an algorithm that is more efficient for the problem you are trying to solve.**
* **Parallelize your code to run on multiple cores.**
* **Use a compiler that optimizes your code.**

### 5. **Memory limit exceeded**

The memory limit for this problem is 256 MB. This means that your solution must use less than 256 MB of memory in order to pass the test cases. If your solution uses more than 256 MB of memory, it will be marked as incorrect.

There are a few things you can do to reduce the memory usage of your solution. One way is to use a data structure that is more memory efficient. Another way is to use an algorithm that is more memory efficient. You can also try to free up memory as your solution runs.

Here are some tips for reducing the memory usage of your solution:

* **Use a data structure that is more memory efficient.**
* **Use an algorithm that is more memory efficient.**
* **Free up memory as your solution runs.**
* **Use a compiler that optimizes your code.**

### 6. **Incorrect output**

The output for this problem is the number of inversions in the input array. If your solution does not output the correct number of inversions, it will be marked as incorrect.

There are a few things you can do to check the
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect data structure**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Incorrect data structure
count = 0
for i in range(n - 1):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        if a[i] > a[j]:
            count += 1

print(count)
```

This solution will not pass the time limit, because it uses a list to store the input array. A list is a very inefficient data structure for this problem, because it takes O(n) time to access an element in a list.

2. **Using the wrong algorithm**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Incorrect algorithm
count = 0
for i in range(n - 1):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        if a[i] > a[j]:
            count += 1

print(count)
```

This solution will not pass the time limit, because it uses a bubble sort algorithm to find the number of inversions. Bubble sort is a very inefficient algorithm for this problem, because it has a time complexity of O(n^2).

3. **Incorrect implementation**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Incorrect implementation
count = 0
for i in range(n - 1):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        if a[i] > a[j]:
            count += 1

print(count)
```

This solution will not pass the time limit, because it does not use a counting sort algorithm to find the number of inversions. Counting sort is a much faster algorithm for this problem, because it has a time complexity of O(n).

4. **Time limit exceeded**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Incorrect algorithm
count = 0
for i in range(n - 1):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        if a[i] > a[j]:
            count += 1

print(count)
```

This solution will not pass the time limit, because the bubble sort algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2).

5. **Memory limit exceeded**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Incorrect data structure
count = 0
for i in range(n - 1):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        if a[i] > a[j]:
            count += 1

print(count)
```

This solution will not pass the memory limit, because it uses a list to store the input array. A list is a very inefficient data structure for this problem, because it takes O(n) time to access an element in a list.

6. **Incorrect output**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Incorrect output
count = 0
for i in range(n - 1):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        if a[i] > a[j]:
            count += 1

print(count + 1)
```

This solution will not pass the output test, because it outputs the number of inversions plus 1. The correct output should be the number of inversions.

Here are some correct program inputs that will validate whether an implementation meets each of the requirements:

1. **Correct data structure**

```
n = int(input())
a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

# Correct algorithm
count = 0
for i in range(n - 1):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        if a[i] > a[j]:
            count += 1

print(count)
```

This solution uses a counting sort algorithm to find the number of inversions. The counting sort algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), so it will pass the time limit. The counting sort algorithm also uses a very small amount of memory, so it will pass the memory limit.
