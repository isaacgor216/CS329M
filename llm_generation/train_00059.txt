Title:
CODECHEF cmb02

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input numbers can be up to 5 digits long, so we need to use a data type that can store numbers of that size. If we use a smaller data type, such as an integer, we may overflow the number and get incorrect results.

**2. Not handling negative numbers correctly**

The problem statement specifies that the input numbers should be positive. If we accidentally input a negative number, our code may not work correctly. We need to make sure that we check for negative numbers and handle them appropriately.

**3. Not handling palindromes that start with a zero**

The problem statement specifies that numbers should be displayed without leading zeros. However, some palindromes start with a zero, such as 0000. We need to make sure that we handle these palindromes correctly and output them without leading zeros.

**4. Not handling palindromes that are larger than the maximum value of the data type**

The problem statement specifies that the input numbers should be no more than 5 digits long. However, it is possible for a palindrome to be larger than the maximum value of the data type. We need to make sure that we handle these cases correctly and output an error message.

Title:
CODECHEF flow013

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type to store the angles**

The angles of a triangle can be any real number between 0 and 180 degrees. However, if you store the angles as integers, you will lose precision and may get incorrect results. For example, if you store an angle of 45.5 degrees as an integer, it will be rounded down to 45 degrees. This could cause your program to incorrectly identify a triangle as valid when it is actually invalid.

**2. Using the wrong formula to calculate the sum of the angles**

The sum of the angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. However, some developers may mistakenly use the formula 180 - A - B to calculate the third angle, C. This is incorrect because it does not take into account the possibility that A and B could be equal. The correct formula for calculating the third angle is C = 180 - (A + B).

**3. Not handling degenerate triangles**

A degenerate triangle is a triangle with zero area. This can happen when two of the angles are equal to 180 degrees. Degenerate triangles are not valid triangles, so your program should handle them accordingly. One way to do this is to check if the sum of the angles is greater than 180 degrees. If it is, then the triangle is degenerate and you can output an error message.

**4. Not handling invalid input**

The input to your program may contain invalid values, such as negative angles or angles greater than 180 degrees. Your program should handle these invalid inputs gracefully. One way to do this is to check the input for validity before you attempt to calculate the sum of the angles. If the input is invalid, you can output an error message and terminate the program.

**5. Using incorrect indentation**

Incorrect indentation can make your code difficult to read and understand. This can lead to errors, as it can be difficult to see which lines of code belong to which blocks of code. Make sure to use consistent indentation throughout your code, and use a style guide to help you format your code correctly.

**6. Using incorrect variable names**

Using incorrect variable names can make your code difficult to read and understand. This can lead to errors, as it can be difficult to remember what each variable represents. Make sure to use descriptive variable names that clearly indicate what each variable is used for.

**7. Using incorrect operators**

Using incorrect operators can lead to errors in your code. For example, using the addition operator (+) instead of the subtraction operator (-) to calculate the third angle of a triangle could result in an incorrect answer. Make sure to use the correct operators for each operation, and double-check your code to make sure there are no errors.

**8. Not using comments**

Comments can help you to document your code and explain what each part of the code does. This can be helpful for other developers who may need to read your code, and it can also help you to remember what your code does if you come back to it later. Make sure to use comments throughout your code to make it as clear and easy to understand as possible.

Title:
CODECHEF lepermut

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The developer may not be familiar with the concept of a permutation.
* The developer may not be able to correctly count the number of inversions or local inversions in a permutation.
* The developer may not be able to correctly compare the number of inversions and local inversions to determine if a permutation is good.

Here are some specific examples of problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer may incorrectly count the number of inversions by only considering pairs of adjacent elements in the permutation.
* The developer may incorrectly count the number of local inversions by only considering pairs of elements where the first element is greater than the second element.
* The developer may incorrectly compare the number of inversions and local inversions by not taking into account the fact that a permutation may have more than one inversion or local inversion.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully review the problem statement and make sure that they understand the concept of a permutation and how to count the number of inversions and local inversions. The developer should also carefully test their code to make sure that it correctly identifies good permutations.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1056_F. Write The Contest

Pain points:
### 1. **Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very strict. However, there are a few things that you need to be careful about.

First, the number of test cases `tc` must be a positive integer. If you accidentally enter a negative number or a non-integer, your code will not work.

Second, the values of `C` and `T` must be positive real numbers. This means that they must be greater than zero and they must have a decimal point. If you accidentally enter a negative number, a non-integer, or a number without a decimal point, your code will not work.

Finally, the values of `a_i` and `p_i` must be positive integers. This means that they must be greater than zero and they must be whole numbers. If you accidentally enter a negative number or a non-integer, your code will not work.

### 2. **Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also not very strict. However, there are a few things that you need to be careful about.

First, your output must be a list of integers. This means that each element of your output must be a whole number. If you accidentally output a non-integer, your code will not work.

Second, the length of your output must be the same as the number of test cases. If you output a list that is shorter or longer than the number of test cases, your code will not work.

Finally, the values in your output must be the maximum possible score for each test case. If you output a score that is less than the maximum possible score, your code will not work.

### 3. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum possible score**

The maximum possible score for each test case is the sum of the scores of all the problems that can be solved in the given time limit. To calculate this score, you need to consider the following factors:

* The difficulty of each problem
* The time it takes to solve each problem
* The time it takes to watch an episode of the series
* The time it takes to train

You need to make sure that you take all of these factors into account when calculating the maximum possible score. If you make a mistake in your calculations, your code will not work.

### 4. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers**

The values of `C`, `T`, `a_i`, and `p_i` are all floating-point numbers. This means that they have a decimal point and they can be represented with a certain degree of precision.

When you are working with floating-point numbers, it is important to be aware of the following issues:

* Floating-point numbers are not exact. This means that they can be rounded off to a certain number of decimal places.
* Floating-point numbers can be imprecise. This means that they can be represented inaccurately, even if they are not rounded off.

If you are not careful when working with floating-point numbers, your code can produce incorrect results.

### 5. **Incorrect use of the `sorted()` function**

The `sorted()` function can be used to sort a list of elements in ascending or descending order. However, it is important to be aware of the following issues:

* The `sorted()` function does not preserve the original order of the elements in the list.
* The `sorted()` function can be inefficient if the list is large.

If you are not careful when using the `sorted()` function, your code can produce incorrect results or it can run slowly.

### 6. **Incorrect use of the `min()` and `max()` functions**

The `min()` and `max()` functions can be used to find the minimum and maximum values in a list of elements. However, it is important to be aware of the following issues:

* The `min()` and `max()` functions do not preserve the original order of the elements in the list.
* The `min()` and `max()` functions can be inefficient if the list is large.

If you are not careful when using the `min()` and `max()` functions, your code can produce incorrect results or it can run slowly.

### 7. **Incorrect use of the `bisect()` function**

The `bisect()` function can be used to find the index of an element in a sorted list. However, it is important to be aware of the following issues:

* The `bisect()` function does not work if the list is not sorted.
* The `bisect()` function can be inefficient if the list is large.

If you are not careful when using the `bisect()` function, your code can produce incorrect results or it

Title:
CODEFORCES 107_B. Basketball Team

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly and in the correct order. For example, if you were to read the first line of input as `n m h` instead of `n m h`, you would get the wrong answer.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the probability**

The probability that Herr Wafa will have at least one teammate from his department is equal to the number of ways to choose n - 1 players from the other departments divided by the total number of ways to choose n players from all departments. This can be a bit tricky to calculate, so it is important to make sure that you are doing it correctly.

**3. Using floating-point numbers**

The problem states that the answer must be rounded to an absolute or relative error of no more than 10^-6. This means that you cannot use floating-point numbers to calculate the answer, as they are not precise enough. Instead, you will need to use integers or rational numbers.

**4. Overflow errors**

When calculating the number of ways to choose n - 1 players from the other departments, you may get an overflow error if n is large. To avoid this, you can use the following formula:

```
nCr = n! / (r! * (n - r)!)
```

where nCr is the number of ways to choose r objects from a set of n objects.

**5. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem must be a single floating-point number rounded to an absolute or relative error of no more than 10^-6. This means that you cannot print the answer as a string or an integer. Instead, you will need to use the `round()` function to round the answer to the desired precision.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so the developer may accidentally parse the input incorrectly. For example, if the input is "123", the developer may incorrectly parse it as three integers "1", "2", and "3" instead of one integer "123".
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly defined, so the developer may accidentally output the answer in the wrong format. For example, if the answer is "47", the developer may incorrectly output it as "47.0" or "47 7".
3. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum lucky number**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the minimum lucky number. For example, if the sum of digits is 11, the developer may incorrectly calculate the minimum lucky number as "47" instead of "74".
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. The problem statement specifies some edge cases, such as the case where the sum of digits is 10. The developer must be careful to handle these edge cases correctly.
5. **Incorrect use of data structures**. The problem statement does not specify any specific data structures that must be used. The developer must choose the appropriate data structures carefully to avoid performance problems.
6. **Incorrect use of algorithms**. The problem statement does not specify any specific algorithms that must be used. The developer must choose the appropriate algorithms carefully to avoid performance problems.

CODEFORCES 1120_A. Diana and Liana

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to include a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is all integers, so it's important to make sure that you are reading the input into the correct data type. For example, if you try to read a string into an integer variable, the program will not be able to handle the input correctly.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. This problem is full of nested loops, so it's easy to make a mistake and miss one of the iterations. For example, if you forget to increment a counter in one of the loops, the program will not be able to finish correctly.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The logic for this problem is fairly complex, so it's easy to make a mistake. For example, if you forget to check for a certain condition, the program will not be able to handle all of the possible cases.
5. **Uninitialized variables**. It's important to initialize all of your variables before you use them. If you don't initialize a variable, the program will not be able to use it correctly.
6. **Memory leaks**. This problem does not require you to allocate any memory, so you don't need to worry about memory leaks.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

CODEFORCES 1147_C. Thanos Nim

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n, and the second line should contain n integers. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect calculation of n/2**

The game is played by alternating turns between Alice and Bob. On each turn, a player must choose exactly n/2 nonempty piles and independently remove a positive number of stones from each of the chosen piles. If n/2 is not an integer, the program will not be able to correctly calculate the number of piles that each player must choose, and will produce incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect determination of the winner**

The winner of the game is the player who is able to make a move when the other player cannot. If both players are unable to make a move, the game is a draw. The program must correctly determine which player is able to make a move and output the correct winner.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output must be a single string "Alice" or "Bob". If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly output the winner and will produce incorrect output.

**5. Other bugs**

There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:

* Incorrect handling of edge cases
* Incorrect use of data structures
* Incorrect logic
* Incorrect error handling

By carefully following the problem statement and avoiding these common pitfalls, developers can write code that correctly solves the Thanos Nim problem.

CODEFORCES 1223_C. Save the Nature

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format of the problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, you might accidentally read the number of tickets as a price, or you might forget to read one of the lines of input. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the contribution.** The contribution is calculated by multiplying the price of each ticket by the corresponding percentage, and then adding up the results. It's easy to make a mistake when doing this calculation, especially if you're not careful about the order of operations. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect choice of the minimum number of tickets to sell.** The minimum number of tickets to sell is the smallest number of tickets that you can sell and still reach the required contribution. It's easy to make a mistake when choosing this number, especially if you're not careful about the order in which you sell the tickets. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The output format of the problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, you might accidentally print the wrong number of tickets, or you might forget to add a newline character to the end of the output. This can lead to your submission being rejected.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1248_F. Catowice City

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very clear. It is not clear whether the first line of each test case should contain two integers (n and m) or three integers (n, m, and k). This can lead to errors if the developer does not correctly parse the input.

**2. Incorrect use of data structures**

The problem requires the developer to use a data structure to store the friendships between residents and cats. If the developer does not use a data structure that is appropriate for this task, it can lead to errors. For example, using a hash table to store the friendships would be inefficient, as it would require O(n) time to insert each friendship.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve this problem must be correct in order to produce the correct output. A common mistake that developers make is to use an incorrect algorithm, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, a developer might use a greedy algorithm to solve this problem, which would not always find the optimal solution.

**4. Incorrect implementation**

Even if the developer uses the correct algorithm and data structures, they still need to implement the solution correctly. This can be a difficult task, as there are many details that need to be considered. For example, the developer needs to make sure that the code is efficient and that it handles all possible cases.

**5. Incorrect testing**

The developer must test their solution to make sure that it is correct. This can be a difficult task, as it is often difficult to come up with test cases that cover all possible scenarios. For example, the developer needs to test the solution with different values of n and m, and with different sets of friendships.

**6. Incorrect debugging**

If the developer's solution does not produce the correct output, they need to be able to debug the code to find the error. This can be a difficult task, as it is often difficult to identify the source of the error. The developer needs to be able to carefully examine the code and identify the line of code that is causing the error.

2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values must be correct. For example, if the number of vertices is entered as a string instead of an integer, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be correct. For example, if the program tries to divide by zero, it will crash.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the program misses or adds one element to a list or array. This can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Indexing errors**. Indexing errors occur when the program accesses an element of a list or array that does not exist. This can lead to incorrect results or crashes.
6. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when the program fails to free up memory that it has allocated. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
7. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or crashes.
8. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can lead to the program being stuck and unable to continue.
9. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can occur when the program is not properly protected from malicious users. This can allow attackers to access sensitive data or take control of the program.

Title:
CODEFORCES 130_F. Prime factorization

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The most common mistake when solving this problem is to use an incorrect algorithm. For example, a naive algorithm would try to divide the input number by each prime number from 2 to the square root of the input number, and then multiply the factors together. This algorithm is incorrect because it does not take into account the possibility that the input number may be divisible by a prime number greater than the square root of the input number.

**2. Using an incorrect data structure**

Another common mistake is to use an incorrect data structure to store the prime factors of the input number. For example, a naive data structure would simply store the prime factors in a list. This data structure is incorrect because it does not take into account the possibility that the input number may have multiple occurrences of the same prime factor.

**3. Using an incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is very specific. The output must list the prime factors of the input number in non-decreasing order, and each factor must be printed the number of times it occurs in the prime factorization of the input number. A common mistake is to output the prime factors in the wrong order or to print each factor more than once.

**4. Not handling edge cases correctly**

The input for this problem can include edge cases, such as 1 or 2. A common mistake is to not handle these edge cases correctly. For example, a naive solution might try to divide 1 by 2, which would cause an error.

**5. Not using efficient algorithms**

The time complexity of the algorithm used to solve this problem can have a significant impact on the performance of the program. A common mistake is to use an inefficient algorithm, such as a brute-force algorithm. A more efficient algorithm, such as a Sieve of Eratosthenes, can significantly improve the performance of the program.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1437_D. Minimal Height Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of BFS**. The most common mistake is to implement BFS incorrectly. For example, you might forget to add the root to the queue or you might not remove the visited vertices from the queue. This will result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the tree height**. The height of a tree is the maximum distance from the root to a leaf. To calculate the height, you need to keep track of the depth of each vertex as you traverse the tree.
3. **Incorrect construction of the tree**. Once you have calculated the height of each vertex, you need to construct the tree. The easiest way to do this is to start with the root and then add the children of each vertex in order of their depth.
4. **Incorrect handling of duplicate vertices**. In the input, there may be duplicate vertices. This means that the same vertex may be visited multiple times during the BFS traversal. You need to handle duplicate vertices correctly in order to get the correct answer.
5. **Incorrect handling of disconnected components**. The input may contain multiple disconnected components. This means that there may be vertices that are not connected to the root. You need to handle disconnected components correctly in order to get the correct answer.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

1. **Test your implementation of BFS thoroughly**. Make sure that you can correctly find the depth of each vertex in the tree. You can do this by using a debugger or by printing the depth of each vertex as you traverse the tree.
2. **Use a recursive approach to calculate the tree height**. This will make the code much easier to write and debug.
3. **Use a data structure to store the tree**. This will make it easier to construct the tree and to handle duplicate vertices and disconnected components.
4. **Be careful when handling duplicate vertices**. Make sure that you only add each vertex to the tree once.
5. **Be careful when handling disconnected components**. Make sure that you only construct the tree for the connected component that contains the root.

CODEFORCES 1462_B. Last Year's Substring

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not very clear. It is not clear whether the first line of each test case contains the length of the string or the number of test cases. A developer may incorrectly assume that the first line contains the number of test cases and try to read the length of the string from the second line. This will result in an error.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is also not very clear. It is not clear whether the output should be in all capital letters or not. A developer may incorrectly assume that the output should be in all capital letters and get a wrong answer.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, a developer may incorrectly assume that the string "20192020" can be turned into "2020" by removing the substring "19". This is incorrect because the resulting string would be "20200".

**4. Incorrect test cases**

The test cases provided with the problem may be incorrect. For example, the test case "20192020" is incorrect because it does not contain the substring "2020". This could lead a developer to believe that the problem is impossible to solve when it is actually possible.

**5. Incorrect implementation**

The implementation of the algorithm may contain errors. For example, a developer may incorrectly use the `substr()` function to remove a substring from a string. This could lead to an incorrect answer.

CODEFORCES 1538_E. Funny Substrings

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The problem states that all variable names and strings only consist of lowercase letters of the English alphabet and do not exceed 5 characters. However, a developer may accidentally use a data type that is too large, such as an integer, to store a string. This could lead to errors when the program is run.

**2. Forgetting to initialize variables**

The problem states that the first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the number of statements in the program. However, a developer may forget to initialize the variables used in the program. This could lead to errors when the program is run.

**3. Using incorrect operators**

The problem states that the only two types of statements in the new programming language are "x := s" and "x = a + b". However, a developer may accidentally use an incorrect operator, such as "x = s + a", in their program. This could lead to errors when the program is run.

**4. Misunderstanding the problem statement**

The problem statement is very clear and concise. However, a developer may still misunderstand the problem and make incorrect assumptions. This could lead to errors when the program is run.

**5. Using incorrect logic**

The problem requires the developer to calculate the number of occurrences of the haha substring in the string that was written to the variable in the last statement. However, a developer may use incorrect logic to solve this problem. This could lead to errors when the program is run.

Title:
CODEFORCES 232_B. Table

Pain points:
**1. Using the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++.**

This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The %lld specifier is only supported by the C++11 standard and later, so if you are using an older compiler, you will need to use a different specifier. Additionally, the %lld specifier can only be used with integer types that are at least 64 bits wide, so if you are trying to read or write a value that is smaller than 64 bits, you will also get incorrect results.

**2. Not considering the fact that John Doe always paints a point exactly in the center of some cell.**

This is an important detail that can easily be overlooked. If you forget to take this into account, your solution will not be correct.

**3. Not considering the fact that two ways to fill a table are considered distinct if there exists a table cell, that has a point in one way and doesn't have it in the other.**

This is another important detail that can easily be overlooked. If you forget to take this into account, your solution will not be correct.

**4. Using an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem.**

There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. However, not all of them are correct. It is important to make sure that the algorithm you are using is correct before you submit your solution.

**5. Not handling the input and output correctly.**

The input and output for this problem are both given in a single line. It is important to make sure that you are reading and writing the input and output correctly.

**6. Not getting the correct answer.**

Even if you have followed all of the steps above, it is still possible to get the wrong answer. This could be due to a number of factors, such as a mistake in your algorithm, a mistake in your implementation, or a mistake in your understanding of the problem. It is important to carefully check your work to make sure that you have gotten the correct answer.

Title:
CODEFORCES 330_A. Cakeminator

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type to store the input**

The input consists of two integers r and c, followed by r lines of c characters. If we use an integer to store r and c, we will lose precision and get the wrong answer. For example, if r = 1000000000, we will only be able to store the value 2147483647, which is less than r.

To avoid this problem, we should use a long long int to store r and c.

**2. Not handling the case where there are no empty cells**

The cakeminator can only eat cells that do not contain any evil strawberries. If there are no empty cells, the cakeminator cannot eat anything. We need to handle this case by returning 0.

**3. Not handling the case where all the cells are empty**

If all the cells are empty, the cakeminator can eat all of them. We need to handle this case by returning r * c.

**4. Not handling the case where there are no evil strawberries**

If there are no evil strawberries, the cakeminator can eat all of the cells. We need to handle this case by returning r * c.

**5. Using a brute force approach**

A brute force approach to this problem would be to iterate over all possible ways to eat the cake, and find the maximum number of cells that can be eaten. This approach would be very inefficient, and would not be able to solve large instances of the problem.

**6. Using a dynamic programming approach**

A dynamic programming approach to this problem would be to build a table of the maximum number of cells that can be eaten from each row and column. We can then use this table to find the maximum number of cells that can be eaten overall. This approach would be much more efficient than a brute force approach, and would be able to solve large instances of the problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 447_A. DZY Loves Hash

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong hash function**

The problem states that the hash function is h(x) = x mod p. However, some developers may accidentally use a different hash function, such as h(x) = x / p. This will result in incorrect results.

**2. Not using a collision-resistant hash function**

A collision-resistant hash function is a hash function that is not susceptible to collisions, i.e., two different inputs do not map to the same output. If a developer uses a non-collision-resistant hash function, then it is possible that two different numbers will map to the same bucket, which will result in a conflict.

**3. Not using a sufficiently large hash table**

If the hash table is not sufficiently large, then it is possible that two different numbers will map to the same bucket, even if the hash function is collision-resistant. This is because there is a finite number of buckets, and if the number of numbers is too large, then it is statistically likely that some of the numbers will map to the same bucket.

**4. Not handling conflicts correctly**

If a conflict occurs, the developer needs to handle it correctly. The most common way to handle conflicts is to use a chaining hash table. A chaining hash table is a hash table that uses linked lists to store the elements that map to the same bucket. This allows the developer to insert elements into the hash table even if there are conflicts, and to find elements in the hash table even if they have been overwritten by other elements.

**5. Not testing the code correctly**

It is important to test the code correctly to ensure that it is working correctly. This includes testing for all possible errors, such as incorrect hash functions, non-collision-resistant hash functions, insufficient hash table size, and incorrect handling of conflicts.

By following these tips, developers can avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving the DZY Loves Hash problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 491_A. Up the hill

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible that the user will enter data in an incorrect format. For example, they may enter a negative number for the number of days of climbing up the hill or a number greater than N for the number of days of walking down the hill. In this case, the program should output an error message and terminate.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not strictly defined, but it is generally expected that the output will be a list of N space-separated integers from 1 to N inclusive. If the user outputs anything else, the program should output an error message and terminate.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the possible stop heights**

The program should calculate the possible stop heights by finding all of the integers from 1 to N that are not divisible by A or B. However, it is possible that the user will enter values for A and B such that no such integers exist. In this case, the program should output an empty list.

**4. Runtime errors**

The program should be written in a way that it does not crash or hang when it is run. This means that the program should be well-structured and use appropriate data structures and algorithms.

**5. Memory leaks**

The program should not leak memory. This means that the program should release all of the memory that it allocates when it is finished running.

**6. Security vulnerabilities**

The program should not contain any security vulnerabilities. This means that the program should not allow users to do anything that they should not be able to do, such as read or write files that they do not have permission to access.

**7. Usability problems**

The program should be easy to use. This means that the program should have a well-designed user interface and that it should provide clear and concise error messages.

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect input format:** The input format of the problem is not correctly parsed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is `2 3`, `0`, `1 0`, `1 2`, the program may incorrectly parse the input as `2 3`, `0`, `1 0 2`, which will lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect logic:** The logic of the program may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may incorrectly assume that all boys and girls are happy at the beginning, which will lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect implementation:** The implementation of the program may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may incorrectly use the modulo operator, which will lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect testing:** The testing of the program may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may only test a few small cases, which may not be sufficient to catch all bugs.

**Here are some tips to avoid these problems:**

1. Carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand the input format and output format.
2. Write unit tests to verify the correctness of your code.
3. Use a debugger to step through your code and find any bugs.
4. Ask for help from other programmers if you are stuck.

CODEFORCES 542_C. Idempotent functions

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain spaces between the numbers, or the numbers may be separated by a new line instead of a comma. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format must also be correctly followed. For example, the output must be a single integer, and it must not contain any spaces or new lines. If the output format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When iterating over a list of numbers, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. This can cause the program to skip a number or count a number twice. This can lead to incorrect results.

**4. Undefined behavior**

Some programming languages allow undefined behavior, which means that the program can behave in any way that the compiler chooses. This can lead to incorrect results or security vulnerabilities.

**5. Memory leaks**

When a program allocates memory, it must eventually free that memory. If a program does not free all of the memory that it allocates, it will eventually run out of memory and crash.

**6. Race conditions**

When multiple threads of execution access the same data at the same time, it is possible for them to interfere with each other. This can lead to incorrect results or security vulnerabilities.

**7. Deadlocks**

When two or more threads of execution are waiting for each other to finish, it is possible for them to get stuck in a deadlock. This means that neither thread can continue, and the program will eventually crash.

**8. Buffer overflows**

When a program writes data to a buffer that is not large enough, it can overwrite adjacent memory. This can lead to incorrect results or security vulnerabilities.

**9. Integer overflows**

When a program performs an arithmetic operation on an integer that is too large, the result can be incorrect. This can lead to incorrect results or security vulnerabilities.

**10. Floating-point errors**

Floating-point numbers are not exact representations of real numbers. This can lead to rounding errors, which can affect the accuracy of calculations.

Title:
CODEFORCES 569_D. Symmetric and Transitive

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specified in the problem statement is `A single line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 4000)`. However, a developer may accidentally input a line that does not contain a single integer or an integer that is not in the specified range. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of relations.** The number of relations that are symmetric, transitive, but not equivalence relations can be calculated using the following formula:

```
N = (n * (n - 1) / 2) * (n - 1)!
```

However, a developer may make a mistake in the calculation of this formula, which could lead to incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect modulo operation.** The output of the program must be the remainder of the number of relations divided by 109 + 7. However, a developer may accidentally perform the division operation instead of the modulo operation, which could lead to incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect use of the `mod()` function.** The `mod()` function in Python takes two arguments: the dividend and the divisor. The result of the `mod()` function is the remainder of the division of the dividend by the divisor. However, a developer may accidentally use the `mod()` function with only one argument, which will cause the function to return the value of the dividend instead of the remainder.
5. **Incorrect use of the `pow()` function.** The `pow()` function in Python takes two arguments: the base and the exponent. The result of the `pow()` function is the base raised to the power of the exponent. However, a developer may accidentally use the `pow()` function with only one argument, which will cause the function to return the value of the base.

Title:
CODEFORCES 590_B. Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is given in the form of a text file. The first line contains four integers x1, y1, x2, y2, which are the coordinates of the rescue headquarters and the distress signal. The second line contains two integers v and t, which are the maximum speed of the airship and the time when the wind changes. The next two lines contain two pairs of integers (vx, vy) and (wx, wy), which describe the wind for the first t seconds and the wind that will blow at all the remaining time. It is guaranteed that v > 0 and t <= 1000.

However, the input data may contain incorrect values. For example, the first line may contain a string instead of four integers. Or, the second line may contain a negative value for v. In these cases, the program should raise an error.

**2. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm for solving this problem is relatively simple. First, we need to calculate the distance between the rescue headquarters and the distress signal. Then, we need to calculate the time it takes to travel this distance at the maximum speed of the airship. Finally, we need to add the time it takes for the wind to change.

However, the algorithm may be incorrect if we make a mistake in the calculations. For example, we may forget to add the time it takes for the wind to change. Or, we may calculate the distance between the rescue headquarters and the distress signal incorrectly.

**3. Incorrect implementation**

The algorithm for solving this problem can be implemented in a variety of programming languages. However, the implementation may be incorrect if we make a mistake in the code. For example, we may forget to declare a variable or we may use the wrong operator.

**4. Incorrect testing**

Once we have implemented the algorithm, we need to test it to make sure that it is correct. We can do this by creating a set of test cases and running the algorithm on each test case. If the algorithm produces the correct output for all of the test cases, then we can be confident that it is correct.

However, the testing may be incorrect if we create a set of test cases that does not test all of the possible inputs. For example, we may create a set of test cases that only tests inputs with positive values. In this case, the algorithm may not be correct for inputs with negative values.

**5. Incorrect documentation**

Once we have implemented and tested the algorithm, we need to document it so that other developers can understand how it works. The documentation should include a description of the algorithm, a list of the inputs and outputs, and a set of test cases.

However, the documentation may be incorrect if we forget to include important information. For example, we may forget to include a description of the algorithm or we may not include a list of the inputs and outputs.

**6. Incorrect deployment**

Once we have implemented, tested, and documented the algorithm, we need to deploy it so that it can be used by other developers. The deployment process may be incorrect if we make a mistake in the installation process. For example, we may install the algorithm in the wrong location or we may not install all of the required dependencies.

**7. Incorrect usage**

Once the algorithm has been deployed, other developers may use it to solve problems. However, the usage of the algorithm may be incorrect if the developers do not understand how it works. For example, the developers may use the algorithm on inputs that are not supported.

**8. Incorrect maintenance**

Once the algorithm has been deployed, it is important to maintain it so that it continues to work correctly. The maintenance process may be incorrect if we make a mistake in the update process. For example, we may update the algorithm with a new version that is not compatible with the old version.

CODEFORCES 612_A. The Text Splitting

Pain points:
1. The input data may not be valid. For example, `n` may be negative or greater than 100, or `p` and `q` may be equal to 0 or greater than `n`.
2. The input string may contain invalid characters. For example, it may contain non-alphabetic characters or numbers.
3. The output may not be valid. For example, it may contain a negative number or a number greater than the number of strings in the partition.
4. The output may not be in the correct format. For example, it may not contain the correct number of lines, or it may not contain the correct strings on each line.
5. The program may not be efficient. For example, it may take a long time to run or it may use a lot of memory.
6. The program may not be correct. For example, it may not produce the correct output for all valid input data.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input data and to make sure that the output is valid and in the correct format. It is also important to design the program carefully and to use efficient algorithms.

Title:
CODEFORCES 632_A. Grandma Laura and Apples

Pain points:
In the second sample at the start of the day the grandma had three apples. First she sold a half of the third apple and gave a half of the third apple as a present to the first buyer. Then she sold a half of the second apple and gave a half of the second apple as a present to the second buyer. Finally she sold a half of the first apple.
 1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain an extra space between two integers, or the cost of an apple may not be an even number.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The total money that grandma should have at the end of the day is not calculated correctly. For example, the total number of apples sold may be incorrect, or the cost of an apple may be incorrectly multiplied by the number of apples sold.
4. **Memory overflow**. The total number of apples sold may be too large, and the integer type used to store the total money may not be large enough.
5. **Time limit exceeded**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be too slow.
Test inputs:

CODEFORCES 683_H. Exchange of Books

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is `n k`, where `n` is the number of pupils and `k` is the number of days. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to read the input correctly and will output an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format for this problem is `n` integers, where the `i`th integer is the number of the pupil who will have the book that the pupil with the number `i` had in the beginning, after `k` days. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to output the answer correctly.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program should be correct in order to output the correct answer. There are a few common logic errors that developers may make when solving this problem.
    * **Not considering the case where `k` is even.** If `k` is even, then the exchange of books will occur twice. The first exchange will occur on day `k / 2` and the second exchange will occur on day `k / 2 + 1`.
    * **Not considering the case where `k` is odd.** If `k` is odd, then the exchange of books will occur only once. The exchange will occur on day `k`.
    * **Not using the correct data structure to store the list of best friends.** The list of best friends should be stored in a data structure that allows for efficient lookups. A hash table or a binary search tree would be a good choice.
4. **Incorrect implementation.** The implementation of the program should be correct in order to output the correct answer. There are a few common implementation errors that developers may make when solving this problem.
    * **Using the wrong data type for the list of best friends.** The list of best friends should be stored in a data type that can store integers. A vector or a list would be a good choice.
    * **Using the wrong data type for the number of days.** The number of days should be stored in a data type that can store integers. A long long int would be a good choice.
    * **Using the wrong data type for the indices of the list of best friends.** The indices of the list of best friends should be stored in a data type that can store integers. A long long int would be a good choice.
5. **Incorrect testing.** The program should be tested thoroughly in order to ensure that it outputs the correct answer. There are a few common testing errors that developers may make when solving this problem.
    * **Not testing the program with different input values.** The program should be tested with different input values, including values that are out of range.
    * **Not testing the program with different values of `k`.** The program should be tested with different values of `k`, including values that are even and odd.
    * **Not testing the program with different data structures for the list of best friends.** The program should be tested with different data structures for the list of best friends, including hash tables and binary search trees.

CODEFORCES 707_B. Bakery

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type.** The input data may be in incorrect format, e.g., a string instead of an integer. This can lead to incorrect results or errors.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over a list or array, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one element or count one element twice. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Indexing errors.** When accessing elements of a list or array, it is important to make sure that the index is within the bounds of the list or array. Otherwise, you may get an error or incorrect results.
4. **Logic errors.** The logic of your code may be incorrect, leading to incorrect results. This can be caused by a number of factors, such as using the wrong data type, making a mistake in your calculations, or not handling all possible cases.
5. **Memory leaks.** Your code may not be releasing memory that it is no longer using. This can lead to your program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions.** When multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is possible for them to interfere with each other, leading to incorrect results or errors.
7. **Deadlocks.** When multiple threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, it is possible for them to get stuck in a deadlock, where no thread can make progress.
8. **Security vulnerabilities.** Your code may be vulnerable to security attacks, such as buffer overflows or SQL injection. This can allow attackers to access your data or take control of your system.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully test your code and use a debugger to find any errors. You should also be aware of the common pitfalls that can lead to errors in your code.
Test inputs:
**Incorrect data type:**

```
n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
```

This code will fail if the input data is not in the correct format, e.g., if the first line of input contains a string instead of an integer.

**Off-by-one errors:**

```
for u, v, l in edges:
    if u == v:
        print(-1)
        break
```

This code will fail if there is a self-loop in the graph, i.e., an edge from a vertex to itself. In this case, the loop will be counted twice, which will lead to an incorrect answer.

**Indexing errors:**

```
dist = [float('inf')] * n
for _ in range(m):
    u, v, l = map(int, input().split())
    dist[v] = min(dist[v], dist[u] + l)
```

This code will fail if the input data is not in the correct format, e.g., if the first line of input contains more than three integers. In this case, the code will try to access the dist array at index m, which is out of bounds.

**Logic errors:**

```
min_dist = float('inf')
for i in range(n):
    if i not in storages:
        dist = [float('inf')] * n
        for u, v, l in edges:
            dist[v] = min(dist[v], dist[u] + l)
        min_dist = min(min_dist, dist[storages[0]])
print(min_dist)
```

This code will fail if there is no storage in the graph. In this case, the code will try to access the storages array at index 0, which is out of bounds.

**Memory leaks:**

```
def dfs(u, visited):
    visited[u] = True
    for v in graph[u]:
        if not visited[v]:
            dfs(v, visited)

n, m = map(int, input().split())
graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
for _ in range(m):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    graph[u].append(v)

visited = [False] * n
dfs(0, visited)
for v in range(n):
    if not visited[v]:
        print(-1)
        exit(0)

print(sum(visited))
```

This code will leak memory because the visited array is never freed.

**Race conditions:**

```
def increment(x):
    global counter
    counter += 1

def decrement(x):
    global counter
    counter -= 1

def main():
    counter = 0
    t = threading.Thread(target=increment, args=(1,))
    t2 = threading.Thread(target=decrement, args=(1,))
    t.start()
    t2.start()
    t.join()
    t2.join()
    print(counter)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This code will fail if two threads try to increment or decrement the counter at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results.

**Deadlocks:**

```
def acquire_lock(lock):
    lock.acquire()
    try:
        # do something
    finally:
        lock.release()

def main():
    lock1 = threading.Lock()
    lock2 = threading.Lock()
    t1 = threading.Thread(target=acquire_lock, args=(lock1,))
    t2 = threading.Thread(target=acquire_lock, args=(lock2,))
    t1.start()
    t2.start()
    t1.join()
    t2.join()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This code will deadlock because the two threads are trying to acquire two locks in the opposite order. This can lead to the threads waiting indefinitely for each other to release the locks.

**Security vulnerabilities:**

```

Title:
CODEFORCES 72_C. Extraordinarily Nice Numbers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input type**. The input is expected to be a single integer, but the user may accidentally enter a string or a list of integers. This can be caught by using the `int()` function to convert the input to an integer.
2. **Incorrect output type**. The output is expected to be a single string, but the user may accidentally output a number or a list of strings. This can be caught by using the `str()` function to convert the output to a string.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The user may incorrectly implement the logic for determining whether a number is extraordinarily nice. This can be caught by testing the code on a variety of inputs and ensuring that the correct output is produced.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The user may accidentally count the number of odd or even divisors incorrectly. This can be caught by carefully checking the code for errors.
5. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other possible bugs that the user may encounter when solving this problem. These include:
    * Using the wrong data type
    * Using the wrong operator
    * Forgetting to initialize a variable
    * Misspelling a function name
    * Making a logical error
    * Using an incorrect algorithm

By following these tips, you can help to avoid common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

CODEFORCES 74_E. Shift It!

Pain points:
```
Possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format.** The input data is a 6x6 array of characters, but the developer may accidentally read it as a 1x60 array. This would cause the program to incorrectly identify the characters in the input data and produce incorrect output.
* **Incorrect output format.** The output of the program should be a list of operations that solve the puzzle. However, the developer may accidentally print the operations in the wrong order or with incorrect formatting. This would make it difficult for the user to understand how to solve the puzzle.
* **Incorrect logic.** The program must correctly identify the sequence of operations that solve the puzzle. However, the developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program, which would cause it to produce incorrect output.
* **Inefficient algorithm.** The program must solve the puzzle in a reasonable amount of time. However, the developer may use an inefficient algorithm that takes too long to run. This could make the program unusable for large puzzles.
* **Memory errors.** The program must not use too much memory. However, the developer may accidentally allocate too much memory, which could cause the program to crash.
* **Security vulnerabilities.** The program must not contain any security vulnerabilities. However, the developer may accidentally introduce a vulnerability, which could allow an attacker to exploit the program.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully review the input format, output format, logic, algorithm, and memory usage of their programs. They should also perform unit tests and security tests to ensure that their programs are correct and secure.

CODEFORCES 773_D. Perishable Roads

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly and in the correct format. Some common mistakes that people make include:

* Not reading the input correctly. For example, if the input is a list of numbers, you might accidentally read it as a string.
* Using the wrong data type for the input. For example, if the input is a list of integers, you might accidentally read it as a list of strings.
* Misinterpreting the input. For example, if the input is a list of numbers, you might accidentally think that it is a list of cities.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also very specific. It is important to make sure that you are writing the output correctly and in the correct format. Some common mistakes that people make include:

* Not writing the output correctly. For example, if the output is a list of numbers, you might accidentally write it as a string.
* Using the wrong data type for the output. For example, if the output is a list of integers, you might accidentally write it as a list of strings.
* Misinterpreting the output. For example, if the output is a list of numbers, you might accidentally think that it is a list of cities.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm that you use to solve this problem is very important. If you use an incorrect algorithm, you will not get the correct answer. Some common mistakes that people make include:

* Using an incorrect data structure. For example, if the input is a list of numbers, you might accidentally use a hash table to store the data.
* Using an incorrect algorithm. For example, if the input is a list of numbers, you might accidentally use a sorting algorithm to find the minimum value.
* Misunderstanding the problem. For example, if the problem is to find the minimum value in a list of numbers, you might accidentally think that you need to find the maximum value.

**4. Incorrect implementation**

Even if you have the correct algorithm, you still need to implement it correctly in order to get the correct answer. Some common mistakes that people make include:

* Using incorrect variable names. For example, if you are using a variable to store the minimum value, you might accidentally name it "maximum".
* Using incorrect operators. For example, if you are comparing two numbers, you might accidentally use the "<" operator instead of the ">" operator.
* Misunderstanding the code. For example, if you are using a for loop, you might accidentally forget to increment the loop variable.

**5. Runtime errors**

Your code might also run into runtime errors. Some common runtime errors include:

* Index out of bounds errors. For example, if you are trying to access an element in a list that does not exist, you will get an index out of bounds error.
* Division by zero errors. For example, if you try to divide a number by zero, you will get a division by zero error.
* Null pointer exceptions. For example, if you try to access a variable that has not been initialized, you will get a null pointer exception.

**6. Memory leaks**

Your code might also leak memory. Memory leaks occur when you allocate memory for a variable but do not free it when you are done with it. This can eventually cause your program to run out of memory and crash.

**7. Other errors**

There are a number of other errors that you could encounter when solving this problem. Some common examples include:

* Syntax errors. For example, if you forget to close a parenthesis or curly brace, you will get a syntax error.
* Logical errors. For example, if you are trying to solve a math problem but you make a mistake in your calculations, you will get a logical error.
* Spelling errors. For example, if you spell a variable name incorrectly, you will get a compiler error.

CODEFORCES 818_E. Card Game Again

Pain points:
 1. The product of the numbers in the resulting deck is 6 * 2 * 8 = 1152, which is divisible by 4. 
  2. The product of the numbers in the resulting deck is 6 * 2 * 8 = 1152, which is divisible by 4. 
  3. The product of the numbers in the resulting deck is 6 * 2 * 8 = 1152, which is divisible by 4. 
  4. The product of the numbers in the resulting deck is 6 * 8 = 48, which is divisible by 4.
 1. **Incorrect logic.** The developer may incorrectly assume that the product of all numbers in the new deck must be divisible by k. This is not always the case; for example, if k is prime and the new deck contains only one number, then the product of the numbers in the new deck will not be divisible by k.
2. **Incorrect implementation.** The developer may incorrectly implement the algorithm for finding the number of ways to choose x and y so the resulting deck is valid. For example, the developer may incorrectly count the number of ways to choose x and y if the new deck contains duplicate numbers.
3. **Incorrect input validation.** The developer may incorrectly validate the input. For example, the developer may not check that n and k are positive integers, or that the numbers in the second line are positive integers.
4. **Incorrect output formatting.** The developer may incorrectly format the output. For example, the developer may not print the number of ways to choose x and y on a single line, or the developer may not print the number of ways to choose x and y in the correct format.
5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the developer may incorrectly handle edge cases, or the developer may make a mistake in their calculations.

CODEFORCES 864_D. Make a Permutation!

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly specified. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or it may contain multiple spaces between two integers. The developer should make sure that the input is correctly formatted before processing it.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correctly specified. For example, the output may contain a number that is not an integer, or it may contain multiple spaces between two integers. The developer should make sure that the output is correctly formatted before printing it.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the algorithm may not find the lexicographically minimal permutation, or it may not find the permutation with the minimum number of changes. The developer should carefully design and implement the algorithm to ensure that it is correct.
4. **Incorrect data structures**. The developer may use incorrect data structures to store the input data or the output data. For example, the developer may use a linked list to store the input data, which is not efficient for this problem. The developer should carefully choose the data structures to use to ensure that the program runs efficiently.
5. **Incorrect error handling**. The developer may not handle errors correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 88_C. Trains

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains two integers, so you should use `int` to store them. If you use a smaller data type, such as `short`, you may get incorrect results.

**2. Not considering the case when two trains arrive at the same time**

The problem states that "If two trains approach at the same time, Vasya goes toward the direction with the lower frequency of going trains". So you need to handle this case correctly.

**3. Not considering the case when Vasya descends to the subway at the same time as a train arrives**

The problem states that "Vasya descends into the subway at some time, waits the first train to come and rides on it to the end of the branch to the corresponding girl". So you need to handle this case correctly.

**4. Not considering the case when Vasya descends to the subway at a time when no train is arriving**

The problem states that "Vasya descends into the subway at some time, waits the first train to come and rides on it to the end of the branch to the corresponding girl". So you need to handle this case correctly.

**5. Using incorrect logic**

The problem is not as simple as it seems. You need to think carefully about the solution.

Title:
CODEFORCES 913_A. Modular Exponentiation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem states that the first line should contain a single integer n, and the second line should contain a single integer m. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce an incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The problem states that we need to calculate ```<image>```, where ```<image>``` denotes the remainder of division of ```x``` by ```y```. If the calculation is incorrect, the program will produce an incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When calculating the remainder of division, it is important to be careful about off-by-one errors. For example, if we are calculating the remainder of ```10``` divided by ```5```, we need to subtract ```1``` from ```10``` to get ```9```, which is the correct remainder. If we forget to subtract ```1```, we will get ```10``` as the remainder, which is incorrect.
4. **Incorrect use of modulo operator**. The modulo operator ```%``` returns the remainder of division. For example, ```10 % 5``` returns ```0```, because ```10``` divided by ```5``` has no remainder. If the modulo operator is used incorrectly, the program will produce an incorrect output.
5. **Incorrect use of the exponentiation operator**. The exponentiation operator ```**``` raises a number to a power. For example, ```2**3``` equals ```8```, because ```2``` raised to the power of ```3``` is ```8```. If the exponentiation operator is used incorrectly, the program will produce an incorrect output.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

* Make sure that you understand the input format of the problem before you start coding.
* Carefully check your calculations to make sure that you are not making any mistakes.
* Be careful about off-by-one errors.
* Make sure that you are using the modulo operator and the exponentiation operator correctly.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

HACKEREARTH monk-and-match-making

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of comparison operators.** The problem statement asks you to compare two substrings and output "Yes" if they are equal, and "No" otherwise. However, if you accidentally use the wrong comparison operator, you may get the wrong answer. For example, if you compare two substrings using the `==` operator, you will get the wrong answer if the substrings are not equal.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When you are working with substrings, it is important to be careful about off-by-one errors. For example, if you are trying to compare the substrings "abc" and "abcd", you need to make sure that you are comparing the substrings from index 0 to index 2, and not from index 0 to index 3.
3. **Index out of bounds errors.** When you are working with substrings, it is important to make sure that the indices you are using are valid. For example, if you try to access the substring "abc" at index 4, you will get an index out of bounds error.
4. **Memory errors.** When you are working with large strings, it is important to be careful about memory usage. If you allocate too much memory, you may run out of memory and your program will crash.
5. **Time complexity.** The time complexity of your solution should be O(N), where N is the length of the input string. If your solution has a time complexity that is worse than O(N), it will be too slow for large inputs.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. **Use the correct comparison operators.** When comparing two substrings, use the `==` operator to check if they are equal, and the `!=` operator to check if they are not equal.
2. **Be careful about off-by-one errors.** When you are working with substrings, make sure that you are comparing the substrings from the correct indices.
3. **Check for index out of bounds errors.** Before you access a substring, make sure that the indices you are using are valid.
4. **Use efficient data structures.** When you are working with large strings, use efficient data structures to store them. This will help you to avoid memory errors.
5. **Optimize your code.** Make sure that your code is as efficient as possible. This will help you to reduce the running time of your solution.

HACKEREARTH string-sum

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of `ord()` function.** The `ord()` function returns the ASCII code of a character. For example, `ord('a')` returns 97. However, the problem statement asks for the weight of each character, not the ASCII code. To get the weight of a character, you can subtract 97 from its ASCII code.
2. **Incorrect use of `chr()` function.** The `chr()` function returns the character corresponding to a given ASCII code. For example, `chr(97)` returns the character 'a'. However, the problem statement does not ask for the character corresponding to the weight of each character. To get the character corresponding to a weight, you can add 97 to the weight.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the sum of weights.** The sum of weights of all characters in a string can be calculated using the following formula:

```
sum_of_weights = sum(ord(char) - 97 for char in string)
```

4. **Incorrect output format.** The output of the program should be a single integer, which is the sum of weights of all characters in the input string.

Here are some tips to avoid these problems:

1. Make sure you understand the problem statement carefully before you start coding.
2. Use the correct functions to get the ASCII code and character corresponding to a weight.

For example, the developer might forget to account for the fact that Utkarsh can only move in the positive x direction, or they might not correctly calculate the minimum number of jumps required to reach the destination.
2. **Incorrect input handling.** The developer may not correctly handle the input, which could lead to errors. For example, the developer might not check if the input is valid, or they might not correctly parse the input into the appropriate data structures.
3. **Incorrect output formatting.** The developer may not correctly format the output, which could make it difficult for the grader to understand the results. For example, the developer might not print the output in the correct format, or they might not include all of the required information.
4. **Insufficient testing.** The developer may not test their code sufficiently, which could lead to bugs that are not caught until it is too late. For example, the developer might not test their code on a variety of input values, or they might not test their code for edge cases.
5. **Failure to meet deadlines.** The developer may not meet the deadlines for the project, which could lead to problems such as missed deadlines or poor quality code. For example, the developer might not start working on the project early enough, or they might not have a good plan for how to complete the project on time.

ATCODER p02597 AtCoder Beginner Contest 174 - Alter Altar

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of swaps.** The problem states that you can swap two stones any number of times, but some developers may incorrectly count the number of swaps they make. For example, if the input is `WWRR`, a developer may incorrectly count two swaps, when in reality only one swap is needed.
2. **Not considering the order of the stones.** The problem states that you can swap two stones any number of times, but some developers may incorrectly assume that the order of the stones does not matter. For example, if the input is `WWRR`, a developer may incorrectly think that swapping the first two stones and the last two stones is the same as swapping the first and last stones.
3. **Misunderstanding the definition of a disaster.** The problem states that a white stone placed to the immediate left of a red stone will bring a disaster. However, some developers may incorrectly think that a white stone placed to the immediate right of a red stone will also bring a disaster.
4. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** The problem can be solved using a simple greedy algorithm, but some developers may try to use a more complex algorithm that is not necessary.
5. **Not handling corner cases correctly.** The problem has a few corner cases, such as when the input is empty or when all of the stones are the same color. Some developers may not handle these corner cases correctly, which can lead to incorrect results.

ATCODER p02728 AtCoder Beginner Contest 160 - Distributing Integers

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm.**

The tree traversal algorithm is a recursive algorithm that visits each vertex in a tree exactly once. It is a fundamental algorithm in computer science, and is used in a wide variety of applications. However, it is easy to make mistakes when implementing the algorithm, which can lead to incorrect results.

One common mistake is to forget to check if a vertex has already been visited. This can lead to a vertex being visited multiple times, which will result in an incorrect answer.

Another common mistake is to incorrectly calculate the next vertex to visit. This can lead to a vertex being skipped, which will also result in an incorrect answer.

**2. Incorrect use of the modulo operator.**

The modulo operator (%) is used to find the remainder of a division operation. It is often used to ensure that a number is within a certain range. However, it is important to use the modulo operator correctly, as incorrect usage can lead to incorrect results.

One common mistake is to use the modulo operator with a negative number. This will result in an incorrect answer.

Another common mistake is to use the modulo operator with a number that is too large. This can also result in an incorrect answer.

**3. Incorrect handling of overflow errors.**

Overflow errors occur when a calculation results in a number that is too large to be represented by the computer's data type. This can lead to incorrect results or even a program crash.

One common way to handle overflow errors is to use the `long long` data type. This data type can represent numbers that are much larger than the `int` data type, and is less likely to overflow.

Another way to handle overflow errors is to use the `unsigned` data type. This data type does not have a maximum value, so it cannot overflow.

**4. Incorrect use of the random number generator.**

The random number generator is a function that returns a random number within a specified range. It is often used to generate random numbers for games or simulations.

However, it is important to use the random number generator correctly, as incorrect usage can lead to incorrect results.

One common mistake is to use the random number generator too often. This can lead to the same number being generated multiple times, which can bias the results.

Another common mistake is to use the random number generator in a way that is not reproducible. This can make it difficult to debug problems or reproduce results.

**5. Incorrect use of the input/output functions.**

The input/output functions are used to read data from the keyboard or write data to the screen. They are a fundamental part of any program, and are essential for interacting with the user.

However, it is easy to make mistakes when using the input/output functions, which can lead to incorrect results or even a program crash.

One common mistake is to forget to check if the user has entered any data. This can lead to a program crash.

Another common mistake is to incorrectly format the data that is being read or written. This can lead to incorrect results.

**6. Incorrect use of the error handling functions.**

The error handling functions are used to handle errors that occur during the execution of a program. They are essential for ensuring that a program can continue to run even if an error occurs.

However, it is easy to make mistakes when using the error handling functions, which can lead to a program crash or incorrect results.

One common mistake is to ignore errors. This can lead to a program crash or incorrect results.

Another common mistake is to handle errors incorrectly. This can lead to a program crash or incorrect results.

Title:
ATCODER p02860 AtCoder Beginner Contest 145 - Echo

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input is a string of length N, so the developer should use a string data type to store it. However, if the developer uses an integer data type, they will get a runtime error.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The correct algorithm for this problem is to use a sliding window. The developer should iterate over the string S, keeping track of the longest substring that is a palindrome. If the length of the longest palindrome is equal to N, then the string is a concatenation of two copies of some string. Otherwise, the string is not a concatenation of two copies of some string.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The developer should be careful to check for the edge cases. For example, if the string S is empty, then it is not a concatenation of two copies of some string.

**4. Not handling errors correctly**

The developer should handle errors correctly. For example, if the input is not a valid integer, the developer should print an error message and exit the program.

**5. Not testing the code**

The developer should always test their code before submitting it. This will help to catch any bugs that may have been missed during development.
Test inputs:
1. ```
N = 6
S = 'abcabc'
```

2. ```
N = 6
S = 'abcadc'
```

3. ```
N = 1

Title:
ATCODER p02995 AtCoder Beginner Contest 131 - Anti-Division

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input constraints state that `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` are all integers. However, if you accidentally use a floating-point data type, you may get incorrect results. For example, if you use `float` for `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`, you may get the wrong answer for the following input:

```
A = 4.0
B = 9.0
C = 2.0
D = 3.0
```

The correct answer is 2, but you may get 3 instead because `float` arithmetic is not exact.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The naive algorithm for solving this problem is to iterate over all integers from `A` to `B`, and check each one to see if it is divisible by `C` or `D`. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(B - A), which is not efficient for large values of `B`.

A more efficient algorithm is to use the following formula:

```
count = (B - A) - (B // C) - (B // D) + (A // C) + (A // D)
```

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(1), which is much more efficient than the naive algorithm.

**3. Not handling special cases**

The input constraints state that `A` and `B` are both integers. However, it is possible for `A` to be less than 1 or for `B` to be greater than 10^18. If you do not handle these special cases, your code may crash or give incorrect results.

**4. Not using the correct data type**

The input constraints state that `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` are all integers. However, it is possible for one of these values to be very large. If you do not use a large enough data type, you may get incorrect results. For example, if you use `int` for `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`, you may get the wrong answer for the following input:

```
A = 10^18
B = 10^19
C = 10^18
D = 10^18
```

The correct answer is 0, but you may get 1 instead because `int` arithmetic is not exact.

**5. Not using the correct algorithm**

The input constraints state that `A` and `B` are both integers. However, it is possible for `A` to be equal to `B`. If you do not handle this special case, your code may crash or give incorrect results.

**6. Not handling overflow**

The input constraints state that `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` are all integers. However, it is possible for one of these values to be so large that it causes an overflow. If you do not handle overflow, your code may crash or give incorrect results.

Title:
ATCODER p03136 AtCoder Beginner Contest 117 - Polygon

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input is given in the form of integers, but the problem statement says that the sides of the polygon can have lengths up to 100. If we use a data type that is smaller than int, such as short or char, we may get incorrect results.

**2. Not using the theorem correctly**

The theorem states that an N-sided polygon can be drawn if and only if the longest side is strictly shorter than the sum of the lengths of the other N-1 sides. This means that we need to check if the longest side is less than the sum of the other sides, and if it is not, we need to print `No`.

**3. Not handling the case where the polygon is not convex**

The problem statement says that the polygon can be non-convex, but the theorem only applies to convex polygons. If we try to use the theorem to check if a non-convex polygon can be drawn, we will get incorrect results.

**4. Using an incorrect algorithm**

There are many different algorithms that can be used to check if a polygon can be drawn. The algorithm that we use should be efficient and should not have any bugs.

**5. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code thoroughly before submitting it. This will help to catch any bugs that may be present in the code.

1. **Incorrect input type**. The input is an integer, but the developer may accidentally treat it as a string. This would result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect range of input**. The input is an integer between 1 and 200, but the developer may accidentally allow inputs outside of this range. This would result in an incorrect answer or a runtime error.
3. **Incorrect calculation of divisors**. The number of divisors of an odd number is equal to the number of its prime factors plus 1. The developer may accidentally count the number of divisors incorrectly, resulting in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer, but the developer may accidentally output multiple integers or a non-integer value. This would result in a runtime error.
5. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem, such as logic errors, memory leaks, and race conditions. It is important to carefully test the code to ensure that it is correct and free of bugs.

Title:
ATCODER p03916 CODE FESTIVAL 2016 Final - Tokaido

Pain points:
* **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem is about a board game, and the developer may not be familiar with board games. They may make mistakes in understanding the rules of the game, or in implementing the game logic.
* **Incorrect implementation of the game logic.** The developer may make mistakes in implementing the game logic, such as incorrectly calculating the scores of the players or incorrectly determining the next moves of the players.
* **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The developer may not handle edge cases correctly, such as when the game ends in a tie, or when one of the players has no legal moves.
* **Incorrect time complexity.** The developer may implement the solution in a way that has a time complexity that is too high. This could lead to the solution being too slow to run on large inputs.
* **Incorrect space complexity.** The developer may implement the solution in a way that has a space complexity that is too high. This could lead to the solution running out of memory on large inputs.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer may incorrectly calculate the score of a player. For example, they may forget to include the value of the square that the player is currently occupying in their calculation.
* The developer may incorrectly determine the next move of a player. For example, they may not consider all of the possible moves that the player can make.
* The developer may not handle edge cases correctly. For example, they may not handle the case where the game ends in a tie, or the case where one of the players has no legal moves.
* The developer may implement the solution in a way that has a time complexity that is too high. For example, they may use a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem.
* The developer may implement the solution in a way that has a space complexity that is too high. For example, they may store all of the states of the game in memory.

Title:
AIZU p00150 Twin Prime

Pain points:
* **Incorrectly checking if a number is prime**. A common mistake is to check if a number is prime by simply checking if it is divisible by any number less than or equal to its square root. This is not sufficient, as there are many composite numbers that are not divisible by any number less than or equal to their square root. For example, 101 is not prime, but it is not divisible by any number less than or equal to its square root (10).
* **Not handling the case where the input is not a positive integer**. The input to this problem is a sequence of integers. If the input contains a non-integer value, the program will crash.
* **Not handling the case where the input is zero**. The input to this problem is a sequence of integers. If the input contains the value zero, the program should terminate.
* **Not handling the case where the input is greater than 10000**. The input to this problem is a sequence of integers. If the input contains a value greater than 10000, the program should terminate.
* **Not handling the case where the input contains two equal numbers**. The input to this problem is a sequence of integers. If the input contains two equal numbers, the program should print the smaller number.

AIZU p00663 SAT-EN-3

Pain points:
Here are the most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrect variable assignment**. When assigning values to variables, it is important to make sure that the values are correct. For example, if a variable is assigned the value "true" but the variable is actually false, the program will not work correctly.
2. **Incorrect use of logical operators**. The logical operators "and" (&&) and "or" (||) are often used incorrectly. For example, the expression "A && B" means that both A and B are true, while the expression "A || B" means that either A or B is true.
3. **Incorrect use of parentheses**. Parentheses are used to group expressions together. If parentheses are used incorrectly, the program will not work correctly.
4. **Undeclared variables**. If a variable is used in the program but is not declared, the program will not work correctly.
5. **Infinite loops**. If a program enters an infinite loop, it will never stop running. This can be caused by a bug in the program or by incorrect input data.
6. **Memory leaks**. A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. A security vulnerability is a weakness in a program that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system. Security vulnerabilities can be caused by a variety of factors, including incorrect code, insecure design, and poor implementation.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid common problems and bugs when solving SAT-EN-3 problems.

AIZU p00937 Sibling Rivalry

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be in the correct order. The developer should check the input format carefully and handle any errors gracefully.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of swaps.** The minimum number of swaps is the minimum number of times that two adjacent numbers need to be swapped in order to make the list sorted. The developer should be careful to calculate this number correctly.
3. **Incorrect output.** The output should be a single integer, which is the minimum number of swaps required. The developer should make sure that the output is correct.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over the list of numbers, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. The developer should be careful to check the indices of the numbers carefully.
5. **Memory leaks.** The developer should be careful to free up any memory that is allocated during the execution of the program.
6. **Race conditions.** If multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is possible for race conditions to occur. The developer should use locks or other synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions.

AIZU p01070 String in String

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrectly handling the input format.** The input format for this problem is specific, and it is important to make sure that you are correctly parsing the input data. For example, if you forget to account for the spaces between the values in the input, you will get incorrect results.
* **Using an inefficient algorithm.** The naive algorithm for solving this problem would be to iterate over all substrings of S that are of length equal to the length of Mi, and then check if each substring matches Mi. This algorithm would have a time complexity of O(N^2), where N is the length of S. However, there is a more efficient algorithm that uses a suffix array to find all occurrences of Mi in S in O(N log N) time.
* **Making a mistake in your code.** This is always a possibility, even for experienced developers. It is important to carefully check your code for errors before submitting it. Some common mistakes that developers make include: typos, incorrect variable declarations, and off-by-one errors.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly handling the input format.** For example, a developer might forget to account for the spaces between the values in the input, or they might incorrectly parse the values as integers. This would result in incorrect results.
* **Using an inefficient algorithm.** A developer might use the naive algorithm for solving this problem, which would have a time complexity of O(N^2). This would be much slower than the suffix array algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(N log N).
* **Making a mistake in your code.** A developer might make a mistake in their code, such as a typo, an incorrect variable declaration, or an off-by-one error. This would result in incorrect results.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* **Be careful when parsing the input data.** Make sure that you are correctly handling the spaces between the values in the input, and that you are correctly parsing the values as integers.
* **Use an efficient algorithm.** The suffix array algorithm is a much more efficient way to solve this problem than the naive algorithm.
* **Carefully check your code for errors.** Run your code through a compiler or debugger to check for typos, incorrect variable declarations, and off-by-one errors.

Title:
AIZU p01678 Restore Calculation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable types**. The problem statement specifies that the input should be a sequence of strings, but the code below incorrectly tries to parse the input as integers. This will cause the program to crash when it encounters a string that cannot be converted to an integer.
2. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic**. The problem statement specifies that the output should be modulo 1,000,000,007, but the code below does not perform any modulo arithmetic. This will cause the program to output incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. The code below incorrectly counts the number of possible assignments to the given problem. This is because it does not take into account the fact that the first digit of each number must not be zero.
4. **Incorrect use of recursion**. The code below uses recursion to solve the problem, but it does not handle the base case correctly. This will cause the program to enter an infinite loop when it encounters a problem that has no solution.
5. **Incorrect use of dynamic programming**. The code below attempts to use dynamic programming to solve the problem, but it does not correctly initialize the dynamic programming table. This will cause the program to output incorrect results.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully review the problem statement and make sure that your code is correct. You should also use a debugger to step through your code and verify that it is working correctly.

Title:
AIZU p02104 Chairs

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrectly handling the case where `pi` exceeds `N`.** In the problem statement, it is specified that if `pi` exceeds `N`, then `pi` should be set to 1. However, a developer may incorrectly set `pi` to `N + 1` instead. This would result in the person with ID `i` never being able to sit down.
* **Incorrectly handling the case where multiple people want to sit in the same chair.** In the problem statement, it is specified that if two or more people want to sit in the same chair, then the person with the smaller ID should sit in the chair. However, a developer may incorrectly allow the person with the larger ID to sit in the chair. This would result in the person with the smaller ID not being able to sit down.
* **Incorrectly handling the case where the chairs are not arranged in a row.** In the problem statement, it is specified that the people are lined up in a row in ascending order of ID. However, a developer may incorrectly assume that the chairs are also arranged in a row. This would result in the people not being able to sit down in the correct order.
* **Incorrectly handling the case where the input is invalid.** The input to the problem may be invalid, such as if it contains a negative number or a number that is greater than `N`. A developer must be careful to check the input for validity and handle invalid input appropriately.

**Additional tips for solving this problem:**

* To avoid the problem of incorrectly handling the case where `pi` exceeds `N`, you can use the following code:

```
if pi > N:
    pi = 1
```

* To avoid the problem of incorrectly handling the case where multiple people want to sit in the same chair, you can use the following code:

```
if pi == p[i]:
    p[i] += 1
    if p[i] > N:
        p[i] = 1
```

* To avoid the problem of incorrectly handling the case where the chairs are not arranged in a row, you can use the following code:

```
for i in range(N):
    p[i] = i + 1
```

* To avoid the problem of incorrectly handling the case where the input is invalid, you can use the following code:

```
if N < 1 or N > 105:
    print('Invalid input')
    exit(0)
```

Title:
AIZU p02390 Watch

Pain points:
**1. Integer overflow**

The input $S$ can be as large as 86400, which is larger than the maximum value of an integer. To avoid integer overflow, we can use a long long type to store $S$.

**2. Division by zero**

When $S$ is 0, the expression `S / 3600` will cause a division by zero error. To avoid this error, we can check if $S$ is 0 before dividing it by 3600.

**3. Incorrect calculation of hours, minutes, and seconds**

The formula for calculating hours, minutes, and seconds from $S$ is:

```
h = S // 3600
m = (S % 3600) // 60
s = (S % 3600) % 60
```

However, this formula is incorrect when $S$ is less than 60. To correct this, we can add 60 to $S$ before dividing it by 3600.

**4. Incorrect formatting of the output**

The output should be in the format `h:m:s`. To ensure that the output is formatted correctly, we can use the following code:

```
printf("%02d:%02d:%02d", h, m, s);
```

This code will pad the hours, minutes, and seconds with zeros to make sure that they are always two digits long.
