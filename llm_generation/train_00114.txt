CODECHEF cdva1604

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect logic:** The logic to find the survivor may be incorrect. For example, the logic may be to find the last element in the list and return it as the survivor. However, this logic would not work if the list is empty.
2. **Incorrect data type:** The data type of the input may be incorrect. For example, the input may be a string instead of an integer. This would cause the program to crash.
3. **Off-by-one error:** The program may calculate the survivor incorrectly by forgetting to account for the first element in the list. For example, the program may calculate the survivor as the second-to-last element in the list instead of the last element.
4. **Infinite loop:** The program may enter an infinite loop if it does not have a way to terminate. For example, the program may continuously try to find the survivor in a list that is empty.
5. **Memory leak:** The program may leak memory if it does not properly free the memory that it allocates. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
6. **Security vulnerability:** The program may contain a security vulnerability if it allows the user to input arbitrary data. This could allow the user to execute arbitrary code on the system.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design the program and test it thoroughly.

Title:
CODECHEF mulmagic

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem statement mentions that the array is of size `N` (1-based indexing). However, the code uses a 0-based array. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect use of mathematical operators.** The problem statement mentions that the numbers in the array are positive. However, the code uses the `%` operator to calculate the remainder, which can lead to negative results.
3. **Incorrect use of control flow statements.** The problem statement mentions that the game ends when it is no longer possible to choose a number. However, the code does not check for this condition, which can lead to an infinite loop.
4. **Incorrect use of functions.** The problem statement mentions that the player can choose any number (except the first number). However, the code does not check for this condition, which can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect use of error handling.** The problem statement does not mention any errors that can occur. However, the code does not handle any errors, which can lead to unexpected results.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the constraints. It is also important to use the correct data structures and mathematical operators. Finally, it is important to use the correct control flow statements and functions. By following these guidelines, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving programming problems.

CODEFORCES 1254_B1. Send Boxes to Alice (Easy Version)

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**

The input format of the problem is "The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of chocolate boxes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) — the number of chocolate pieces in the i-th box.

It is guaranteed that at least one of a_1, a_2, …, a_n is positive.".

But a developer may write the following code:

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

This code will fail because the input format is not correct.

**2. The output format is not correct**

The output format of the problem is "If there is no way for Charlie to make Alice happy, print -1.

Otherwise, print a single integer x — the minimum number of seconds for Charlie to help Bob make Alice happy.".

But a developer may write the following code:

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

if sum(a) % 2 == 0:
    print(0)
else:
    print(1)
```

This code will fail because the output format is not correct.

**3. The developer may not understand the problem correctly**

The problem states that "Alice dislikes coprime sets, she will be happy only if there exists some integer k > 1 such that the number of pieces in each box is divisible by k".

But a developer may misunderstand the problem and think that "Alice dislikes coprime sets, she will be happy only if there exists some integer k > 1 such that the number of pieces in each box is equal to k".

This misunderstanding will lead to a wrong solution.

CODEFORCES 1297_G. M-numbers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a single line of two integers, m and k, separated by a space. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer, the k-th m-number in ascending order. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly output the answer and will likely crash.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the k-th m-number.** The k-th m-number is the smallest m-number that is greater than or equal to k. To calculate this number, you can use a binary search. However, if the binary search is not implemented correctly, the program may not be able to find the k-th m-number and will likely output an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The product of the digits of an m-number can be very large, so it is important to handle overflow correctly. If overflow is not handled correctly, the program may crash or output an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect handling of invalid inputs.** The input may contain invalid values, such as m < 2 or k < 1. If the program does not handle these invalid inputs correctly, it may crash or output an incorrect answer.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to implement the binary search and overflow handling correctly. Finally, it is important to test the program with a variety of inputs to ensure that it is working correctly.

CODEFORCES 1362_A. Johnny and Ancient Computer

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input and output data is given as integers. However, if the values are very large, they may overflow the integer data type. To avoid this, you can use the `long` data type.

**2. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^{18}`. However, your code may not handle these edge cases correctly. For example, if `a = 10^{18}` and `b = 10^{19}`, your code may divide `a` by `2` and return `5` as the answer, even though this is not a valid operation.

**3. Using incorrect algorithms**

The problem can be solved using a simple greedy algorithm. However, your code may use a more complex algorithm that is not necessary. This can lead to unnecessary runtime and memory usage.

**4. Not using efficient data structures**

The problem can be solved using a simple array or hashmap. However, your code may use a more complex data structure that is not necessary. This can lead to unnecessary runtime and memory usage.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it to the judge. This will help you catch any bugs that you may have missed. You can test your code using a variety of online tools, such as [Codeforces's Testlib](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1063/A) or [LeetCode's Testcases](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/).

CODEFORCES 1382_C1. Prefix Flip (Easy Version)

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly and in the correct format. For example, if you are expecting a single integer but you receive a string, you will need to handle this accordingly.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also very specific. It is important to make sure that you are outputting the correct information in the correct format. For example, if you are expected to output a list of integers but you output a string, you will receive a incorrect answer.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

This problem is very prone to off-by-one errors. It is important to make sure that you are counting everything correctly and that you are not missing any elements. For example, if you are supposed to flip the first 5 bits of a string but you only flip the first 4 bits, you will get an incorrect answer.

**4. Incorrect logic**

The logic for this problem is not very complicated, but it is important to make sure that you are thinking carefully about the problem and that you are not making any mistakes. For example, if you are trying to flip a prefix of a string but you are not reversing the order of the bits, you will get an incorrect answer.

**5. Runtime errors**

This problem is not very computationally intensive, but it is still possible to make runtime errors. For example, if you are using an inefficient algorithm, you may run out of time on the test cases.

**6. Memory errors**

This problem does not require a lot of memory, but it is still possible to run into memory errors. For example, if you are creating a very large data structure, you may run out of memory on the test cases.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1402_C. Star Trek

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modular arithmetic**.

When calculating the number of possible placements of portals, it is important to use modular arithmetic correctly. For example, if you are calculating the number of ways to choose $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements, you need to use the following formula:

```
\binom{n}{k} \equiv \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \mod (10^9+7)
```

**2. Off-by-one errors**.

When counting the number of possible placements of portals, it is important to make sure that you are not counting the same placement multiple times. For example, if you are considering all possible ways to place two portals, you need to make sure that you don't count the placement where the first portal is placed on planet $A$ and the second portal is placed on planet $B$ as the same as the placement where the first portal is placed on planet $B$ and the second portal is placed on planet $A$.

**3. Incorrect use of data structures**.

When solving this problem, it is important to use the correct data structures to store the information about the space tunnels and the portals. For example, if you are storing the information about the space tunnels in an adjacency list, you need to make sure that you are not creating duplicate edges.

**4. Incorrect use of algorithms**.

When solving this problem, it is important to use the correct algorithms to solve the problem. For example, if you are trying to find the shortest path between two vertices in a graph, you need to use the Dijkstra algorithm or the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

**5. Incorrect implementation**.

When implementing your solution, it is important to make sure that you are not making any mistakes in your code. For example, if you are using a for loop to iterate over a list, you need to make sure that you are not using the wrong index.

**6. Incorrect test cases**.

When testing your solution, it is important to make sure that you are testing your solution on a variety of different input cases. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed in your implementation.

**7. Incorrect debugging**.

When debugging your solution, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct debugging tools. For example, if you are using a debugger, you need to make sure that you are setting breakpoints in the correct places.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1498_A. GCD Sum

Pain points:
### 1. **Incorrect implementation of the gcdSum function**

The gcdSum function should return the greatest common divisor of the given integer and the sum of its digits. A common mistake is to return the gcd of the given integer and each digit of the integer separately. This will not give the correct answer, as the gcd of two numbers is not necessarily the same as the gcd of each number with itself.

For example, if the given integer is 1234, and the sum of its digits is 10, then the correct answer is 3, as 1234 and 10 are both divisible by 3. However, if the gcdSum function is implemented incorrectly, it will return 1, as 1234 and 1 are both divisible by 1.

### 2. **Using an incorrect algorithm to find the smallest integer greater than or equal to n whose gcdSum is greater than 1**

The simplest way to find the smallest integer greater than or equal to n whose gcdSum is greater than 1 is to increment n until the gcdSum of n is greater than 1. However, this algorithm is inefficient, as it may require a large number of iterations.

A more efficient algorithm is to use the following formula:

```
next = n + (n % gcdSum(n))
```

This formula will find the smallest integer greater than or equal to n whose gcdSum is greater than 1.

### 3. **Not handling negative integers correctly**

The gcdSum function should only be used on positive integers. If a negative integer is passed to the function, it will return an incorrect result.

### 4. **Not handling input errors correctly**

The input should be validated to ensure that it is a valid integer. If the input is not a valid integer, the program should exit with an error message.

### 5. **Not handling infinite loops correctly**

The program should be designed to avoid infinite loops. If the program enters an infinite loop, it will never terminate and will eventually crash.

### 6. **Not using appropriate data types**

The program should use the appropriate data types to store the input and output data. Using the wrong data types can lead to errors.

### 7. **Not testing the program thoroughly**

The program should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it is working correctly. This includes testing for all possible input values and error conditions.

### 8. **Not documenting the program correctly**

The program should be well-documented so that other developers can understand how it works. This includes documenting the purpose of the program, the input and output data, and the algorithms used.

Test inputs:

Title:
CODEFORCES 175_B. Plane of Tanks: Pro

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type.** The input data is a list of strings, but the code tries to convert it to a list of integers. This will cause an error.
2. **Off-by-one error.** The code iterates over the list of players twice, once to find the maximum score and once to assign categories. This will cause the last player to be assigned the wrong category.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The code checks if a player's score is better than the median score, but this is not the correct way to determine a player's category. The correct way is to check if a player's score is better than the score of the player in the 50th percentile.
4. **Uninitialized variable.** The code uses a variable called `best_score` without initializing it. This will cause the variable to be assigned a random value, which could lead to incorrect results.
5. **Unused variable.** The code defines a variable called `n` but never uses it. This is a waste of memory and can lead to errors.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully check your code for errors before submitting it. You should also use a debugger to help you track down any problems that you find.

CODEFORCES 268_C. Beautiful Sets of Points

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be two space-separated integers n and m. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the distance between two points**. The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2). If the distance is an integer, the two points are not beautiful.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer k, followed by k lines of two space-separated integers, the x- and y-coordinates of a point from the set. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be accepted by the judge.
4. **Incorrect solution**. The solution should be a set of points that satisfies the two conditions in the problem statement. If the solution is not correct, the program will not be accepted by the judge.
5. **Time complexity**. The time complexity of the program should be O(n + m). If the time complexity is too high, the program will time out on the judge.
6. **Space complexity**. The space complexity of the program should be O(n + m). If the space complexity is too high, the program will run out of memory on the judge.

CODEFORCES 290_F. Greedy Petya

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect graph representation**. The graph is represented as a list of edges, where each edge is a tuple of two integers representing the vertices that the edge connects. However, the graph may not be connected, or it may contain multiple edges between the same two vertices.
2. **Incorrect traversal algorithm**. The traversal algorithm used to find a Hamiltonian path may not be correct. For example, it may not visit all of the vertices in the graph, or it may visit the same vertex multiple times.
3. **Incorrect termination condition**. The traversal algorithm may not terminate correctly. For example, it may continue to traverse the graph even after finding a Hamiltonian path, or it may terminate before finding a Hamiltonian path even if one exists.
4. **Incorrect output**. The output of the program may not be correct. For example, it may print "Yes" even if there is no Hamiltonian path in the graph, or it may print "No" even if there is a Hamiltonian path in the graph.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

1. Make sure that the graph is represented correctly. Use a data structure that can represent a directed or undirected graph, and make sure that all of the edges are represented correctly.
2. Use a correct traversal algorithm. There are many different algorithms that can be used to find a Hamiltonian path in a graph. Choose an algorithm that is well-suited for the type of graph that you are working with.
3. Make sure that the traversal algorithm terminates correctly. Use a termination condition that will ensure that the algorithm will stop after finding a Hamiltonian path, or after determining that no Hamiltonian path exists.
4. Make sure that the output of the program is correct. Use a test suite to verify that the program is correctly identifying Hamiltonian paths in graphs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 478_C. Table Decorations

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type to store the input values**

The input values are integers, so they should be stored in an integer data type. If they are stored in a floating-point data type, the calculations will be inaccurate and the wrong answer will be returned.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem can be solved using the greedy algorithm. The greedy algorithm works by choosing the best option at each step. In this problem, the best option is to choose the color with the fewest balloons and subtract 1 from it. This will ensure that the number of tables that can be decorated is maximized.

**3. Making a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm**

The algorithm is simple to implement, but it is easy to make a mistake. One common mistake is to forget to subtract 1 from the number of balloons in each color after choosing the best option. This will result in the wrong answer being returned.

**4. Not handling the corner cases correctly**

The corner cases are the cases where the input values are 0, 1, or 2. These cases are easy to miss, but they are important to handle correctly. If they are not handled correctly, the wrong answer will be returned.

**5. Not testing the code thoroughly**

It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. This can be done by creating a set of test cases and running the code on them. The test cases should cover all of the possible input values and corner cases. If the code passes all of the test cases, it is likely to be correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 551_D. GukiZ and Binary Operations

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**. The input format should be ```
n,k,l,m
```
where `n` is the length of the array, `k` is the maximum value of an element in the array, `l` is the maximum bit length of an element in the array, and `m` is the modulo.

**2. The output format is not correct**. The output format should be ```
ans
```
where `ans` is the number of arrays satisfying the condition modulo `m`.

**3. The code does not correctly calculate the number of arrays satisfying the condition**. There are a few possible reasons for this:

    * The code may not be correct.
    * The code may be correct, but it may be too slow.
    * The code may be correct and fast, but it may not be using the most efficient algorithm.

**4. The code does not correctly handle the modulo operation**. The modulo operation is a mathematical operation that takes two numbers and returns the remainder of the first number divided by the second number. In this problem, the modulo operation is used to ensure that the answer is a number between 0 and `m` inclusive.

**5. The code does not correctly handle the overflow of integers**. When integers are added, subtracted, or multiplied, they can sometimes overflow and produce a number that is too large to represent. In this problem, the integers `n`, `k`, `l`, and `m` are all positive, so they cannot overflow. However, the number of arrays satisfying the condition can be very large, so it is possible for the answer to overflow.

**6. The code does not correctly handle the edge cases**. There are a few edge cases that the code must be able to handle correctly. For example, the code must be able to handle the case where `n` is 1, the case where `k` is 0, and the case where `l` is 0.

**7. The code does not correctly handle the input data**. The code must be able to handle all of the input data correctly. For example, the code must be able to handle the case where the input data is invalid.

CODEFORCES 578_E. Walking!

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the input should be a string of length 1 to 100,000. However, if the input string is longer than 100,000 characters, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the first line should contain a number, and the second line should contain a permutation of integers. However, if the first line contains anything other than a number, or if the second line does not contain a permutation of integers, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The program should calculate the minimum number of backward steps and output a permutation of integers that represents a possible history of the footprints. However, if the program's logic is incorrect, it may output an incorrect answer.
4. **Memory leaks.** The program should not allocate any memory that it does not need. However, if the program allocates memory that it does not need, it may eventually run out of memory and crash.
5. **Synchronization issues.** The program should be thread-safe. However, if the program is not thread-safe, it may produce incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.
6. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program should not be vulnerable to any security attacks. However, if the program is vulnerable to a security attack, it may allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design and implement the program. The program should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and does not have any bugs.

CODEFORCES 691_F. Couple Cover

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format specified in the problem statement is very strict. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to process the input correctly and will likely crash. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program will likely crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format specified in the problem statement is also very strict. If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will likely receive a incorrect verdict. For example, if the output contains a number that is not an integer, the program will likely receive a incorrect verdict.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve the problem must be correct in order for the program to produce the correct output. If the algorithm is incorrect, the program will likely produce incorrect output. For example, if the algorithm does not take into account all of the constraints specified in the problem statement, the program will likely produce incorrect output.

**4. Incorrect data structures**

The data structures used to store the input data and the output data must be correct in order for the program to run efficiently and produce the correct output. If the data structures are incorrect, the program will likely run inefficiently and/or produce incorrect output. For example, if the data structures are not able to store the input data and the output data correctly, the program will likely run inefficiently and/or produce incorrect output.

**5. Incorrect memory management**

The program must manage its memory correctly in order to run efficiently and produce the correct output. If the program does not manage its memory correctly, the program will likely run inefficiently and/or produce incorrect output. For example, if the program allocates too much memory or does not free up memory when it is no longer needed, the program will likely run inefficiently and/or produce incorrect output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 717_A. Festival Organization

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined. For example, the input `1 1 2` is valid, but the input `1,1,2` is not. The developer should make sure that the input is in the correct format.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not strictly defined. For example, the output `5` is valid, but the output `0000000005` is not. The developer should make sure that the output is in the correct format.

**3. Incorrect calculation**

The developer may make a mistake in the calculation. For example, the developer may forget to take into account the fact that the number of ways to select k different tours of the same length is a decreasing function of k. The developer should carefully check the calculation to make sure that it is correct.

**4. Incorrect modulo operation**

The developer may make a mistake in the modulo operation. For example, the developer may forget to add 1 to the result before performing the modulo operation. The developer should carefully check the modulo operation to make sure that it is correct.

**5. Incorrect use of the 109 + 7 (1e9 + 7) constant**

The developer may use the 109 + 7 (1e9 + 7) constant incorrectly. For example, the developer may use the constant as a modulus when it should be used as an exponent. The developer should carefully check the use of the 109 + 7 (1e9 + 7) constant to make sure that it is correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 737_C. Subordinates

Pain points:

In the second example it is possible that only the second and third workers made a mistake. Then: 

  * the immediate superior of the second worker is the first worker, 
  * the immediate superior of the third worker is the first worker, 
  * the first worker is the chief.  1. **Incorrect use of input/output.** The problem statement specifies that the input should be two integers, `n` and `s`, followed by a list of `n` integers. However, the following code would fail to read the input correctly:

```python
n, s = input().split()
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

The correct way to read the input is as follows:

```python
n, s = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

2. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem statement specifies that the workers are numbered from 1 to `n`. However, the following code would incorrectly assume that the workers are numbered from 0 to `n - 1`:

```python
graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
for i in range(n - 1):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    graph[a - 1].append(b - 1)
```

The correct way to create the graph is as follows:

```python
graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
for i in range(n - 1):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    graph[a].append(b)
```

3. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** The problem statement states that each worker except the chief has exactly one immediate superior. However, the following code would incorrectly assume that each worker has exactly one superior:

```python
def dfs(node):
    visited[node] = True
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            dfs(neighbor)

visited = [False] * n
dfs(s)

print(sum(visited))
```

The correct way to solve the problem is as follows:

```python
def dfs(node):
    visited[node] = True
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            dfs(neighbor)

visited = [False] * n
dfs(s)

mistakes = 0
for i in range(n):
    if visited[i] and a[i] != n - 1:
        mistakes += 1

print(mistakes)
```

4. **Incorrect error handling.** The problem statement states that the input should be two integers, `n` and `s`, followed by a list of `n` integers. However, the following code would not handle the case where the input is invalid:

```python
try:
    n, s = input().split()
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
except ValueError:
    print('Invalid input')
```

The correct way to handle the case where the input is invalid is as follows:

```python
try:
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
except ValueError:
    print('Invalid input')
else:

CODEFORCES 761_B. Dasha and friends

Pain points:
**1. Input format error**

The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the first line may contain more than two integers, or the second line may contain less than n integers.

**2. Output format error**

The output format is not strictly followed. For example, the output may contain more than one word, or the output may not be all uppercase.

**3. Incorrect calculation**

The program may calculate the answer incorrectly. For example, the program may not consider the fact that the barriers are located at integer distance from each other along the track.

**4. Runtime error**

The program may run out of time or memory. For example, the program may use a recursive function to solve the problem, and the recursion depth may be too large.

**5. Logical error**

The program may have a logical error. For example, the program may assume that the barriers are located at the same positions on all tracks, even though this is not necessarily true.
Test inputs:
1. Incorrect calculation

Title:
CODEFORCES 830_C. Bamboo Partition

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect calculation of the maximum value of d.** The maximum value of d is the smallest integer such that the total length of bamboo parts that Vladimir will cut off is less than or equal to k. To calculate this value, we can iterate over all possible values of d and for each value, calculate the total length of bamboo parts that Vladimir will cut off. The smallest value of d for which this total length is less than or equal to k is the maximum value of d.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the total length of bamboo parts that Vladimir will cut off.** To calculate the total length of bamboo parts that Vladimir will cut off, we need to add the lengths of all the bamboo parts that he will cut off. The length of a bamboo part is the difference between the required height of the bamboo and the height of the bamboo at the time it is cut. We need to be careful when calculating the height of the bamboo at the time it is cut, because the bamboo grows 1 meter each day.

**3. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for finding the maximum value of d is simple, but it is important to implement it correctly. One common mistake is to forget to check that the total length of bamboo parts that Vladimir will cut off is less than or equal to k. Another common mistake is to iterate over all possible values of d, even though we only need to iterate over the smallest values of d.

**4. Incorrect input.** The input for this problem is a list of integers. It is important to make sure that the input is correctly formatted and that all of the integers are valid. One common mistake is to forget to add a newline character to the end of the input. Another common mistake is to enter an integer that is too large or too small.

**5. Incorrect output.** The output for this problem is a single integer. It is important to make sure that the output is correctly formatted and that the integer is valid. One common mistake is to forget to add a newline character to the end of the output. Another common mistake is to output an integer that is too large or too small.

CODEFORCES 875_F. Royal Questions

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is specified in the problem statement. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to parse the input and will produce an error.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also specified in the problem statement. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be accepted by the judge.

**3. Overflow**

The problem statement states that the number of princes and princesses can be up to 200,000. If the program does not handle this case correctly, it may overflow and produce incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect data structures**

The problem statement does not specify the data structures that should be used to solve the problem. If the program uses incorrect data structures, it may not be able to solve the problem efficiently or correctly.

**5. Incorrect algorithms**

The problem statement does not specify the algorithms that should be used to solve the problem. If the program uses incorrect algorithms, it may not be able to solve the problem efficiently or correctly.

**6. Incorrect implementation**

Even if the program uses the correct data structures and algorithms, it may still be incorrect if it is not implemented correctly. For example, the program may have bugs in the code that cause it to produce incorrect results.

**7. Incorrect testing**

The program should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. If the program is not tested correctly, it may contain bugs that will not be found until it is submitted to the judge.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be a single integer n, followed by a line of n integers. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a string of characters "L", "R", and "A". If the output format is incorrect, the program will not produce the correct answer.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of ice blocks**. The program should calculate the number of ice blocks that need to be created in order to destroy all of the fire demons. If the number of ice blocks is incorrect, the program will not produce the correct answer.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the order in which to create the ice blocks**. The program should create the ice blocks in a way that minimizes the total time required to destroy all of the fire demons. If the order in which the ice blocks are created is incorrect, the program will not produce the correct answer.
5. **Incorrect calculation of the number of times to move Solomon**. The program should move Solomon the minimum number of times necessary to destroy all of the fire demons. If Solomon moves more times than necessary, the program will not produce the correct answer.
6. **Incorrect calculation of the order in which to move Solomon**. The program should move Solomon in a way that minimizes the total time required to destroy all of the fire demons. If the order in which Solomon moves is incorrect, the program will not produce the correct answer.

Title:
CODEFORCES 920_G. List Of Integers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line contains one integer t, which is the number of queries. The next t lines each contain three integers x, p, and k, which are the values for the x, p, and k parameters of the queries. If the input format is not followed, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the program should print t integers, where the i-th integer is the answer to the i-th query. If the output format is not followed, the program will not be able to correctly output the results and will likely receive a negative score.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the answers.** The answers to the queries are the k-th elements of the sequence L(x, p). To calculate these elements, the program must first find the smallest integer y such that gcd(p, y) = 1 and y > x. Once this integer is found, the program can simply add k - 1 to it to find the k-th element of the sequence. If the calculation of the answers is incorrect, the program will likely produce incorrect results.
4. **Memory leaks.** The program must be careful not to allocate too much memory, as this can lead to the program crashing or running out of memory. To avoid memory leaks, the program should only allocate memory that it needs and should free any memory that it no longer needs.
5. **Synchronization issues.** If the program is multi-threaded, it must be careful to ensure that threads do not access shared data simultaneously. This can be done by using locks or other synchronization mechanisms. If synchronization issues are not handled correctly, the program may produce incorrect results or crash.
Test inputs:
**Incorrect input format**

```
1
7 22 1
```

This input is incorrect because it does not follow the specified input format. The first line should contain one integer t, which is the number of queries. The second line should contain three integers x, p, and k, which are the values for the x, p, and k parameters of the queries.

**Incorrect output format**

```
1
2
3
```

This output is incorrect because it does not follow the specified output format. The program should print t integers, where the i-th integer is the answer to the i-th query.

**Incorrect calculation of the answers**

```
1
7 22 1
```

This input is correct, but the program will incorrectly calculate the answer. The correct answer is 9, but the program will output 1. This is because the program does not correctly find the smallest integer y such that gcd(p, y) = 1 and y > x.

**Memory leaks**

```
1000000
1000000 1000000 1
```

This input will cause the program to allocate a large amount of memory, which could lead to the program crashing or running out of memory.

**Synchronization issues**

```
1
1 2 3
```

This input will cause the program to have synchronization issues if it is multi-threaded. This is because the program will be accessing the shared variable k simultaneously from multiple threads.

Here are some additional program inputs that you can use to test your implementation:

* Input that contains negative integers
* Input that contains non-integer values
* Input that contains duplicate values
* Input that contains values that are out of range
* Input that contains invalid values
* Input that is not formatted correctly
Title:
CODEFORCES 949_E. Binary Cards

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not strictly defined. For example, the input `1
9` is valid, but the input `1
9 10` is not. The developer should check the input format and raise an error if it is incorrect.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is also not strictly defined. For example, the output `2
1 8` is valid, but the output `2
1 8 9` is not. The developer should check the output format and raise an error if it is incorrect.

**3. Incorrect solution**

The developer may come up with a solution that does not work for all test cases. For example, the following solution is incorrect:

```
def solve():
    # Get the number of rounds.
    n = int(input())

    # Get the list of numbers that the jury will tell in each round.
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Initialize the deck.
    deck = []

    # Iterate over the rounds.
    for i in range(n):
        # Add the card that matches the number that the jury told in this round to the deck.
        deck.append(a[i])

    # Print the number of cards in the deck.
    print(len(deck))

    # Print the ranks of the cards in the deck.
    print(*deck)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```

This solution will not work for the test case `1
9` because it will try to add the card `9` to the deck, which is not a power of two.

**4. Runtime error**

The developer may write a solution that runs in time that is too long for the problem. For example, the following solution is incorrect:

```
def solve():
    # Get the number of rounds.
    n = int(input())

    # Get the list of numbers that the jury will tell in each round.
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Initialize the deck.
    deck = []

    # Iterate over the rounds.
    for i in range(n):
        # Add all of the cards that match the number that the jury told in this round to the deck.
        for j in range(2**31):
            if a[i] == j:
                deck.append(j)

    # Print the number of cards in the deck.
    print(len(deck))

    # Print the ranks of the cards in the deck.
    print(*deck)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```

This solution will run in time that is exponential in the number of rounds, which is too long for the problem.

**5. Memory error**

The developer may write a solution that uses too much memory. For example, the following solution is incorrect:

```
def solve():
    # Get the number of rounds.
    n = int(input())

    # Get the list of numbers that the jury will tell in each round.
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Initialize the deck.
    deck = []

    # Iterate over the rounds.
    for i in range(n):
        # Add all of the cards that match the number that the jury told in this round to the deck.
        for j in range(2**31):
            if a[i] == j:
                deck.append(j)

    # Print the number of cards in the deck.
    print(len(deck))

    # Print the ranks of the cards in the deck.
    print(*deck)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```

This solution will use up all of the memory on the computer because it will create a list of all of the powers of two.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format specifies that the only line of the input file contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). If the input does not match this format, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format specifies that the output should be a single integer. If the output is not a single integer, the program will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the number of distinct integers**

```
C(n + 3, 4) - C(n + 2, 3) - C(n + 1, 2) + C(n, 1)
```

where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient. If the program calculates this number incorrectly, it will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.

**4. Runtime error**

The program may run out of time if it is too slow. This can happen if the program uses an inefficient algorithm or if it uses too much memory.

**5. Memory error**

The program may run out of memory if it allocates too much memory. This can happen if the program uses an inefficient algorithm or if it uses too much data.

Title:
HACKEREARTH battle-of-words

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly comparing strings.** The problem statement specifies that the strings can have multiple words, but the solution code compares them as if they were single words. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Not handling all possible cases.** The problem statement specifies that the strings can contain any alphabet from 'a' to 'z', but the solution code only handles lowercase letters. This can lead to incorrect results if the strings contain uppercase letters.
3. **Using incorrect data types.** The problem statement specifies that the strings can have a maximum length of 10^5, but the solution code uses string variables, which can only have a maximum length of 2^31-1 characters. This can lead to incorrect results if the strings are longer than 2^31-1 characters.
4. **Using inefficient algorithms.** The solution code uses a brute-force algorithm to compare the strings, which can be very inefficient for large strings. This can lead to long running times.
5. **Not handling errors correctly.** The solution code does not handle errors correctly. This can lead to unexpected results if there are any errors in the input data.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand all of the constraints. It is also important to use the correct data types and algorithms. Finally, it is important to handle errors correctly.

Title:
HACKEREARTH exam-time-2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of modulo operator**. The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 5 % 2 returns 1 because 5 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. However, if you try to use the modulo operator to check if two numbers are relatively prime, you will get incorrect results. For example, 5 % 3 returns 2, which means that 5 and 3 are not relatively prime.
2. **Incorrect use of the Euclidean algorithm**. The Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both numbers evenly. For example, the GCD of 10 and 15 is 5. However, if you try to use the Euclidean algorithm to find the number of positive numbers between 1 and n that are relatively prime to n, you will get incorrect results. For example, the number of positive numbers between 1 and 10 that are relatively prime to 10 is 6, not 5.
3. **Incorrect use of the Sieve of Eratosthenes**. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a method for finding all prime numbers up to a given number. The Sieve of Eratosthenes works by first creating a list of all the numbers from 2 to n. Then, it iteratively marks each multiple of a prime number as not prime. For example, if you start with the list of numbers from 2 to 10, the Sieve of Eratosthenes will mark the numbers 2, 3, 5, and 7 as prime, and it will mark the numbers 4, 6, 8, and 10 as not prime.
4. **Incorrect use of the prime factorization theorem**. The prime factorization theorem states that every positive integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of prime numbers. For example, 10 can be expressed as 2 * 5. However, if you try to use the prime factorization theorem to find the number of positive numbers between 1 and n that are relatively prime to n, you will get incorrect results. For example, the number of positive numbers between 1 and 10 that are relatively prime to 10 is 6, not 5.

To avoid these problems, it is important to understand the mathematical concepts behind the algorithms that you are using. It is also important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is working correctly.

Title:
HACKEREARTH the-door-closing-game-5

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the game rules**

The game rules are not clearly defined in the problem statement. For example, it is not clear whether Alice and Bob can close the same door in the same turn. If they can, then the game is not well-defined, because it is possible for both players to close all the doors in the same turn, which would result in a tie.

Title:
HACKEREARTH xsquare-and-balanced-strings

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input string is a string of lowercase alphabets. However, if we declare the variable `S` as a `char` array, we will not be able to store the characters of the string. This will result in a `Segmentation fault`.

To avoid this, we can declare `S` as a `string` variable.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the minimum number of substrings in which the given string can be broken so that each substring is a balanced string. A balanced string is a string whose characters can be partitioned into two multisets such that M1 = M2.

One way to solve this problem is to use the following algorithm:

1. Iterate over the string `S` from left to right.
2. For each character `c` in the string, create a new multiset `M`.
3. Add `c` to `M`.
4. If `M` is balanced, then break the string `S` into two substrings at the position of `c`.
5. Otherwise, continue iterating over the string `S`.

This algorithm will work, but it is not very efficient. A more efficient algorithm is to use the following approach:

1. Iterate over the string `S` from left to right.
2. For each character `c` in the string, create a new multiset `M`.
3. Add `c` to `M`.
4. If `M` is balanced, then continue iterating over the string `S`.
5. Otherwise, find the longest substring of `S` that is balanced.
6. Break the string `S` into two substrings at the position of the longest balanced substring.

This algorithm is more efficient because it does not need to create a new multiset for each character in the string.

**3. Not handling the edge cases**

The problem statement does not specify what to do if the given string is empty. One possible solution is to return `0` if the string is empty.

Another possible solution is to throw an exception if the string is empty.

It is important to handle the edge cases in order to ensure that your code is robust.

Title:
ATCODER p02654 AtCoder Grand Contest 045 - Lamps and Buttons

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of modulo operator**

The modulo operator (%) is used to return the remainder of a division operation. This means that if you divide two numbers, the modulo operator will return the value that is left over. For example, if you divide 10 by 3, the remainder is 1, so 10 % 3 = 1.

It is important to understand how the modulo operator works when you are using it in your code. For example, if you have two numbers that are both divisible by 3, the modulo operator will return the same value for both numbers. This can lead to errors in your code if you are not expecting it.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when you forget to add or subtract one from a number. This can be caused by a number of reasons, such as miscounting or typing the wrong number.

Off-by-one errors can be difficult to find because they often do not cause any obvious problems in your code. However, they can lead to incorrect results, so it is important to be aware of them.

**3. Using the wrong data type**

The data type that you use for a variable can have a significant impact on the performance of your code. For example, using a floating-point number for a variable that only stores whole numbers can lead to rounding errors.

It is important to choose the right data type for each variable in your code. This will help to ensure that your code is efficient and accurate.

**4. Not using enough memory**

If you do not allocate enough memory for your variables, your code may crash or produce incorrect results. This is because your code will try to store data in memory that does not exist.

It is important to make sure that you allocate enough memory for all of the variables in your code. This will help to prevent errors and ensure that your code runs smoothly.

**5. Using the wrong algorithm**

The algorithm that you use to solve a problem can have a significant impact on the performance of your code. For example, using a brute-force algorithm to solve a problem can be very inefficient.

It is important to choose the right algorithm for each problem that you solve. This will help to ensure that your code is efficient and accurate.

**6. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before you deploy it to production. This will help to identify any bugs or errors in your code before they cause problems for your users.

There are a number of different ways to test your code. You can use unit tests, integration tests, and system tests.

By testing your code, you can help to ensure that it is reliable and works as expected.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect understanding of the problem statement**

The problem statement is not very clear, so it is easy to make mistakes in understanding it. For example, one might think that the person in front of the first person is the last person in the queue, when in fact it is the second person.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the solution**

The solution to this problem is not trivial, and it is easy to make mistakes in the implementation. For example, one might forget to update the state of the people in the queue after each operation.

**3. Incorrect test cases**

The test cases for this problem are not very comprehensive, so it is easy to miss bugs that only appear on certain inputs. For example, one might not test the case where the number of operations is greater than the length of the queue.

**4. Incorrect analysis of the solution**

The time and space complexity of the solution to this problem are not very obvious, so it is easy to make mistakes in the analysis. For example, one might think that the time complexity is O(N^2), when in fact it is O(N).

**5. Incorrect submission**

When submitting the solution to this problem, it is important to make sure that the code is formatted correctly and that all of the required files are included. For example, one might forget to include the input and output files.

Title:
ATCODER p03345 AtCoder Grand Contest 024 - Fairness

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input values are all integers between 1 and 10^9. However, the output value can be as large as 10^18. If we use an integer data type to store the output value, it is possible that the value will overflow. To avoid this problem, we can use a long long data type to store the output value.

**2. Using the wrong formula**

The formula for calculating the output value is:

```
T - N = (A + B + C) * K - (A + B) * K - (B + C) * K - (C + A) * K
```

However, if we accidentally use the following formula, the output value may be incorrect:

```
T - N = (A + B + C) * K
```

**3. Not handling the special case where the absolute value of the output value exceeds 10^18**

If the absolute value of the output value exceeds 10^18, we need to print `Unfair` instead of the output value. We can do this by checking if the absolute value of the output value is greater than or equal to 10^18. If it is, we print `Unfair`. Otherwise, we print the output value.

Title:
AIZU p00076 Treasure Hunt II

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make mistakes. For example, if you forget to put a space between the number and the newline character, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.

**2. Incorrect calculation**

The calculation of the treasure's location is relatively simple, but it is easy to make mistakes. For example, if you forget to add or subtract the correct amount, the program will output the wrong answer.

**3. Off-by-one error**

When calculating the treasure's location, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, if you forget to increment or decrement the counter by one, the program will output the wrong answer.

**4. Floating-point error**

The output of the program is a floating-point number, so it is subject to floating-point error. This means that the output may not be exactly correct, even if the program is correct.

**5. Undefined behavior**

The C++ standard does not define the behavior of the program in some cases. For example, if you divide a number by zero, the program may crash or output an incorrect value. It is important to be aware of these undefined behaviors and to avoid them when possible.

Title:
AIZU p01579 Substring Expression

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of pointers**

When traversing a tree, it is important to make sure that pointers are not dangling. A dangling pointer is a pointer that points to a memory location that has been deallocated. This can happen when a tree is deleted or when a subtree is removed from a tree. If a dangling pointer is used, it can lead to undefined behavior, such as crashing the program.

To avoid dangling pointers, it is important to use a reference instead of a pointer when traversing a tree. A reference is a pointer that is bound to a specific object. When a reference is used, the object that it points to cannot be deleted or modified. This prevents dangling pointers from occurring.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a programmer accidentally counts one too many or one too few items. This can happen when iterating over a list of items, when calculating the size of an array, or when comparing two numbers. Off-by-one errors can lead to incorrect results or even crashes.

To avoid off-by-one errors, it is important to be careful when counting and comparing items. It is also helpful to use a debugger to check the values of variables and to make sure that they are correct.

**3. Memory leaks**

A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to a gradual increase in the amount of memory that is used by the program, which can eventually cause the program to crash.

To avoid memory leaks, it is important to free any memory that is allocated by the program. This can be done using the `free()` function in C or the `delete()` operator in C++.

**4. Incorrect data types**

Using the wrong data type can lead to incorrect results or even crashes. For example, if a program expects an integer but is given a string, the program will likely crash.

To avoid incorrect data types, it is important to make sure that the data types are correct. This can be done by using a type checker or by manually checking the data types.

**5. Logic errors**

Logic errors occur when a program does not behave the way that it is supposed to. This can happen when a programmer makes a mistake in the logic of the program.

To avoid logic errors, it is important to carefully review the code and to make sure that it is correct. It is also helpful to use a debugger to check the behavior of the program.

Title:
AIZU p02300 Convex Hull

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the convex hull algorithm.** The convex hull algorithm is a well-known algorithm for finding the smallest convex polygon that contains a given set of points. However, there are many different implementations of this algorithm, and it is important to choose one that is correct and efficient. If the algorithm is incorrect, it will not find the correct convex hull, and the output will be incorrect.
2. **Incorrect input handling.** The input to the problem is a list of points, each represented by two integers. It is important to make sure that the input is correctly parsed and that no errors are introduced during this process. If the input is not handled correctly, the output will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect output formatting.** The output of the problem should be a list of points, each represented by two integers. It is important to make sure that the output is correctly formatted and that no errors are introduced during this process. If the output is not formatted correctly, it will be difficult to read and understand, and the problem will not be scored correctly.
4. **Memory leaks.** The convex hull algorithm can be implemented in a way that uses a lot of memory. It is important to make sure that any memory that is allocated is freed when it is no longer needed. If memory leaks occur, the program will eventually run out of memory and crash.
5. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.** The convex hull algorithm involves a lot of calculations with floating-point numbers. It is important to make sure that these calculations are done correctly, and that no errors are introduced due to rounding errors or other problems. If floating-point numbers are not used correctly, the output of the algorithm will be incorrect.
6. **Incorrect handling of degenerate cases.** The convex hull algorithm can sometimes encounter degenerate cases, such as when all of the points are collinear or when the convex hull is a single point. It is important to make sure that these cases are handled correctly, and that the output of the algorithm is still correct. If degenerate cases are not handled correctly, the output of the algorithm will be incorrect.

Title:
AIZU p02447 Sorting Pairs

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect sorting order.** The program may not sort the points by the x-coordinate first, or by the y-coordinate in case of a tie. This could lead to incorrect output.
