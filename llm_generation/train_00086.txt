Title:
CODECHEF cr02

Pain points:
* **Incorrect factorial calculation.** The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120. However, some developers may incorrectly calculate the factorial of a number by multiplying all the numbers from 1 to that number, including the number itself. This will result in an incorrect answer.
* **Incorrect handling of zeroes.** The number of zeroes at the end of a factorial is equal to the number of factors of 5 in the factorial. For example, 10! has 2 factors of 5 (5 and 10), so it has 2 zeroes at the end. However, some developers may incorrectly count the number of zeroes by simply counting the number of times the digit 0 appears in the factorial. This will result in an incorrect answer.
* **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.** Some developers may incorrectly use floating-point numbers when calculating the number of zeroes at the end of a factorial. This can lead to rounding errors, which can result in an incorrect answer.
* **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 = 1. Some developers may incorrectly use the modulo operator to calculate the number of zeroes at the end of a factorial. This can lead to an incorrect answer.
* **Incorrect use of the factorial function.** Some programming languages have a built-in factorial function that can be used to calculate the factorial of a number. However, some developers may incorrectly use this function. This can lead to an incorrect answer.

Title:
CODECHEF rainbowb

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect modulo operation**

The modulo operator '%' in Python returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand. For example, 10 % 3 = 1. This means that 10 divided by 3 gives a quotient of 3 with a remainder of 1.

In the problem statement, we are asked to output the number of different Rainbow Arrays with N elements, modulo 10^9+7. This means that we need to find the remainder of the number of different Rainbow Arrays with N elements when divided by 10^9+7.

One common mistake that developers make is to forget to perform the modulo operation when calculating the number of different Rainbow Arrays with N elements. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following code:

```
def count_rainbow_arrays(n):
  # This code is incorrect because it does not perform the modulo operation
  return (n // 1) * (n // 2) * (n // 3) * (n // 4) * (n // 5) * (n // 6) * (n // 7) * (n // 6) * (n // 5) * (n // 4) * (n // 3) * (n // 2) * (n // 1)

print(count_rainbow_arrays(10))
```

This code will output 1024, which is not the correct answer. The correct answer is 0, because there are no Rainbow Arrays with 10 elements.

To avoid this mistake, make sure to perform the modulo operation when calculating the number of different Rainbow Arrays with N elements.

**2. Incorrect factorial calculation**

Another common mistake that developers make is to incorrectly calculate the factorial of a number. The factorial of a number n is the product of all the numbers from 1 to n. For example, 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.

In the problem statement, we are asked to calculate the number of different Rainbow Arrays with N elements. This can be calculated by multiplying the factorials of the number of elements in each block of the Rainbow Array. For example, the number of different Rainbow Arrays with 15 elements can be calculated as follows:

```
15! / (1! * 2! * 3! * 4! * 5! * 6! * 7! * 6! * 5! * 4! * 3! * 2! * 1!)
```

This calculation is correct because it correctly multiplies the factorials of the number of elements in each block of the Rainbow Array.

One common mistake that developers make is to forget to multiply the factorials of the number of elements in each block of the Rainbow Array. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, the following code will output the wrong answer for the number of different Rainbow Arrays with 15 elements:

```
def count_rainbow_arrays(n):
  # This code is incorrect because it does not multiply the factorials of the number of elements in each block of the Rainbow Array
  return 15!

print(count_rainbow_arrays(15))
```

This code will output 1307674368000, which is not the correct answer. The correct answer is 7.

To avoid this mistake, make sure to multiply the factorials of the number of elements in each block of the Rainbow Array.

**3. Incorrect use of the modulo operator**

The modulo operator '%' in Python returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand. For example, 10 % 3 = 1. This means that 10 divided by 3 gives a quotient of 3 with a remainder of 1.

In the problem statement, we are asked to output the number of different Rainbow Arrays with N elements, modulo 10^9+7. This means that we need to find the remainder of the number of different Rainbow Arrays with N elements when divided by 10^9+7.

One common mistake that developers make is to incorrectly use the modulo operator. For example, the following code will output the wrong answer for the number of different Rainbow Arrays with 15 elements:

```
def count_rainbow_arrays(n):
  # This code is incorrect because it incorrectly uses the modulo operator
  return (n // 1) * (n // 2) * (n // 3) * (n // 4) * (n // 
Test inputs:
**1. Incorrect modulo operation**

```
n = int(input())

def count_rainbow_arrays(n):
  return (n // 1) * (n // 2) * (n // 3) * (n // 4) * (n // 5) * (n // 6) * (n // 7) * (n // 6) * (n // 5) * (n // 4) * (n // 3) * (n // 2) * (n // 1)

print(count_rainbow_arrays(n))
```

This code will output 1024, which is not the correct answer. The correct answer is 0, because there are no Rainbow Arrays with 10 elements.

**2. Incorrect factorial calculation**

```
n = int(input())

def count_rainbow_arrays(n):
  return 15!

print(count_rainbow_arrays(n))
```

This code will output 1307674368000, which is not the correct answer. The correct answer is 7.

**3. Incorrect use of the modulo operator**

```
n = int(input())

def count_rainbow_arrays(n):
  return (n // 1) * (n // 2) * (n // 3) * (n // 4) * (n // 5) * (n // 6) * (n // 7) * (n // 6) * (n // 5) * (n // 4) * (n // 3) * (n // 2) * (n // 1) % 10**9+7

print(count_rainbow_arrays(n))
```

This code will output 7, which is not the correct answer. The correct answer is 7.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1061_D. TV Shows

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm.** The greedy algorithm for this problem is to sort the TV shows by their end times, and then rent a TV for each TV show in order. However, this algorithm may not always give the optimal solution. For example, if there are two TV shows with the same end time, the greedy algorithm will rent two TVs for those two shows, even though it is possible to rent one TV for both shows.
2. **Using the wrong data type.** The input data for this problem is very large, so it is important to use the correct data type to store the data. For example, if the input data is stored as integers, the answer may overflow.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** It is easy to make off-by-one errors when implementing the greedy algorithm for this problem. For example, you may forget to add the cost of renting the first TV to the total cost.
4. **Incorrect modulo arithmetic.** It is important to be careful when doing modulo arithmetic in this problem. For example, you may accidentally calculate the cost of renting a TV for more minutes than it actually airs.
5. **Using the wrong algorithm.** There are other algorithms that can be used to solve this problem, such as dynamic programming. These algorithms may be more efficient than the greedy algorithm.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1083_C. Max Mex

Pain points:
The following are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect implementation of the MEX function.** The MEX function should return the smallest non-negative integer that is not included in the given set. A common mistake is to return the smallest integer in the set, which is not correct.
* **Incorrect implementation of the DFS traversal.** The DFS traversal should visit all nodes in the tree in a depth-first order. A common mistake is to visit the nodes in a breadth-first order, which will not give the correct answer.
* **Incorrect implementation of the query processing.** The query processing logic should correctly handle both types of queries. A common mistake is to only handle one type of query, or to handle both types of queries incorrectly.
* **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The code should handle all possible edge cases, such as empty trees, trees with only one node, and trees with cycles. A common mistake is to not handle these edge cases correctly, which can lead to incorrect results.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems and bugs:

* **Test your code thoroughly.** This is the best way to find and fix errors in your code. Make sure to test your code with a variety of input data, including both valid and invalid data.
* **Use a debugger to step through your code.** This can help you identify errors in your code that are difficult to find with a text editor.
* **Consult with other programmers.** If you are stuck on a problem, don't be afraid to ask for help from other programmers. There are many online forums and communities where you can get help with programming problems.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1102_E. Monotonic Renumeration

Pain points:
### Possible Problems

1. **Incorrect implementation of the monotonicity constraint.** The monotonicity constraint requires that for every pair of indices `i` and `j` such that `1 <= i, j <= n`, if `a_i = a_j`, then `b_i = b_j`. This means that if two elements in the array are equal, then their corresponding values in the monotonic renumeration must also be equal. A common mistake is to forget to check for this constraint when updating the monotonic renumeration.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the increment constraint.** The increment constraint requires that for every index `i` in `[1, n - 1]`, either `b_i = b_{i + 1}` or `b_i + 1 = b_{i + 1}`. This means that for every pair of adjacent elements in the monotonic renumeration, either the values are equal or they differ by 1. A common mistake is to forget to check for this constraint when updating the monotonic renumeration.
3. **Incorrect modulo arithmetic.** The output of the problem must be modulo `998244353`. This means that when performing arithmetic operations on the values in the monotonic renumeration, it is important to take care to perform the operations modulo `998244353`. A common mistake is to forget to do this, which can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** The input and output of the problem are both indexed from `1`. This means that when iterating over the elements of the array, it is important to start at index `1` and end at index `n`. A common mistake is to start or end the iteration at the wrong index, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Possible Bugs

1. **Off-by-one errors.** The input and output of the problem are both indexed from `1`. This means that when iterating over the elements of the array, it is important to start at index `1` and end at index `n`. A common mistake is to start or end the iteration at the wrong index, which can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Arithmetic errors.** When performing arithmetic operations on the values in the monotonic renumeration, it is important to take care to perform the operations modulo `998244353`. A common mistake is to forget to do this, which can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Memory errors.** The monotonic renumeration can be quite large, so it is important to allocate enough memory to store it. A common mistake is to allocate too little memory, which can lead to the program crashing.
4. **Time errors.** The monotonic renumeration can be quite large, so it is important to implement an efficient algorithm to compute it. A common mistake is to implement an inefficient algorithm, which can lead to the program running slowly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1172_F. Nauuo and Bug

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulus.** The modulus used in the code is `p`, but the input may contain numbers greater than `p`. This will cause the code to produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect range of numbers.** The code assumes that all numbers in the input are in the range `[0, p)`. However, the input may contain numbers outside of this range. This will cause the code to produce incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the sum.** The code uses the following formula to calculate the sum of a range of numbers:

```
Sum(a, l, r, p) = a[l] + Sum(a, l + 1, r - 1, p) + a[r]
```

This formula is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the numbers in the range may be negative. This can cause the sum to be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The code does not handle overflow correctly. This can cause the code to produce incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect use of pointers.** The code uses pointers incorrectly. This can cause the code to crash or produce incorrect results.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it produces correct results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1270_F. Awesome Substrings

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input string can be very long, so it's important to use a data type that can store it without overflowing. For example, using `char` to store the string is not safe, because a `char` can only store a single character.

**2. Undefined behavior**

The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input string contains invalid characters. For example, if the input string contains a character other than `0` or `1`, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When counting the number of awesome substrings, it's important to make sure that you don't count the same substring twice. For example, the substring `101` should only be counted once, even though it can be obtained from the string `10101` by deleting the first and last characters.

**4. Incorrect assumptions**

The problem statement states that "length of the string is divisible by the number of 1 in it". However, this is not always true. For example, the string `110` has two 1s, but its length is not divisible by 2.

**5. Using incorrect algorithms**

The naive algorithm for counting the number of awesome substrings is to iterate over all possible substrings and check if each substring is awesome. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is too slow for large inputs.

A more efficient algorithm is to use dynamic programming. The idea is to store the number of awesome substrings ending at each position in the string. This allows us to quickly calculate the number of awesome substrings for any given substring. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), which is much faster than the naive algorithm.

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correctly parsed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is `1 2 3 4 5 6`, the first line will be parsed as `1 2 3 4 5 6`, which is not correct.
* **Incorrect data type:** The input data may be of the wrong type, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is `1 2 3 a 4 5 6`, the first line will be parsed as `1 2 3 a 4 5 6`, which is not correct.
* **Incorrect algorithm:** The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the algorithm used is to brute force all possible solutions, the time complexity will be exponential, which is not efficient.
* **Incorrect implementation:** The implementation of the algorithm may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the implementation uses a incorrect data structure, the time complexity may be incorrect.
* **Incorrect test cases:** The test cases used to verify the correctness of the solution may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the test cases only test for simple cases, the solution may not work for more complex cases.
* **Incorrect debugging:** The debugging process may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the debugger is not used correctly, the developer may not be able to identify the source of the bug.

**How to avoid these problems and bugs:**

* **Use the correct input format:** Make sure that the input format is correctly parsed. For example, use `<int>` to parse an integer, and `<float>` to parse a float.
* **Use the correct data type:** Make sure that the input data is of the correct type. For example, use `int` for integers, and `float` for floats.
* **Use the correct algorithm:** Use an efficient algorithm to solve the problem. For example, use a greedy algorithm or a dynamic programming algorithm.
* **Use the correct implementation:** Implement the algorithm correctly. For example, use the correct data structures and use the correct syntax.
* **Use the correct test cases:** Test the solution with a variety of test cases. For example, test the solution with simple cases, medium cases, and hard cases.
* **Use the correct debugging techniques:** Use the correct debugging techniques to identify the source of the bug. For example, use a debugger to step through the code and watch the values of the variables.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1313_C2. Skyscrapers (hard version)

Pain points:
## 1. Incorrect input format

The input format for this problem is `n m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`. `n` is the number of plots, and `m_i` is the maximum number of floors for the `i`th plot. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash.

## 2. Undefined behavior

The C++ standard does not specify the behavior of a program when it is passed invalid input. This means that a program is free to do anything it wants when it encounters invalid input, including crashing, printing garbage output, or even modifying the state of the computer.

In this problem, it is important to be careful to check for invalid input and handle it gracefully. For example, if the input contains a negative number, the program should print an error message and exit.

## 3. Off-by-one errors

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. In this problem, an off-by-one error could cause the program to incorrectly calculate the maximum number of floors that can be built on each plot.

For example, suppose the input is `5 1 2 3 4 5`. The maximum number of floors that can be built on each plot is `5`, but if the programmer forgets to increment `i` by one in the loop, the program will only build four floors on each plot.

## 4. Floating-point errors

Floating-point numbers are not exact representations of real numbers. This means that when a floating-point number is used in a calculation, the result may be slightly different from the expected value.

In this problem, floating-point errors could cause the program to incorrectly calculate the maximum number of floors that can be built on each plot. For example, suppose the input is `10 10 10`. The maximum number of floors that can be built on each plot is `10`, but if the program uses floating-point numbers, the result may be slightly less than `10`.

## 5. Memory leaks

A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

In this problem, a memory leak could occur if the program does not properly free the memory that it allocates for the skyscrapers. This could eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

## 6. Race conditions

A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same shared resource at the same time. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results or crashing.

In this problem, a race condition could occur if two threads try to update the maximum number of floors that can be built on a plot at the same time. This could lead to the program incorrectly calculating the maximum number of floors that can be built on the plot.
Test inputs:
### Incorrect input format

```
1 2 3 4 5
```

This input is incorrect because it does not have the correct number of arguments. The correct input format is `n m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`.

### Undefined behavior

```
-1 2 3 4 5
```

This input is invalid because it contains a negative number. The C++ standard does not specify the behavior of a program when it is passed invalid input, so it is possible that the program will crash or produce incorrect output.

### Off-by-one errors

```
5 1 2 3 4 5
```

This input is incorrect because the maximum number of floors that can be built on each plot is `5`, but the program only builds four floors on each plot. This is because the programmer forgot to increment `i` by one in the loop.

### Floating-point errors

```
10.0 10.0 10.0
```

This input is incorrect because the maximum number of floors that can be built on each plot is `10`, but the program uses floating-point numbers, which are not exact representations of real numbers. This means that the program may build slightly less than 10 floors on each plot.

### Memory leaks

```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  int *m = new int[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> m[i];
  }

  // This code leaks memory because the `m` array is never freed.
  return 0;
}
```

This program leaks memory because the `m` array is never freed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

### Race conditions

```
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  int *m = new int[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    m[i] = 0;
  }

  std::thread t1([&]() {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      m[i] = m[i] + 1;
    }
  });

  std::thread t2([&]() {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      m[i] = m[i] + 1;
    }
  });

  t1.join();
  t2.join();

  // This code may produce incorrect results because the two threads are updating the `m` array at the same time.
  return 0;
}
```

This program may produce incorrect results because the two threads are updating the `m` array at the same time. This can lead to the program incorrectly calculating the maximum number of floors that can be built on each plot.
Title:
CODEFORCES 1336_A. Linova and Kingdom

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input and output may not be consistent, which may cause the program to output incorrect results. For example, if the input is a string and the output is an integer, the program may output an incorrect result.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The program may miss or add one or more elements when processing the input, which may cause the program to output incorrect results. For example, if the program is supposed to count the number of elements in a list, but it misses one element, the program will output an incorrect result.
4. **Infinite loop**. The program may enter an infinite loop if it does not have any way to terminate. For example, if the program is supposed to print the first 100 elements of a list, but it does not have any way to stop, the program will enter an infinite loop.
5. **Memory leak**. The program may not release the memory that it has allocated, which may eventually cause the program to crash. For example, if the program creates a large array and does not free it when it is finished with it, the program will eventually run out of memory and crash.
6. **Race condition**. The program may not be thread-safe, which may cause it to produce incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time. For example, if two threads are trying to update the same variable at the same time, the program may output an incorrect value for the variable.
7. **Deadlock**. The program may deadlock if two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, which will prevent any of the threads from making progress. For example, if two threads are both trying to acquire a lock on the same resource, the program will deadlock.
8. **Security vulnerability**. The program may have a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the program or its data. For example, if the program does not properly validate user input, an attacker may be able to inject malicious code into the program.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may not be a single integer, or the output may be a negative integer.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of hugs**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the maximum number of hugs that can be obtained by visiting Coronavirus-chan on a given day. For example, the developer may not take into account the fact that the number of days in a month may not be a multiple of the number of days in a year.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. The developer may not handle edge cases correctly. For example, the developer may not handle the case where the number of months in a year is 1, or the case where the number of days in a month is 1.

CODEFORCES 1375_I. Cubic Lattice

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may not contain a single integer n on the first line, or the coordinates of the points may not be integers.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may not contain a single integer r^2 on the first line, or the coordinates of the vectors may not be integers.
3. **Incorrect calculation of r**. The maximum possible value of r is not calculated correctly. For example, the maximum possible value of r may be smaller than the square of the distance between two points in the set A.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the vectors \vec r_1, \vec r_2, and \vec r_3**. The vectors \vec r_1, \vec r_2, and \vec r_3 are not orthogonal or do not have the same length.
5. **Incorrect handling of degenerate cases**. The problem statement does not specify how to handle degenerate cases, such as when the set A contains only one point or when all of the points in the set A are collinear.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to carefully check your calculations to make sure that you have correctly found the maximum possible value of r and the vectors \vec r_1, \vec r_2, and \vec r_3.

CODEFORCES 1399_E1. Weights Division (easy version)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the divide-and-conquer algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The divide-and-conquer algorithm works by recursively splitting the problem into smaller and smaller subproblems until they are simple enough to be solved directly. However, if the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect, it is possible that the subproblems will not be solved correctly, which will lead to incorrect results for the overall problem.
2. **Using an incorrect data structure.** The data structure used to store the problem data can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. For example, using a linked list to store the problem data will be much slower than using a hash table.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve a given problem. The choice of algorithm can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. For example, using a brute-force algorithm to solve a problem will be much slower than using a more efficient algorithm.
4. **Not handling special cases correctly.** Some problems have special cases that need to be handled differently from the general case. For example, a problem that involves finding the minimum value in a list of numbers needs to handle the case where the list is empty. If this special case is not handled correctly, the algorithm will not work correctly.
5. **Using incorrect data.** The data used to solve a problem can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. For example, using incorrect data can lead to the algorithm running in an infinite loop.
6. **Not testing the algorithm thoroughly.** It is important to test the algorithm thoroughly before using it in a production environment. This will help to catch any bugs that may be present in the algorithm.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design and implement the algorithm, and to test it thoroughly before using it in a production environment.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1442_A. Extreme Subtraction

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a list of integers. If you use the wrong data type to store the input data, you may get incorrect results. For example, if you use a list of strings to store the input data, you may get incorrect results because the strings will be compared lexicographically instead of numerically.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The correct algorithm for this problem is to sort the input data and then repeatedly apply the following operation until all elements are equal to zero:

```
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] > 0:
        a[i] -= 1
```

If you use the wrong algorithm, you may get incorrect results. For example, if you use a brute-force algorithm to solve this problem, you may get incorrect results because the brute-force algorithm will take a long time to run and may not even terminate.

**3. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

The boundary conditions for this problem are that n must be a positive integer and each element of a must be a positive integer. If you do not check for these boundary conditions, you may get incorrect results. For example, if you do not check for the boundary condition that n must be a positive integer, you may get incorrect results for test cases where n is equal to zero.

**4. Using incorrect variable names**

The variable names used in your code should be clear and concise. If you use incorrect variable names, your code will be difficult to read and understand. For example, if you use the variable name "a" to store the input data, it will be difficult to distinguish between the input data and the array that you are using to store the results.

**5. Using incorrect indentation**

The indentation in your code should be consistent. If you do not use consistent indentation, your code will be difficult to read and understand. For example, if you indent some lines of code but not others, it will be difficult to see which lines of code belong to which blocks of code.

**6. Using incorrect comments**

The comments in your code should be clear and concise. If you use incorrect comments, your code will be difficult to read and understand. For example, if you use comments that are too long or too short, it will be difficult to understand what the comments are trying to say.

**7. Using incorrect spacing**

The spacing in your code should be consistent. If you do not use consistent spacing, your code will be difficult to read and understand. For example, if you use spaces between some operators but not others, it will be difficult to see which operators are being used.

* The input format is not clear. Is the first line the number of queries, or is it the first query?
* The input format does not specify how the customers are numbered. Are they numbered from 1 to n, where n is the number of customers, or are they numbered from 0 to n - 1?
* The output format does not specify how the customers are numbered. Are they numbered from 1 to n, where n is the number of customers, or are they numbered from 0 to n - 1?
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if there are multiple customers who have not been served yet. Does the waiter who serves the customer first get to choose which customer to serve, or does the waiter who serves the customer last get to choose which customer to serve?
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if there are multiple customers who are expected to spend the same amount of money. Does the waiter who serves the customer first get to choose which customer to serve, or does the waiter who serves the customer last get to choose which customer to serve?

**Possible Bugs**

* The program might not correctly handle the input format.
* The program might not correctly handle the output format.
* The program might not correctly handle the case where there are multiple customers who have not been served yet.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1492_B. Card Deck

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The problem states that `n` is an integer, but the solution code defines `n` as a float. This will cause the code to fail when `n` is not an integer.
2. **Incorrect loop condition.** The problem states that the loop should run until `original_deck` is empty, but the solution code uses `i < n` as the loop condition. This will cause the code to continue looping even after `original_deck` is empty.
3. **Incorrect calculation of `order`.** The problem states that `order` is equal to the sum of `n^n-i * p_i` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, but the solution code only sums `n^n-i * p_i` for `i` from 1 to `k`. This will cause the code to underestimate the value of `order`.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The problem states that the output should be a list of integers, but the solution code prints the list as a string. This will cause the output to be invalid.
5. **Incorrect use of `sorted()`.** The problem states that the output should be the deck with the maximum possible order, but the solution code uses `sorted()` to sort the deck in ascending order. This will cause the output to have a lower order than the optimal solution.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that your code correctly implements the required solution. You should also test your code thoroughly to make sure that it produces the correct output for all possible inputs.

CODEFORCES 1515_C. Phoenix and Towers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain a space between two integers, or it may contain a newline character instead of a space. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The input data may be of the wrong data type. For example, the input may contain a string instead of an integer. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** The program may make off-by-one errors when calculating the values of variables. For example, the program may subtract 1 from an index instead of adding 1 to it. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output.
4. **Logic errors.** The program may contain logic errors that cause it to produce incorrect output. For example, the program may not check for all possible cases. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output.
5. **Memory errors.** The program may run out of memory if it is not properly designed. This can cause the program to crash.
6. **Timeout errors.** The program may take too long to run if it is not properly optimized. This can cause the program to time out.

CODEFORCES 1542_B. Plus and Multiply

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for `a`, `b`, or `n`.**
   
This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. For example, if you declare `a`, `b`, and `n` as integers, you may get incorrect results if any of them are very large. To avoid this, you should declare them as long integers.

**2. Not initializing `a`, `b`, or `n`.**
   
If you don't initialize `a`, `b`, or `n`, they will be assigned the default value of zero. This can lead to incorrect results if any of them are negative. To avoid this, you should initialize them to a value that is guaranteed to be positive.

**3. Using the wrong operator for `a`, `b`, or `n`.**
   
You need to use the correct operator for `a`, `b`, and `n`. For example, you should use the `+` operator to add them, and the `*` operator to multiply them. Using the wrong operator can lead to incorrect results.

**4. Not handling the edge cases.**
   
There are a few edge cases that you need to handle when solving this problem. For example, what happens if `n` is equal to 1? What happens if `a` or `b` is zero? You need to make sure that your code handles these cases correctly.

**5. Not using the most efficient algorithm.**
   
There are a few different ways to solve this problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. You should use the most efficient algorithm that you can.

**6. Not testing your code.**
   
It is important to test your code to make sure that it is correct. You should test your code with a variety of different inputs to make sure that it handles all of the possible cases.

Title:
CODEFORCES 16_B. Burglar and Matches

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not specified in the problem statement. So a developer may assume that the input format is different from what it actually is. For example, a developer may assume that the input format is `n m`, where `n` is the number of matchboxes and `m` is the number of matches in each matchbox. This will cause the developer to get a `ValueError` when trying to parse the input.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not specified in the problem statement. So a developer may assume that the output format is different from what it actually is. For example, a developer may assume that the output format is `n`, where `n` is the maximum number of matches that the burglar can carry away. This will cause the developer to get a `TypeError` when trying to convert the output to an integer.

**3. Overflow**

The problem statement states that `n` can be as large as `2·10^8`. This means that the sum of the number of matches in all of the matchboxes can be as large as `2·10^8`. If the developer does not handle overflow properly, this could cause the program to crash.

**4. Incorrect algorithm**

The developer may come up with an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the developer may try to sort the matchboxes by the number of matches in each matchbox and then take the top `n` matchboxes. This would not work because the burglar cannot carry away more than `n` matchboxes.

**5. Incorrect implementation**

The developer may implement the algorithm incorrectly. For example, the developer may not correctly update the maximum number of matches that the burglar can carry away as they iterate through the matchboxes. This would cause the developer to get an incorrect answer.

**6. Unit tests**

The developer should write unit tests to verify that their code is correct. This will help to catch bugs early on in the development process.

**7. Code review**

The developer should have their code reviewed by another developer to catch any potential bugs. This will help to ensure that the code is correct and efficient.

Title:
CODEFORCES 18_E. Flag 2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible that the user will enter incorrect data. For example, the user may enter a negative number for the number of rows or columns, or they may enter a string instead of a number. The developer should check the input format and throw an error if it is incorrect.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is possible that the user will enter incorrect data. For example, the user may output a number that is not an integer, or they may output a string instead of a number. The developer should check the output format and throw an error if it is incorrect.
3. **Incorrect algorithm.** The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the developer may not account for all of the constraints in the problem statement, or they may not use the most efficient algorithm. The developer should carefully test their algorithm to ensure that it is correct.
4. **Memory leaks.** The developer may not properly manage memory, which can lead to memory leaks. Memory leaks can cause the program to crash or run slowly. The developer should use a memory management tool to track memory usage and identify memory leaks.
5. **Synchronization issues.** The developer may not properly synchronize threads, which can lead to race conditions. Race conditions can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash. The developer should use a synchronization mechanism to ensure that threads are properly synchronized.
6. **Security vulnerabilities.** The developer may not properly protect the program from security vulnerabilities. For example, the developer may not properly sanitize user input, which can lead to an attacker injecting malicious code into the program. The developer should use a security framework to protect the program from security vulnerabilities.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a negative number or a number that is greater than 200000.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The solution may not be correct. For example, the solution may count the number of subsequences of b that are equal to a, instead of the number of subsequences of b that are a shifted by d.
4. **Memory limit exceeded**. The solution may use too much memory. For example, the solution may create a hash table of all the elements in b.
5. **Time limit exceeded**. The solution may take too long to run. For example, the solution may use a brute-force approach to find all the subsequences of b that are a shifted by d.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test your solution on a variety of test cases, including cases that are not explicitly mentioned in the problem statement.

Title:
CODEFORCES 311_C. Fetch the Treasure

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format for this problem is not very strict. For example, the input `10 3 5 2 5 50 7 60 8 100 2 2 5 3 1 3 3` is valid, but it is not a good idea to use this format. The reason is that it is easy to make mistakes when writing the input. For example, if you accidentally write `2 2 5 3 1 3` instead of `2 2 5 3 1 3 3`, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.

To avoid this problem, you should always use the correct input format. In this case, the correct input format is `10 3 5 2\n5 50\n7 60\n8 100\n2 2 5\n3\n1 3\n3\n3`.

The reason is that it is easy to make mistakes when writing the input. For example, if you accidentally write `10 3 5 2 5 50 7 60 8 100 2 2 5 3 1 3 3.0`, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.

To avoid this problem, you should always use the correct data type. In this case, the correct input data type is `int` and the correct output data type is `int`.

### 4. Incorrect logic

The logic for this problem is not very complicated. However, it is easy to make mistakes when writing the logic. For example, if you accidentally write `max(a, b) = a + b`, the program will not work correctly.

To avoid this problem, you should always carefully check your logic before submitting your solution.

### 5. Incorrect implementation

The implementation for this problem is not very complicated. However, it is easy to make mistakes when writing the implementation. For example, if you accidentally write `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`, the program will not work correctly.

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is not very straightforward, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading in the data. For example, you might forget to include the newline character at the end of each line of input, or you might accidentally swap two of the numbers in a line. This can lead to incorrect results.
* **Incorrect data type:** The data for this problem is all integers, but it is easy to accidentally cast a string to an integer or vice versa. This can lead to incorrect results.
* **Off-by-one errors:** The input for this problem is a grid of numbers, and it is easy to make a mistake when counting the number of rows or columns. This can lead to incorrect results.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic for this problem is not very complex, but it is easy to make a mistake when writing it. For example, you might forget to check for a specific condition or you might use the wrong variable. This can lead to incorrect results.
* **Memory leaks:** The Floyd-Warshall algorithm uses a lot of memory, and it is easy to create a memory leak when implementing it. This can lead to your program crashing or running out of memory.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input format. You should also test your code thoroughly to make sure that it produces the correct results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 427_E. Police Patrol

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not very clear. It is not clear whether the first line contains the number of criminals and the capacity of the patrol car, or the number of criminals and the positions of the criminals. This can lead to errors in parsing the input.

**2. Overflow**

The absolute value of the positions of the criminals can be very large. This can lead to overflow errors if the positions are not properly represented.

**3. Sorting the criminals**

The positions of the criminals are given in non-decreasing order. However, this is not always the case. The criminals may be given in any order. This can lead to errors if the criminals are not sorted before computing the minimum distance.

**4. Finding the minimum distance**

The minimum distance between the police station and the criminals can be computed in different ways. One way is to simply iterate over all the criminals and compute the distance from the police station to each criminal. However, this can be very inefficient if there are a large number of criminals. A more efficient way is to use a binary search to find the position of the police station that minimizes the total distance.

**5. Printing the output**

The output of the problem should be a single integer, that means the minimum possible distance you need to cover to catch all the criminals. However, it is possible to print the output in a way that is not correct. For example, the output could be a floating-point number instead of an integer.

**6. Other errors**

There are a number of other possible errors that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the developer may not correctly handle the case where there are no criminals, or the case where the capacity of the patrol car is zero. The developer may also not correctly handle the case where the criminals are not located on the x-axis.
Test inputs:
**1. Incorrect input format**

```
3 6
1 2 3
```

This input is incorrect because it does not contain the capacity of the patrol car.

**2. Overflow**

```
1000000000 1000000000
```

This input will cause an overflow error because the absolute value of the positions of the criminals is too large.

**3. Sorting the criminals**

```
5 5
-7 -6 -3 -1 1
```

This input is not sorted in non-decreasing order. This can lead to errors when computing the minimum distance.

**4. Finding the minimum distance**

```
1000000000 1000000000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

This input contains a large number of criminals. It would be inefficient to iterate over all the criminals and compute the distance from the police station to each criminal. A more efficient way would be to use a binary search to find the position of the police station that minimizes the total distance.

**5. Printing the output**

```
1000000000 1000000000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

The output of this program is 1000000000. However, the correct output should be 500000000.

**6. Other errors**

```
0 0
```

This input contains no criminals. The developer should handle this case correctly.

```
1 0
0
```

This input contains a criminal at position 0. The developer should handle this case correctly.

```
1 1
-1 1
```

This input contains two criminals at positions -1 and 1. The developer should handle this case correctly.

Pain points:
**1. The input data may not be a valid distance matrix of a weighted tree.**

For example, the input data may contain a negative value, or a value that is greater than the sum of the distances between the two nodes.

**2. The developer may not correctly implement the algorithm for finding the distance matrix of a weighted tree.**

The algorithm for finding the distance matrix of a weighted tree is not trivial. The developer may make mistakes in implementing the algorithm, which could lead to incorrect results.

**3. The developer may not correctly check if the input data is a valid distance matrix of a weighted tree.**

The developer may not correctly implement the algorithm for checking if the input data is a valid distance matrix of a weighted tree. This could lead to the developer incorrectly accepting invalid input data, or incorrectly rejecting valid input data.

**4. The developer may not correctly handle corner cases.**

There are a number of corner cases that the developer must handle correctly. For example, the developer must handle the case where the input data contains a single node, or the case where the input data contains two nodes that are connected by an edge.

**5. The developer may not correctly handle errors.**

The developer must correctly handle errors that occur during the execution of the program. For example, the developer must handle the case where the input data is not a valid distance matrix of a weighted tree.

CODEFORCES 637_B. Chat Order

Pain points:
 
 **1. Using an incorrect data type to store the chat list.**

The chat list is a sequence of strings, so it should be stored in a data type that can hold strings. For example, a list of strings can be stored in a Python list.

**2. Not handling the case where a message is sent to a friend who is not already in the chat list.**

In this case, the new chat should be inserted at the top of the list. This can be done by using the `insert()` method of the list data type.

**3. Not handling the case where a message is sent to a friend who is already in the chat list.**

In this case, the chat should be moved to the top of the list. This can be done by using the `remove()` and `insert()` methods of the list data type.

**4. Not handling the case where the chat list is empty.**

In this case, the output should be an empty list. This can be done by using the `list()` constructor.

Title:
CODEFORCES 665_B. Shopping

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect variable type**

One common mistake is to use the wrong variable type. For example, you might try to store a person's age in a variable of type `int`, but this will cause an error because ages can be fractional. To avoid this, you should always use the correct variable type for the data you are storing.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

Another common mistake is to make an off-by-one error. This happens when you forget to add or subtract one from a calculation, which can lead to incorrect results. To avoid this, you should always double-check your calculations to make sure that you have not made any mistakes.

**3. Logical errors**

Logical errors are errors in the logic of your code. These can be difficult to find, but they can cause your program to behave in unexpected ways. To avoid logical errors, you should always test your code thoroughly and make sure that it does what you expect it to do.

**4. Undefined behavior**

Undefined behavior is behavior that is not specified by the programming language. This can happen when you try to do something that the language does not support, or when you use a variable in a way that the language does not allow. Undefined behavior can lead to your program crashing or producing incorrect results. To avoid undefined behavior, you should always make sure that you are using the language correctly.

**5. Memory leaks**

Memory leaks occur when you allocate memory for a variable but then forget to free it up when you are finished with it. This can lead to your program running out of memory and crashing. To avoid memory leaks, you should always free up memory that you are no longer using.

**6. Security vulnerabilities**

Security vulnerabilities are weaknesses in your code that can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to your system. To avoid security vulnerabilities, you should always follow good security practices, such as using strong passwords and encrypting sensitive data.

**7. Performance issues**

Performance issues can occur when your code is not efficient. This can make your program run slowly or use more resources than necessary. To avoid performance issues, you should always optimize your code as much as possible.

CODEFORCES 689_E. Mike and Geometry Problem

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the segment tree.** The segment tree is a data structure that can be used to efficiently answer range queries on a given array. However, if the implementation of the segment tree is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the segment tree is not properly initialized, it may not be able to answer range queries correctly.
2. **Incorrect use of the segment tree.** The segment tree can be used to answer a variety of range queries, but it is important to use the segment tree correctly in order to get the correct results. For example, if the segment tree is used to answer a range query that is not supported by the segment tree, it may return incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The segment tree can be used to handle large arrays, but it is important to handle overflow correctly in order to avoid incorrect results. For example, if the segment tree is used to store values that are larger than the maximum value that can be represented by the data type of the segment tree, it may overflow and return incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic.** The segment tree is often used to answer range queries on arrays of integers modulo a prime number. However, it is important to use modulo arithmetic correctly in order to avoid incorrect results. For example, if the segment tree is used to answer a range query on an array of integers that are not all positive, it may return incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect use of the bitwise AND operator.** The bitwise AND operator is often used to perform range queries on a segment tree. However, it is important to use the bitwise AND operator correctly in order to avoid incorrect results. For example, if the bitwise AND operator is used to perform a range query on a segment tree that is not a binary tree, it may return incorrect results.

    * Using a brute-force approach to search for all possible colorings of the trees and then selecting the one with the minimum cost. This approach would be very inefficient, as the number of possible colorings grows exponentially with the number of trees.
    * Using a greedy algorithm to color the trees one at a time, without considering the overall cost of the coloring. This approach could lead to a coloring that is not optimal in terms of cost.
    * Using an incorrect heuristic to estimate the cost of a coloring. This could lead to the selection of a coloring that is not actually optimal.
4. **Incorrect implementation.** Even if the algorithm used to solve this problem is correct, the implementation of the algorithm must be correct in order to produce the correct output. There are a number of possible errors that could be made in the implementation, such as:
    * Using incorrect data types for the input and output values.
    * Using incorrect variable names or variable scopes.
    * Making incorrect assumptions about the input data.
    * Using incorrect mathematical formulas or algorithms.
5. **Runtime errors.** The program may also crash due to runtime errors, such as:
    * Division by zero errors.
    * Array out-of-bounds errors.
    * Memory allocation errors.
    * File I/O errors.
6. **Logic errors.** The program may also produce incorrect output due to logic errors, such as:
    * Using the wrong variable in an expression.
    * Forgetting to check for a condition.
    * Using an incorrect algorithm.
    * Making an incorrect assumption about the input data.
7. **Other errors.** There are a number of other possible errors that could occur when solving this problem, such as:
    * Typographical errors.
    * Spelling errors.
    * Misunderstanding the problem statement.
    * Forgetting to submit the solution on time.

Title:
CODEFORCES 732_C. Sanatorium

Pain points:

 In the fourth sample, Vasiliy could have arrived before breakfast on the first day, have been in the sanatorium for two days (including the day of arrival) and then have left after breakfast on the third day, not missing any meal.  **1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains three integers, so we need to use an integer data type to store them. However, if we use an integer data type that is too small, we may get an overflow error. For example, if we use a 32-bit integer to store the number of breakfasts, dinners, and suppers, we may get an overflow error if any of these numbers is greater than 2147483647.

**2. Not considering all possible cases**

The problem states that "Vasiliy doesn't remember what was the time of the day when he arrived to sanatorium (before breakfast, before dinner, before supper or after supper), and the time when he left it (before breakfast, before dinner, before supper or after supper)". So we need to consider all possible cases when Vasiliy arrived and left the sanatorium.

**3. Misunderstanding the problem statement**

The problem statement is a bit tricky. It is easy to misunderstand the problem statement and think that we need to find the minimum number of meals that Vasiliy **definitely** missed. However, the problem statement actually asks us to find the minimum number of meals that Vasiliy **could** have missed. This means that we need to consider all possible cases when Vasiliy arrived and left the sanatorium.

**4. Using incorrect logic**

The following is an incorrect solution to the problem:

```
def solve():
    # Get the input.
    b, d, s = map(int, input().split())

    # Find the minimum number of meals that Vasiliy could have missed.
    missed = max(b, d, s) - 1

    # Print the answer.
    print(missed)

# Solve the problem.
solve()
```

This solution is incorrect because it does not consider all possible cases when Vasiliy arrived and left the sanatorium. For example, if Vasiliy arrived before breakfast, had breakfast, and then left after dinner, the solution would say that he missed 0 meals, even though he actually missed 1 meal (the supper).

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it to the judge. This will help you to catch any bugs in your code and ensure that it is correct.

Here are some tips for testing your code:

* Use a variety of test cases, including both positive and negative cases.
* Make sure that your code handles all possible errors gracefully.
* Test your code on multiple platforms.
* Run your code through a debugger to help you find bugs.

By following these tips, you can help to ensure that your code is correct and that it will run successfully on the judge.

Title:
CODEFORCES 756_D. Bacterial Melee

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data contains integers, so you should use `int` or `long long` to store them. Using `string` or `char` to store integers will cause problems when performing arithmetic operations. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
int n;
cin >> n;
string s;
cin >> s;
```

This code will try to store the integer `n` in a `string` variable, which will cause an error. To fix this, you can either change the type of `n` to `int` or `long long`, or you can use the `stoi` function to convert the string `s` to an integer.

**2. Using incorrect algorithms**

The problem asks you to find the number of different configurations of bacteria in the testtube. One possible way to solve this problem is to use the following algorithm:

1. Initialize a variable `count` to 1.
2. For each region in the testtube, do the following:
    * If the region is empty, then increment `count` by 1.
    * Otherwise, multiply `count` by the number of different types of bacteria in the region.
3. Return `count`.

This algorithm will work correctly, but it is not very efficient. A more efficient algorithm is to use dynamic programming. Dynamic programming is a technique that can be used to solve problems by storing the results of subproblems and using them to solve larger problems. In this case, we can use dynamic programming to store the number of different configurations of bacteria in the testtube after each possible sequence of attacks.

**3. Using incorrect modular arithmetic**

The problem asks you to find the answer modulo 109 + 7. This means that you need to perform all arithmetic operations modulo 109 + 7. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
int a = 100;
int b = 200;
int c = a + b;
```

This code will calculate the sum of `a` and `b` as 300, but the correct answer is 109 + 7 = 116. To fix this, you can use the `%` operator to perform modular arithmetic. For example, the following code will work correctly:

```
int a = 100;
int b = 200;
int c = (a + b) % (109 + 7);
```

**4. Not handling special cases correctly**

The problem states that the testtube can have at most 5000 regions. If you try to store the population of the testtube in a `string` variable, you will run out of memory if the testtube has more than 5000 regions. To avoid this problem, you can use a `vector` of `char`s to store the population of the testtube.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it to Codeforces. This will help you to catch any errors in your code and to make sure that it is correct. You can test your code using the following steps:

1. Write a test case that contains the input data for a simple problem.
2. Run your code on the test case and make sure that it produces the correct output.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for more complex test cases.

By testing your code, you can make sure that it is correct and that it will be able to handle all of the possible input data.

CODEFORCES 802_C. Heidi and Library (hard)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as expected. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or the number of elements in a list may not match the expected number.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as expected. For example, the output may contain a non-numeric value, or the number of elements in a list may not match the expected number.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect. For example, the program may not correctly calculate the minimum cost of buying books, or it may not correctly handle all possible input cases.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program may not release memory that it has allocated, which can lead to a memory leak.
5. **Race conditions**. The program may not be thread-safe, which can lead to race conditions.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may have security vulnerabilities, such as allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data.
7. **Bugs in third-party libraries**. The program may use third-party libraries that contain bugs, which can lead to errors in the program.
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect input format**

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
c = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

This input is incorrect because the first line contains two integers, but the second line contains three integers. The third line also contains three integers, but the fourth line contains only one integer.

2. **Incorrect output format**

```
print(1)
```

This output is incorrect because it does not contain the minimum cost of buying books.

3. **Incorrect logic**

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
c = list(map(int, input().split()))

min_cost = 0
for i in range(n):
    if i % k == 0:
        min_cost += c[i]

print(min_cost)
```

This program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where k is greater than n. In this case, the program will incorrectly add the cost of the last book to the minimum cost.

4. **Memory leaks**

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
c = list(map(int, input().split()))

min_cost = 0
for i in range(n):
    if i % k == 0:
        min_cost += c[i]

print(min_cost)

del a
del c
```

This program has a memory leak because it does not delete the variables `a` and `c` after it is finished using them. This can lead to a memory leak if the program is run multiple times.

5. **Race conditions**

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
c = list(map(int, input().split()))

min_cost = 0
for i in range(n):
    if i % k == 0:
        min_cost += c[i]

print(min_cost)

t = threading.Thread(target=lambda: min_cost += c[n-1])
t.start()
t.join()
```

This program has a race condition because the two threads `main` and `t` are both accessing the variable `min_cost` without synchronization. This can lead to an incorrect value being stored in `min_cost`.

6. **Security vulnerabilities**

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
c = list(map(int, input().split()))

min_cost = 0
for i in range(n):
    if i % k == 0:
        min_cost += c[i]

print(min_cost)

print(a[n-1])
```

This program has a security vulnerability because it prints the value of the variable `a[n-1]`, which is user input. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the program.

7. **Bugs in third-party libraries**

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
c = list(map(int, input().split()))

min_cost = 0
for i in range(n):
    if i % k == 0:
        min_cost += c[i]

print(min_cost)

import math
print(math.sqrt(n))
```

This program has a bug because it uses the third-party library `math` to calculate the square root of `n`. However, the value of `n` is not guaranteed to be a positive number, so the square root of `n` may not be defined. This can lead to an error being thrown.

CODEFORCES 847_J. Students Initiation

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `m` lines of two integers `xi` and `yi`. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce incorrect output.

For example, the following input is incorrect:

```
n m
1 2
```

The correct input format is:

```
n m
2 1
1 2
```

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer, followed by `m` lines of two integers `xi` and `yi`. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly print the output and will produce incorrect output.

For example, the following output is incorrect:

```
1
1 2
```

The correct output format is:

```
1
1 2
2 1
```

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic for this problem is to find the minimum number of souvenirs that the unluckiest student will have to present. To do this, we can start by finding all of the pairs of students who are familiar with each other. Then, we can find the student who is not familiar with any other students. This student will be the unluckiest student and will have to present the most souvenirs.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5 4
2 1
1 3
2 3
2 5
```

The first step is to find all of the pairs of students who are familiar with each other. In this case, there are three pairs: (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3).

The next step is to find the student who is not familiar with any other students. In this case, the student who is not familiar with any other students is student 5.

Therefore, the unluckiest student will have to present 2 souvenirs.

The following is the incorrect logic for this problem:

```
# Find all of the pairs of students who are familiar with each other.
pairs = []
for i in range(m):
    xi, yi = map(int, input().split())
    pairs.append((xi, yi))

# Find the student who is not familiar with any other students.
unlucky_student = None
for i in range(n):
    if i not in pairs:
        unlucky_student = i
        break

# Find the minimum number of souvenirs that the unluckiest student will have to present.
min_souvenirs = 0
for pair in pairs:
    if pair[0] == unlucky_student:
        min_souvenirs += 1
    elif pair[1] == unlucky_student:
        min_souvenirs += 1

# Print the minimum number of souvenirs that the unluckiest student will have to present.
print(min_souvenirs)
```

This logic is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the unluckiest student may be familiar with more than one other student. For example, in the input above, the unluckiest student is student 5, who is familiar with students 1 and 2. Therefore, the unluckiest student will have to present 3 souvenirs, not 2.

CODEFORCES 869_E. The Untended Antiquity

Pain points:
1. The first attempt is infeasible, because the cell (1, 1) is blocked by a barrier.
2. The second attempt is feasible, because there are no barriers on the path from (4, 4) to (1, 1).

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is not in the correct format, the program may not be able to correctly identify the number of rows and columns in the grid, or the number of Oshino and Koyomi's actions.
* **Incorrect implementation of Oshino's actions:** The implementation of Oshino's actions may not be correct, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the implementation does not correctly check if the specified group of barriers exist on the ground before the removal, the program may incorrectly output "Yes" when Koyomi's attempt is actually infeasible.
* **Incorrect implementation of Koyomi's actions:** The implementation of Koyomi's actions may not be correct, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the implementation does not correctly check if there are any barriers on the path from (r1, c1) to (r2, c2), the program may incorrectly output "Yes" when Koyomi's attempt is actually infeasible.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correctly formatted, which can make it difficult to understand the results. For example, if the output is not in the correct format, it may be difficult to tell which Koyomi's attempts are feasible and which are not.

By following the tips below, you can help to avoid these problems and bugs:

* **Use a well-defined input format:** The input format should be clearly defined and easy to parse. This will help to ensure that the input is correctly processed and that the program produces the correct results.
* **Implement Oshino's actions correctly:** The implementation of Oshino's actions should correctly check if the specified group of barriers exist on the ground before the removal. This will help to ensure that the program correctly outputs "Yes" or "No" when Koyomi's attempt is feasible or infeasible, respectively.
* **Implement Koyomi's actions correctly:** The implementation of Koyomi's actions should correctly check if there are any barriers on the path from (r1, c1) to (r2, c2). This will help to ensure that the program correctly outputs "Yes" or "No" when Koyomi's attempt is feasible or infeasible, respectively.
* **Use the correct output format:** The output format should be clearly defined and easy to understand. This will help to make it easy to tell which Koyomi's attempts are feasible and which are not.

CODEFORCES 916_E. Jamie and Tree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the DFS traversal.**

The DFS traversal is a recursive algorithm that visits all vertices of a graph in a depth-first order. It is often used to find the connected components of a graph, or to find the shortest paths between two vertices.

In this problem, we need to implement a DFS traversal that visits all vertices of the tree in a post-order fashion. This means that we visit the children of a vertex before visiting the vertex itself.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing the DFS traversal is to forget to mark the vertices as visited as they go. This can lead to incorrect results, as the algorithm may visit the same vertex multiple times.

To avoid this mistake, we can use a visited array to keep track of which vertices have already been visited. We can then check the visited array before visiting a vertex to make sure that we don't visit it twice.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the union-find data structure.**

The union-find data structure is a data structure that can be used to find the connected components of a graph. It is often used to solve problems involving disjoint sets.

In this problem, we need to implement a union-find data structure that can handle negative weights. This is because the weights of the edges in the tree can be negative.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing the union-find data structure is to use an array to store the parent of each vertex. This can lead to incorrect results, as the array can become corrupted if the weights of the edges are negative.

To avoid this mistake, we can use a linked list to store the parent of each vertex. This will prevent the array from becoming corrupted, and it will also make the union-find data structure more efficient.

**3. Incorrect implementation of the subtree sum query.**

The subtree sum query is a query that asks for the sum of the values of all vertices in the subtree of a given vertex.

In this problem, we need to implement a subtree sum query that can handle negative weights. This is because the weights of the edges in the tree can be negative.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing the subtree sum query is to forget to update the subtree sum of a vertex when its value is changed. This can lead to incorrect results, as the subtree sum of a vertex may not be the same as the sum of the values of its children.

To avoid this mistake, we can use a separate array to store the subtree sum of each vertex. This will ensure that the subtree sum of a vertex is always up-to-date, even if its value is changed.

**4. Incorrect implementation of the update query.**

The update query is a query that adds a given value to the values of all vertices in the subtree of a given vertex.

In this problem, we need to implement an update query that can handle negative weights. This is because the weights of the edges in the tree can be negative.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing the update query is to forget to update the subtree sum of a vertex when its value is changed. This can lead to incorrect results, as the subtree sum of a vertex may not be the same as the sum of the values of its children.

To avoid this mistake, we can use a separate array to store the subtree sum of each vertex. This will ensure that the subtree sum of a vertex is always up-to-date, even if its value is changed.

**5. Incorrect implementation of the answer query.**

The answer query is a query that asks for the sum of the values of all vertices in the subtree of a given vertex.

In this problem, we need to implement an answer query that can handle negative weights. This is because the weights of the edges in the tree can be negative.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing the answer query is to forget to update the subtree sum of a vertex when its value is changed. This can lead to incorrect results, as the subtree sum of a vertex may not be the same as the sum of the values of its children.

To avoid this mistake, we can use a separate array to store the subtree sum of each vertex. This will ensure that the subtree sum of a vertex is always up-to-date, even if its value is changed.

Title:
CODEFORCES 992_C. Nastya and a Wardrobe

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect modulo operation**

When calculating the expected number of dresses, it is important to use the modulo operation correctly. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
def expected_number_of_dresses(x, k):
  """Calculates the expected number of dresses Nastya will own one year later."""

  # Iterate over the months in the year.
  for i in range(k + 1):
    # Double the number of dresses.
    x *= 2
    # If there is a 50% chance that the wardrobe eats a dress, subtract 1.
    if i < k:
      x -= 1
  # Return the expected number of dresses.
  return x % 109 + 7
```

The problem with this code is that the modulo operation is performed after the subtraction. This means that the result of the subtraction could be negative, which would cause an error.

To fix this, we need to perform the modulo operation before the subtraction. This can be done by using the following code:

```
def expected_number_of_dresses(x, k):
  """Calculates the expected number of dresses Nastya will own one year later."""

  # Iterate over the months in the year.
  for i in range(k + 1):
    # Double the number of dresses and perform the modulo operation.
    x = (x * 2) % 109 + 7
    # If there is a 50% chance that the wardrobe eats a dress, subtract 1 and perform the modulo operation.
    if i < k:
      x = (x - 1) % 109 + 7
  # Return the expected number of dresses.
  return x
```

**2. Incorrect calculation of the probability that the wardrobe eats a dress**

Another common mistake that developers make when solving this problem is to incorrectly calculate the probability that the wardrobe eats a dress. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
def expected_number_of_dresses(x, k):
  """Calculates the expected number of dresses Nastya will own one year later."""

  # Iterate over the months in the year.
  for i in range(k + 1):
    # Double the number of dresses.
    x *= 2
    # Calculate the probability that the wardrobe eats a dress.
    p = 0.5
    # If there is a 50% chance that the wardrobe eats a dress, subtract 1.
    if i < k:
      x -= 1 * p
  # Return the expected number of dresses.
  return x % 109 + 7
```

The problem with this code is that the probability that the wardrobe eats a dress is not actually 0.5. The probability that the wardrobe eats a dress is actually 1 - (1 / 2) ^ k, where k is the number of months in the year.

To fix this, we need to use the correct probability in the calculation. This can be done by using the following code:

```
def expected_number_of_dresses(x, k):
  """Calculates the expected number of dresses Nastya will own one year later."""

  # Iterate over the months in the year.
  for i in range(k + 1):
    # Double the number of dresses.
    x *= 2
    # Calculate the probability that the wardrobe eats a dress.
    p = 1 - (1 / 2) ** k
    # If there is a 50% chance that the wardrobe eats a dress, subtract 1.
    if i < k:
      x -= 1 * p
  # Return the expected number of dresses.
  return x % 109 + 7
```

**3. Incorrect calculation of the expected number of dresses**

Finally, another common mistake that developers make when solving this problem is to incorrectly calculate the expected number of dresses. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
def expected_number_of_dresses(x, k):
  """Calculates the expected number of dresses Nastya will own one year later."""

  # Iterate over the months in the year.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain more than one space between two numbers, or it may contain a space at the end of the input. The developer should check the input format and handle it correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correct. For example, the output may contain extra spaces, or it may not be capitalized correctly. The developer should check the output format and handle it correctly.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may make mistakes in the logic of the program. For example, the developer may not check for all possible cases, or the developer may not use the correct data structures. The developer should carefully check the logic of the program and fix any mistakes.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer may not free up memory that is no longer needed. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash. The developer should use the `free()` function to free up memory that is no longer needed.
5. **Synchronization issues**. The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. The developer should use locks or mutexes to synchronize access to shared data.
6. **Race conditions**. The developer may not properly handle race conditions. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. The developer should use locks or mutexes to prevent race conditions.
7. **Deadlocks**. The developer may create deadlocks in the program. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely. The developer should avoid creating deadlocks by using locks or mutexes in a careful way.
8. **Buffer overflows**. The developer may not properly check the size of buffers. This can cause the program to write data to memory that it is not allowed to access. This can lead to security vulnerabilities. The developer should use the `strlen()` function to check the size of buffers before writing data to them.
9. **Format string vulnerabilities**. The developer may not properly use format strings. This can lead to security vulnerabilities. The developer should use the `strftime()` function to format strings in a safe way.
10. **SQL injection vulnerabilities**. The developer may not properly sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries. This can lead to security vulnerabilities. The developer should use the `mysqli_real_escape_string()` function to sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries.

HACKEREARTH chemical-mixture

Pain points:
1. The input format is not clear. For example, it is not clear whether the capacities of the bottles of amulus are integers or real numbers.
2. The constraints are not clear. For example, it is not clear whether the capacities of the bottles of amulus are positive or negative.
3. The output format is not clear. For example, it is not clear whether the capacities of the bottles of amulus should be printed in increasing or decreasing order.
4. The problem statement is not clear. For example, it is not clear what happens if the chemist does not have enough bottles of amulus to make the mixture.
5. The test cases are not clear. For example, it is not clear what the expected output is for the second test case.

Here are some possible solutions to these problems:

1. The input format can be made clearer by specifying that the capacities of the bottles of amulus are integers and that they are separated by spaces.
2. The constraints can be made clearer by specifying that the capacities of the bottles of amulus are positive integers and that they are less than or equal to 10^17.
3. The output format can be made clearer by specifying that the capacities of the bottles of amulus should be printed in increasing order.
4. The problem statement can be made clearer by specifying that the chemist can use as many bottles of amulus as he wants, but he cannot use more than the total capacity of the bottles of amulus.
5. The test cases can be made clearer by specifying the expected output for each test case.

Here is a possible solution to the problem:

HACKEREARTH double-or-divide-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly using the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) should be used to ensure that the output is within the specified range. For example, if the input is 100 and the modulo operator is used with a modulus of 10, the output should be 0. However, if the modulo operator is not used, the output would be 10.
2. **Not handling negative numbers correctly.** The modulo operator (%) should be used to ensure that the output is positive. For example, if the input is -100 and the modulo operator is used with a modulus of 10, the output should be 0. However, if the modulo operator is not used, the output would be -10.
3. **Using the wrong data type.** The input and output data types should be specified in the problem statement. For example, if the input is a list of integers, the output should also be a list of integers.
4. **Not handling edge cases correctly.** The problem statement should specify what to do in edge cases. For example, what should happen if the input is empty?
5. **Not using the most efficient algorithm.** There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. The most efficient algorithm should be used to ensure that the solution is as fast as possible.

HACKEREARTH samu-and-special-coprime-numbers

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the coprime function**

The coprime function should check if two numbers are coprime, but it may incorrectly return true if they are not. This could lead to incorrect results when counting the number of special coprime numbers.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the sum of digits function**

The sum of digits function should return the sum of the digits of a number, but it may incorrectly return a different value. This could lead to incorrect results when counting the number of special coprime numbers.

**3. Incorrect implementation of the sum of squares of digits function**

The sum of squares of digits function should return the sum of the squares of the digits of a number, but it may incorrectly return a different value. This could lead to incorrect results when counting the number of special coprime numbers.

**4. Incorrect implementation of the main function**

The main function should read the input, call the coprime function, sum of digits function, and sum of squares of digits function, and then print the output. However, it may incorrectly do one of these things, which could lead to incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect input**

The input may not be in the correct format, or it may contain invalid values. This could lead to the coprime function, sum of digits function, and sum of squares of digits function being called with invalid arguments, which could lead to incorrect results.

HACKEREARTH super-two-letter-strings

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modular arithmetic.** When calculating the final answer, it is important to make sure that the answer is correctly modulo 1000000007. This can be done by using the following formula: ```
(a + b) % MOD = (a % MOD + b % MOD) % MOD
```

2. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over the possible strings, it is important to make sure that the index is incremented correctly. For example, if you are iterating over the set of strings of length 3, you would need to start at index 0 and increment by 1 each time.

3. **Incorrect use of data structures.** When storing the possible strings, it is important to use a data structure that is appropriate for the problem. For example, if you are only interested in the number of strings, you could use a set. However, if you need to access the strings themselves, you would need to use a list or a vector.

4. **Incorrect use of functions.** When using functions, it is important to make sure that you are passing the correct arguments and that you are using the functions correctly. For example, if you are using the `pow()` function to calculate the factorial of a number, you need to make sure that you pass the number as the first argument and the exponent as the second argument.

5. **Incorrect assumptions.** When solving a problem, it is important to make sure that you are not making any incorrect assumptions. For example, if you are trying to find the number of ways to arrange a set of objects, you cannot assume that the objects are all distinct.

Title:
HACKEREARTH what-time-is-it

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is HH:MM, where HH is the hour and MM is the minute. The hour must be in the range 0-12, and the minute must be in the range 0-59. If the input format is incorrect, the developer may get a ValueError.

**2. Invalid time**

The time must be a valid time. For example, 25:00 is not a valid time, because 25 is not a valid hour. If the input time is invalid, the developer may get a ValueError.

**3. Floating-point rounding errors**

The output angle is a floating-point number. When computing the angle, the developer may get rounding errors. To avoid this, the developer should use the `round()` function to round the angle to the desired number of decimal places.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

When computing the angle, the developer may make an off-by-one error. For example, the developer may forget to add 1 to the minute when computing the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand. To avoid this, the developer should carefully check their code for off-by-one errors.

**5. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The developer may implement the algorithm incorrectly. For example, the developer may forget to take into account the fact that the hour hand moves in increments of 30 degrees, while the minute hand moves in increments of 6 degrees. To avoid this, the developer should carefully read the problem statement and understand the algorithm before implementing it.

Title:
ATCODER p02624 AtCoder Beginner Contest 172 - Sum of Divisors

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes**. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple and efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given integer n. However, if it is implemented incorrectly, it can miss some prime numbers or count some non-prime numbers as prime. This can lead to incorrect results when computing the sum of divisors.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the sum of divisors**. The sum of divisors of a positive integer n is the sum of all positive integers that divide evenly into n. There are a few different ways to calculate this sum, but the most efficient way is to use the following formula:

```
∑d|n fd = n(n+1)/2
```

where fd is the number of positive divisors of n.
3. **Overflow errors**. When computing the sum of divisors, it is important to be aware of the possibility of overflow errors. This can happen when the sum of divisors is too large to be represented by the data type being used. To avoid this problem, it is necessary to use a data type that is large enough to hold the sum of divisors.
4. **Incorrect use of floating-point arithmetic**. Floating-point arithmetic is often used to compute the sum of divisors. However, floating-point arithmetic is not always accurate, and this can lead to incorrect results. To avoid this problem, it is important to use integer arithmetic whenever possible.
5. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that can occur when programming. In this problem, an off-by-one error could occur if the loop that computes the sum of divisors is not terminated correctly. This could lead to the sum of divisors being incorrect.
6. **Incorrect use of variables**. It is important to use variables correctly when programming. In this problem, a common mistake would be to use the same variable to store both the number of divisors and the sum of divisors. This could lead to incorrect results.
7. **Incorrect use of functions**. It is important to use functions correctly when programming. In this problem, a common mistake would be to call the Sieve of Eratosthenes function with the wrong arguments. This could lead to incorrect results.
8. **Incorrect use of libraries**. It is important to use libraries correctly when programming. In this problem, a common mistake would be to use the wrong library function to compute the sum of divisors. This could lead to incorrect results.
9. **Incorrect use of the programming language**. It is important to use the programming language correctly. In this problem, a common mistake would be to use a feature of the programming language that is not supported by the compiler. This could lead to compilation errors or incorrect results.
10. **Incorrect understanding of the problem**. The most important bug that a developer can encounter when solving this problem is to misunderstand the problem. This can lead to incorrect solutions that do not meet the problem specifications.

Title:
ATCODER p02755 AtCoder Beginner Contest 158 - Tax Increase

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect rounding**. When rounding the amount of consumption tax, it is important to round down to the nearest integer. For example, if the amount of consumption tax is 19.5 yen, it should be rounded down to 19 yen.
2. **Using the wrong tax rate**. The problem states that the consumption tax rate is 8 percent and 10 percent. It is important to use the correct tax rate for each price.
3. **Using the wrong formula**. The formula for calculating the price of a product before tax is `price = tax / (tax rate / 100) + 1`. It is important to use the correct formula to calculate the price.
4. **Not handling all possible cases**. The problem states that the price of a product before tax must be a positive integer. It is important to handle all possible cases, including cases where the price is negative or zero.
5. **Using incorrect data types**. The problem states that the input and output should be integers. It is important to use the correct data types to avoid errors.

Title:
ATCODER p02890 AtCoder Beginner Contest 143 - Distinct Numbers

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**

The input format is "N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N". However, the input may not have the correct format. For example, the input may be "N A_1 A_2 ... A_N". In this case, the program will crash.

**2. The output format is not correct**

The output format is "N integers. The t-th (1 <= t <= N) of them should be the answer for the case K=t.". However, the output may not have the correct format. For example, the output may be "1 2 3 4 5". In this case, the program will not pass the judge.

**3. The program does not handle the edge cases correctly**

The program should handle the edge cases correctly. For example, the program should handle the case when N = 0. In this case, the program should output an empty list.

**4. The program has a bug**

The program may have a bug. For example, the program may not correctly calculate the maximum number of times Takahashi can do the operation. In this case, the program will not pass the judge.

**5. The program is not efficient enough**

The program should be efficient enough to pass the judge. For example, the program should not take more than a few seconds to run. In this case, the program will not pass the judge.

Title:
ATCODER p03025 M-SOLUTIONS Programming Contest - Best-of-(2n-1)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect calculation of expected value**. The expected number of games that will be played is given by the following formula:

```
E = (A * (N + 1) + B * (N + 1) + C * (2N - 1)) / (A + B + C)
```

However, some developers may accidentally calculate the expected value as follows:

```
E = (A + B + C) * (N + 1) / 2
```

This will result in an incorrect answer.

2. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic**. When calculating the expected value, it is important to use modulo arithmetic correctly. For example, the following code will produce an incorrect answer:

```
r = (A * (N + 1) + B * (N + 1) + C * (2N - 1)) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

This is because the modulo operator (%) does not work correctly when the dividend is negative. To avoid this problem, we can use the following code instead:

```
r = (A * (N + 1) + B * (N + 1) + C * (2N - 1)) % (10 ** 9 + 7) + (10 ** 9 + 7)
r %= (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

3. **Incorrect use of the Euclidean algorithm**. The Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. It is often used to reduce fractions to their lowest terms. However, some developers may accidentally use the Euclidean algorithm incorrectly. For example, the following code will produce an incorrect answer:

```
gcd = gcd(A, B)
r = (A * (N + 1) + B * (N + 1) + C * (2N - 1)) // gcd
```

This is because the Euclidean algorithm does not work correctly when one of the integers is zero. To avoid this problem, we can use the following code instead:

```
if A == 0:
    gcd = B
elif B == 0:
    gcd = A
else:
    gcd = gcd(A, B)
r = (A * (N + 1) + B * (N + 1) + C * (2N - 1)) // gcd
```

Title:
ATCODER p03166 Educational DP Contest - Longest Path

Pain points:
Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input handling:** The input format is not very clear, so it is possible that the developer may misinterpret it and incorrectly parse the input. This could lead to incorrect results.
* **Incorrect graph representation:** The graph is represented as a list of edges, but it is possible that the developer may incorrectly implement the graph data structure. This could lead to incorrect results.
* **Incorrect traversal algorithm:** The longest path in a directed graph can be found using a variety of traversal algorithms. The developer may choose an incorrect algorithm or implement it incorrectly. This could lead to incorrect results.
* **Incorrect output formatting:** The output format is not very clear, so it is possible that the developer may incorrectly format the output. This could lead to the submission being rejected by the judge.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully read the problem statement and make sure they understand the input and output formats. They should also carefully implement the graph data structure and the traversal algorithm. Finally, they should carefully check the output formatting to make sure it is correct.

Title:
ATCODER p03309 AtCoder Beginner Contest 102 - Linear Approximation

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input is a list of integers, so the developer should use a list or array to store the values. Using the wrong data type, such as a string, will cause the program to crash.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks for the minimum possible sadness of Snuke. The developer can use a greedy algorithm to find the optimal value of b. A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that makes the best possible decision at each step, without considering the future. In this case, the developer can choose b to be the median of the list of integers.

**3. Using incorrect math**

The developer should be careful when calculating the sadness of Snuke. The sadness is calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the differences between the integers in the list and b+i. The developer should make sure to use the correct formula to calculate the absolute value of a number.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

The developer should test their program on edge cases to make sure that it works correctly. Some edge cases to consider include:

* The list of integers is empty.
* The list of integers contains only one integer.
* The list of integers contains all the same integer.

**5. Not using a unit test framework**

The developer should use a unit test framework to test their program. A unit test framework is a tool that helps developers write tests for their code. Unit tests can help developers find bugs in their code before they go into production.

Title:
ATCODER p03468 AtCoder Grand Contest 020 - Arcs on a Circle

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make mistakes when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the probability**

The probability that a point is covered by an arc is equal to the ratio of the length of the arc to the length of the circle. However, it is easy to make a mistake when calculating this ratio. For example, if you divide the length of the arc by the circumference of the circle, you will get the wrong answer.

**3. Incorrectly handling overlapping arcs**

When two arcs overlap, it is possible that they cover the same point. In this case, the probability that the point is covered by at least one arc is not equal to the sum of the probabilities that it is covered by each arc individually.

**4. Numerical errors**

When calculating the probability, it is important to use a high precision arithmetic library. Otherwise, the results may be inaccurate.

**5. Insufficient test cases**

It is important to test your program with a variety of input values to make sure that it works correctly in all cases. Otherwise, you may not find bugs that only occur with certain input values.

Title:
ATCODER p03630 AtCoder Regular Contest 081 - Flip and Rectangles

Pain points:
**1. Not handling the case where the input is invalid.** The input format specifies that `H` and `W` must be between 2 and 2000, and that each row of `S` must have the same length as `W`. If the input does not satisfy these constraints, the program should either output an error message or terminate abnormally.

**2. Not handling the case where the input contains invalid characters.** The input format specifies that `S` must consist of only the characters `#` and `.`. If the input contains any other characters, the program should either output an error message or terminate abnormally.

**3. Not handling the case where the output is too large.** The output format specifies that the output should be an integer. If the output is larger than an integer, the program should either output an error message or terminate abnormally.

**4. Not handling the case where the output is negative.** The output format specifies that the output should be non-negative. If the output is negative, the program should either output an error message or terminate abnormally.

**5. Not handling the case where the output is not an integer.** The output format specifies that the output should be an integer. If the output is not an integer, the program should either output an error message or terminate abnormally.

**6. Not handling the case where the output is not a valid rectangle.** A rectangle is a four-sided shape with four right angles. If the output does not represent a valid rectangle, the program should either output an error message or terminate abnormally.

**7. Not handling the case where the output is not the maximum possible area.** The goal of the problem is to find the maximum possible area of Snuke's rectangle. If the output is not the maximum possible area, the program should either output an error message or terminate abnormally.

Title:
ATCODER p03788 AtCoder Grand Contest 011 - Half Reflector

Pain points:
**1. Incorrectly computing the number of balls that enter each device.**

The problem states that "A ball that was thrown out from the right side of the i-th device from the left (1 \leq i \leq N-1) immediately enters the (i+1)-th device from the left side." This means that if the i-th device is in state A, then it will throw out a ball to the right and the ball will enter the (i+1)-th device. Similarly, if the i-th device is in state B, then it will throw out a ball to the left and the ball will enter the (i-1)-th device.

However, some developers may incorrectly compute the number of balls that enter each device. For example, they may incorrectly assume that if the i-th device is in state A, then it will throw out a ball to the right and the ball will enter the (i+1)-th device, and if the i-th device is in state B, then it will throw out a ball to the left and the ball will enter the (i-1)-th device. This is incorrect because the ball that is thrown out from the i-th device will not enter the same device again.

**2. Incorrectly computing the state of each device after K balls are processed.**

The problem states that "the i-th character in the output string must correspond to the state of the i-th device from the left." This means that if the i-th device is in state A, then the i-th character in the output string should be 'A', and if the i-th device is in state B, then the i-th character in the output string should be 'B'.

However, some developers may incorrectly compute the state of each device after K balls are processed. For example, they may incorrectly assume that if the i-th device is in state A, then the i-th character in the output string should be 'B', and if the i-th device is in state B, then the i-th character in the output string should be 'A'. This is incorrect because the state of each device changes after each ball is processed.

**3. Not handling the case where K is greater than the number of devices.**

The problem states that "the ball always comes out of the contraption after a finite time." This means that if K is greater than the number of devices, then the ball will eventually come out of the contraption. However, some developers may incorrectly assume that if K is greater than the number of devices, then the ball will never come out of the contraption. This is incorrect because the ball will eventually come out of the contraption, even if it takes a long time.

**4. Not handling the case where the input is invalid.**

The problem states that "1 \leq N \leq 200,000", "1 \leq K \leq 10^9", and "|S|=N". This means that the input must satisfy these constraints. However, some developers may incorrectly assume that the input will always satisfy these constraints. This is incorrect because the input may be invalid. For example, the input may contain a negative number, a number that is greater than 200,000, or a string that is not the same length as N.

**5. Not using efficient data structures and algorithms.**

The problem can be solved efficiently using data structures and algorithms such as a queue and a hash table. However, some developers may incorrectly use inefficient data structures and algorithms. For example, they may use a linked list instead of a queue or a hash table instead of a dictionary. This will make the solution slower and less efficient.

Title:
AIZU p01705 Square in Circles

Pain points:
The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are as follows:

1. **Incorrectly calculating the area of the square.** The area of the square is equal to the square of the side length. However, it is easy to make a mistake when calculating the side length. For example, you might accidentally calculate the distance between the centers of two circles instead of the distance between the edges of the circles.
2. **Incorrectly determining the largest possible square.** The largest possible square is the square that has the greatest area and is completely contained within the circles. It is important to make sure that the square is completely contained within the circles, otherwise it will not be the largest possible square.
3. **Incorrectly handling degenerate cases.** There are a few degenerate cases that you need to be aware of when solving this problem. For example, if there are no circles, then the largest possible square is a square with side length 0.
4. **Incorrectly handling floating-point errors.** The output must have an absolute or relative error at most $10^{-4}$. This means that you need to be careful when rounding your answers to make sure that they are accurate enough.

By following these tips, you can avoid these common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
AIZU p02131 Hth Number

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of data types.** The input is given as a string, but the developer may accidentally use an integer data type to store the input. This will cause the program to crash when it tries to access the characters in the string.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** The developer may accidentally miss a character when iterating over the string, or they may add a character that doesn't belong. This will cause the program to output an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The developer may make a mistake in the algorithm they use to find the Hth smallest value. This could result in the program outputting an incorrect answer, or it could cause the program to run in an infinite loop.
4. **Memory leaks.** The developer may not properly free the memory they allocate for the string. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
5. **Security vulnerabilities.** The developer may accidentally expose sensitive data to the user. This could allow the user to gain unauthorized access to the system.
Test inputs:
**Incorrect use of data types:**

```
n, h = map(int, input().split())
s = input()
print(int(s[0]))
```

**Off-by-one errors:**

```
n, h = map(int, input().split())
s = input()
print(s[h - 1])
```

**Incorrect logic:**

```
n, h = map(int, input().split())
s = input()

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
        print(s[i:j])

print(h)
```

**Memory leaks:**

```
n, h = map(int, input().split())
s = input()

while h > 0:
    print(s[0])
    h -= 1
```

**Security vulnerabilities:**

```
n, h = map(int, input().split())
s = input()

print(s)
```
Title:
AIZU p02272 Merge Sort

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one errors.** The most common mistake when implementing Merge Sort is to make an off-by-one error in the indices of the subarrays being merged. For example, in the pseudocode for Merge, the index `k` should start at `left` and end at `right - 1`, not `right`.
2. **Incorrectly handling the sentinel values.** The sentinel values in Merge Sort are used to ensure that the two subarrays being merged are always sorted. If the sentinel values are not handled correctly, the resulting array will not be sorted.
3. **Not using a stable merge algorithm.** A stable merge algorithm preserves the original order of equal elements in the two subarrays being merged. If a non-stable merge algorithm is used, the resulting array may not be the same as the original array.
4. **Not using an in-place merge algorithm.** An in-place merge algorithm does not require any extra space to merge the two subarrays. This can be a significant advantage when the input array is large.
5. **Not using a recursive merge algorithm.** A recursive merge algorithm is more efficient than an iterative merge algorithm, especially for large input arrays.

Title:
AIZU p02419 Finding a Word

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly comparing strings for equality.** The problem statement specifies that the word and text are case insensitive, so we need to make sure that we are comparing the strings in a case-insensitive manner. One way to do this is to use the `str.lower()` method to convert both strings to lowercase before comparing them.
2. **Not handling the end of the text correctly.** The problem statement specifies that the text will be terminated by the string `"END_OF_TEXT"`. We need to make sure that we check for this string and stop processing the text once we have found it.
3. **Incorrectly counting the number of occurrences of the word.** We need to make sure that we only count the occurrences of the word that are actually in the text. For example, if the word `"computer"` appears in the text as `"comPUter"`, we should not count this as an occurrence of the word.
4. **Using an inefficient algorithm.** The naive algorithm for counting the number of occurrences of a word in a text is to iterate over the text and check each string to see if it matches the word. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the text. However, we can improve the efficiency of this algorithm by using a more efficient data structure, such as a hash table.
5. **Not handling errors correctly.** The problem statement does not specify what should happen if there is an error reading the input or writing the output. We need to make sure that we handle any errors that occur gracefully.
Test inputs:
```
word = input()
text = ""
while True:
    try:
        text += input() + " "
    except EOFError:
        break

count = 0
for line in text.split():
    if word.lower() == line.lower():
        count += 1

print(count)
```
