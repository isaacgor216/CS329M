Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by commas. The developer should check the input format and handle any errors appropriately.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not always correct. For example, the output may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be rounded to the correct number of decimal places. The developer should check the output format and handle any errors appropriately.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the area of the cake pieces.** The developer may incorrectly calculate the area of the cake pieces. For example, the developer may not take into account the fact that the cake pieces may not be rectangular. The developer should carefully calculate the area of the cake pieces and ensure that the correct answer is returned.
4. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The developer may incorrectly implement the algorithm for dividing the cake. For example, the developer may not correctly handle the case where the two cuts intersect. The developer should carefully implement the algorithm and ensure that the correct answer is returned.
5. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The developer may not correctly handle edge cases. For example, the developer may not correctly handle the case where one of the cuts is outside the cake. The developer should carefully handle all edge cases and ensure that the correct answer is returned.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1061_C. Multiplicity

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The most common mistake is to implement the algorithm incorrectly. This can happen for a number of reasons, such as:

* Misunderstanding the problem statement
* Making a mistake in the implementation
* Using incorrect data types
* Not handling all possible edge cases

To avoid this, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement, and then carefully implement the algorithm. It is also important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly on all possible inputs.

**2. Using incorrect data types**

Another common mistake is to use incorrect data types. For example, if the problem requires you to find the number of elements in an array, you should use an integer data type, not a floating-point data type. Using the wrong data type can lead to incorrect results.

To avoid this, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you are using the correct data types.

**3. Not handling all possible edge cases**

Many problems have edge cases that must be handled correctly in order to get the correct answer. For example, if the problem asks you to find the maximum value in an array, you must handle the case where the array is empty. If you do not handle this case correctly, your code will not work correctly on all inputs.

To avoid this, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and identify all of the possible edge cases. Then, you must make sure that your code handles these cases correctly.

**4. Using inefficient algorithms**

Another common mistake is to use inefficient algorithms. For example, if you are asked to find the longest common substring in two strings, you should use the dynamic programming algorithm, not the brute-force algorithm. Using the wrong algorithm can lead to your code running very slowly.

To avoid this, it is important to choose an efficient algorithm for the problem you are solving. You can find information about efficient algorithms online or in textbooks.

**5. Not testing your code**

Finally, it is important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly on all possible inputs. This can be done by writing unit tests or by manually testing your code. Testing your code will help you to catch bugs and ensure that your code is correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1083_B. The Fair Nut and Strings

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input format is ```
n, k
s
t
```
but the input is ```
2, 4
aa
bb
```
the program will fail to parse the input.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input may not be correct, which may lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input is ```
2, 4
aa
bb
```
but the program expects the input to be integers, the program will fail.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are common in programming, and they can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program is supposed to count the number of elements in an array, but it starts counting from 0 instead of 1, the result will be off by one.
4. **Logic errors**. Logic errors are errors in the logic of the program, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program is supposed to find the maximum value in an array, but it doesn't check for negative values, the maximum value will not be found.
5. **Memory errors**. Memory errors can occur when the program allocates too much or too little memory, which can lead to the program crashing or giving incorrect results. For example, if the program allocates too much memory, it may run out of memory and crash.
6. **Timeout errors**. Timeout errors can occur when the program takes too long to run, which can lead to the program being terminated before it finishes. For example, if the program is supposed to solve a problem in a certain amount of time, but it takes longer than that, the program will be terminated and the problem will not be solved.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can occur when the program is not properly written, which can lead to unauthorized access to data or other malicious activities. For example, if the program is not properly sanitized, it may be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1102_D. Balanced Ternary String

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is a string, but the developer may mistakenly use an integer to store it. This will cause the program to crash.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the number of replacements**

The number of replacements is calculated by subtracting the number of '0's from the number of '1's. However, the developer may mistakenly subtract the number of '1's from the number of '0's. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**3. Incorrect string comparison**

The program must compare the strings lexicographically. However, the developer may mistakenly compare them using the `==` operator. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output must be a string. However, the developer may mistakenly print an integer or a list of characters. This will cause the program to crash.

**5. Other bugs**

There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. Some common examples include:

* Using the wrong data structure
* Making a mistake in the algorithm
* Not handling errors correctly

By following the tips below, you can avoid these common problems and write a correct and efficient solution to this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1130_D1. Toy Train (Simplified)

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format specifies that the first line should contain two space-separated integers, `n` and `m`, where `n` is the number of stations and `m` is the number of candies. However, if the input format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the input is `5 7` instead of `5 7`, the program may crash because it expects two space-separated integers but only receives one.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The input data is given as a string, but the program may expect it to be a number. For example, if the input is `5 7`, the program may crash because it expects two integers but only receives one string.

**3. Undefined variable**

The program may use a variable that is not defined. For example, if the program tries to access the variable `a` before it is assigned a value, the program will crash.

**4. Off-by-one error**

The program may calculate the wrong answer because it is off by one. For example, if the program is supposed to find the minimum distance between two points, but it calculates the distance between the first point and the second point, the program will be off by one.

**5. Infinite loop**

The program may enter an infinite loop if it does not have a way to terminate. For example, if the program is supposed to print the numbers from 1 to 10, but it does not have a way to stop, the program will print the numbers from 1 to 10 forever.

**6. Memory leak**

The program may leak memory if it does not release the memory that it has allocated. For example, if the program allocates memory for an array, but it does not free the memory when it is finished with the array, the program will leak memory.

**7. Race condition**

The program may experience a race condition if two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. For example, if two threads try to update the same variable at the same time, the program may produce incorrect results.

**8. Deadlock**

The program may deadlock if two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. For example, if two threads are each waiting for the other thread to release a lock, the program will deadlock.

 1. **Incorrect implementation of the DFS algorithm.** The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that can be used to traverse a graph. It works by starting at a single vertex and recursively exploring all of its adjacent vertices. However, if the implementation of the DFS algorithm is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect use of the visited array.** The visited array is a data structure that is used to keep track of which vertices have already been visited during a DFS traversal. If the visited array is not used correctly, it can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of different colors on a path.** The number of different colors on a path can be calculated by simply counting the number of unique colors that appear on the path. However, if the calculation is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement specifies a number of edge cases that must be handled correctly. If these edge cases are not handled correctly, it can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect use of the input/output streams.** The input/output streams are used to read and write data from/to the console. If the use of the input/output streams is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements. It is also important to carefully implement the DFS algorithm and to use the visited array and the number of different colors on a path correctly. Finally, it is important to handle all of the edge cases correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1190_B. Tokitsukaze, CSL and Stone Game

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect logic**

A common mistake is to incorrectly implement the logic of the game. For example, you might forget to check if a pile is empty before removing a stone from it, or you might not correctly update the state of the game after a move. This can lead to incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect data type**

Another common mistake is to use the wrong data type for the piles of stones. For example, you might use an integer to store the number of stones in a pile, when you actually need to use a floating-point number. This can lead to incorrect results, especially if the number of stones in a pile is large.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that can occur when you are iterating over a list of items. For example, you might accidentally iterate over the list one element too many or one element too few. This can lead to incorrect results.

**4. Undefined behavior**

Undefined behavior is a type of error that can occur when you use a programming language in a way that is not specified by the language's documentation. This can lead to unpredictable results, which can be difficult to debug.

**5. Memory leaks**

A memory leak occurs when you allocate memory for an object but you do not free the memory when you are finished with it. This can eventually lead to your program running out of memory and crashing.

**6. Race conditions**

A race condition occurs when two or more threads of execution try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even to your program crashing.

**7. Deadlocks**

A deadlock occurs when two or more threads of execution are each waiting for the other to release a resource that it is holding. This can prevent any of the threads from making progress and can eventually lead to your program crashing.

**8. Buffer overflows**

A buffer overflow occurs when you write more data to a buffer than it can hold. This can overwrite adjacent memory locations, which can lead to incorrect results or even to your program crashing.

* **Incorrect testing.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. This means testing your solution on a variety of input data, including both correct and incorrect inputs.
* **Incorrect submission.** Once you are sure that your solution is correct, you need to submit it to the judge correctly. Make sure that you follow the submission instructions carefully.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement:** A developer might think that the goal is to maximize the sum of the absolute values of the elements in each row, when in reality the goal is to maximize the sum of the maximum values in each row.
* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm:** A developer might implement an algorithm that only works for a specific type of input, when in reality the algorithm should work for any type of input. For example, a developer might implement an algorithm that only works for square matrices, when in reality the algorithm should work for any rectangular matrix.
* **Incorrect testing:** A developer might test their solution on a small number of input cases, when in reality the solution should be tested on a large number of input cases. This can lead to the developer overlooking a bug that only occurs on certain input cases.
* **Incorrect submission:** A developer might submit their solution to the judge in a format that is not recognized by the judge. This can lead to the developer's solution being rejected, even if the solution is correct.

CODEFORCES 1270_E. Divide Points

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It expects a single integer on the first line, followed by n lines of two integers each. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to parse the input and will likely crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also very specific. It expects two lines of output: the first line should contain a single integer, the number of points in group A; the second line should contain a list of the indices of the points in group A, separated by spaces. If the output format is not correct, the program will not be accepted by the judge.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve this problem must be correct in order to produce the correct output. There are a number of ways to solve this problem, but not all of them are correct. For example, an incorrect algorithm might try to find a partition of the points such that the sum of the distances between points in the same group is minimized. This is not a valid solution to the problem, because it is possible to find a partition of the points such that the sum of the distances between points in the same group is equal to the sum of the distances between points in different groups.

**4. Incorrect implementation**

Even if the algorithm used to solve this problem is correct, the implementation of the algorithm must be correct in order to produce the correct output. For example, the implementation must correctly handle all of the edge cases, such as the case where all of the points are collinear.

**5. Runtime errors**

The program must be able to run within the time limit specified by the problem. If the program runs too slowly, it will not be accepted by the judge.

**6. Memory errors**

The program must not use more memory than the amount specified by the problem. If the program uses too much memory, it will not be accepted by the judge.

**7. Compilation errors**

The program must compile without errors. If the program does not compile, it will not be accepted by the judge.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1440_E. Greedy Shopping

Pain points:
**Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs:**

1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** This is the most common mistake that can be made when solving a problem. It is important to read the problem statement carefully and make sure that you understand all of the details. In this problem, for example, it is important to understand that the array `a` is non-increasing and that the hungry man can only buy a meal in a shop if he has at least `a_i` money.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** Once you have understood the problem statement, you need to come up with a solution and implement it in code. This is where many bugs can occur. It is important to carefully test your code to make sure that it is correct. In this problem, for example, you need to make sure that you are correctly updating the array `a` when you process a `1` query and that you are correctly calculating the number of meals that the hungry man can buy when you process a `2` query.
3. **Runtime errors.** When you are solving a problem, it is important to make sure that your code runs in a reasonable amount of time. In this problem, for example, you need to make sure that your code does not take too long to process all of the queries.
4. **Memory errors.** When you are solving a problem, it is important to make sure that your code does not use too much memory. In this problem, for example, you need to make sure that your code does not create an array that is too large.

**Additional Tips:**

* When you are solving a problem, it is helpful to break it down into smaller subproblems. This can make the problem easier to understand and to solve. In this problem, for example, you could first solve the problem for the case where there are no queries. Then, you could solve the problem for the case where there is only one query. Finally, you could solve the problem for the general case.
* It is also helpful to draw a picture or diagram of the problem. This can help you to visualize the problem and to better understand the solution. In this problem, for example, you could draw a picture of the line of shops and the hungry man. This could help you to understand how the hungry man can buy meals in the shops.
* Finally, it is important to test your code thoroughly. This means testing your code with different input values and making sure that your code produces the correct output. In this problem, for example, you could test your code with different values for the array `a` and the number of queries. This could help you to catch any bugs in your code.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1492_A. Three swimmers

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input and output of this problem are integers. So we should use `int` data type to store the input and output values. If we use other data types, such as `float`, `double`, or `string`, the program may produce incorrect results.

**2. Using incorrect operators**

The problem asks us to find the minimum waiting time. So we should use the `min()` function to find the minimum value. If we use other operators, such as `>`, `<`, or `+`, the program may produce incorrect results.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The problem asks us to find the minimum waiting time. So we should find the smallest value among the waiting times of the three swimmers. If we find the largest value or the average value, the program may produce incorrect results.

**4. Not handling special cases**

The problem states that `1 ≤ p, a, b, c ≤ 10^{18}`. So we should handle the special case when one of the values is 0 or `10^{18}`. If we do not handle these special cases, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

**5. Using inefficient algorithms**

The problem can be solved in O(1) time. However, if we use an inefficient algorithm, such as a brute-force algorithm, the program may run very slowly.

CODEFORCES 213_D. Stars

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It requires a single line containing an integer n, followed by m lines containing the coordinates of the points, followed by n lines containing the indexes of the points that form the stars, and finally one line containing the numbers of points in the order in which Rubik paints them. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also very specific. It requires a single line containing an integer m, followed by m lines containing the coordinates of the points, followed by n lines containing the indexes of the points that form the stars, and finally one line containing the numbers of points in the order in which Rubik paints them. If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the length of the sides of the regular pentagons**

The length of the sides of the regular pentagons must be equal to 10. If the program does not calculate this correctly, the stars will not be drawn correctly.

**4. Incorrect calculation of the order in which Rubik paints the stars**

The order in which Rubik paints the stars must be a single move. This means that the program must paint all of the stars without lifting the pen from the paper. If the program does not paint the stars in a single move, the solution will be incorrect.

**5. Incorrect calculation of the indexes of the points that form the stars**

The indexes of the points that form the stars must be in the clockwise or counterclockwise order. If the program does not calculate these indexes correctly, the stars will not be drawn correctly.

**6. Incorrect calculation of the numbers of points in the order in which Rubik paints them**

The numbers of points in the order in which Rubik paints them must be a sequence of integers from 1 to 5n+1. If the program does not calculate these numbers correctly, the solution will be incorrect.

**7. Incorrect use of floating-point numbers**

The problem requires the use of floating-point numbers with at least 9 and at most 100 digits after the decimal point. If the program does not use floating-point numbers with the correct precision, the solution will be incorrect.

**8. Incorrect use of the validator**

The validator for this problem is very strict. It will not accept solutions that do not meet the exact specifications. If the program does not use the validator correctly, the solution will be incorrect.

CODEFORCES 237_D. T-decomposition

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not strictly defined. For example, the input `2` is not a valid input, because it doesn't specify the number of nodes in the tree.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem is also not strictly defined. For example, the output `1 2 1 2` is not a valid output, because it doesn't specify the number of nodes in the T-decomposition.
3. **Incorrect T-decomposition**. The T-decomposition must satisfy the following conditions:
    * The union of all nodes in the T-decomposition must be equal to the set of all nodes in the original tree.
    * For any edge in the original tree, there must be a corresponding edge in the T-decomposition.
    * If two nodes in the T-decomposition contain the same node in the original tree, then all nodes on the path between those two nodes in the T-decomposition must also contain the same node in the original tree.
4. **Incorrect weight of the T-decomposition**. The weight of the T-decomposition is defined as the maximum cardinality of any node in the T-decomposition. The weight of the T-decomposition must be minimized.
5. **Incorrect number of nodes in the T-decomposition**. The number of nodes in the T-decomposition must be minimized.

Here are some tips to avoid these problems:

1. Make sure that you understand the input format and output format of the problem before you start coding.
2. Carefully check your code for errors before submitting it.

CODEFORCES 472_C. Design Tutorial: Make It Nondeterministic

Pain points:
### 1. Input data format

The input data is in the following format:

```
n
f1_l f1_s
f2_l f2_s
...
fn_l fn_s
p1 p2 ... pn
```

where:

* `n` is the number of people.
* `f1_l`, `f1_s`, `f2_l`, `f2_s`, ..., `fn_l`, `fn_s` are the first and last names of the `n` people.
* `p1`, `p2`, ..., `pn` are the permutation of the people.

### 2. Output format

The output should be a single line containing either `YES` or `NO`.

### 3. Constraints

* `1 ≤ n ≤ 105`
* `1 ≤ |f_i_l|, |f_i_s| ≤ 50` for all `i` from 1 to `n`
* All of the given 2n strings will be distinct.
* `1 ≤ p_i ≤ n` for all `i` from 1 to `n`

### 4. Examples

#### Example 1

```
3
gennady korotkevich
petr mitrichev
gaoyuan chen
1 2 3

NO
```

In this example, the first person's first name is "gennady" and the last name is "korotkevich". So, if the first person uses their first name as a handle, their handle will be "gennady". However, the permutation `p` is `1 2 3`, which means that the first person's handle should be `3`. So, it is not possible to satisfy the condition `h1 < h2 < h3`.

#### Example 2

```
3
gennady korotkevich
petr mitrichev
gaoyuan chen
3 1 2

YES
```

In this example, the first person's first name is "gennady" and the last name is "korotkevich". So, if the first person uses their last name as a handle, their handle will be "korotkevich". The second person's first name is "petr" and the last name is "mitrichev". So, if the second person uses their last name as a handle, their handle will be "mitrichev". The third person's first name is "gaoyuan" and the last name is "chen". So, if the third person uses their last name as a handle, their handle will be "chen". Since `h1 < h2 < h3`, the condition is satisfied.

### 5. Possible problems and bugs

* The input data may not be valid. For example, the number of people may be negative or the names may not be strings.
* The permutation may not be valid. For example, it may contain duplicate elements or elements that are not in the range from 1 to `n`.
* The condition `h1 < h2 < h3` may not be satisfied even if the input data is valid and the permutation is valid. This can happen if the people use their first names as handles and the first names are not in alphabetical order.

### 6. Solutions

There are a few possible solutions to this problem. One solution is to sort the people by their first names and then check if the condition `h1 < h2 < h3` is satisfied. Another solution is to sort the people by their last names and then check if the condition `h1 < h2 < h3` is satisfied. Finally, you can also use a more complex algorithm to sort the people by their handles.

CODEFORCES 520_A. Pangram

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of characters in the input string.** This is a common mistake that can be easily avoided by using the `len()` function.
2. **Using the wrong character set to check for pangrams.** The pangram problem is typically solved using the 26 letters of the English alphabet. However, other character sets may be used, such as the cyrillic alphabet or the greek alphabet. It is important to make sure that the correct character set is used when checking for pangrams.
3. **Not handling all possible cases.** The pangram problem can be solved using a simple algorithm that checks for each letter of the alphabet in the input string. However, there are some special cases that need to be handled, such as letters that are repeated in the input string. It is important to make sure that all possible cases are handled correctly when solving the pangram problem.
4. **Using an inefficient algorithm.** The pangram problem can be solved using a simple algorithm that checks for each letter of the alphabet in the input string. However, there are more efficient algorithms that can be used to solve the problem. It is important to use an efficient algorithm when solving the pangram problem, as this will reduce the amount of time it takes to solve the problem.
5. **Not testing the code thoroughly.** It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly. This can be done by creating a variety of test cases and checking that the code produces the correct output for each test case.

CODEFORCES 547_C. Mike and Foam

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The most common mistake is to implement the algorithm incorrectly. This can lead to incorrect results or even a runtime error.
2. **Incorrect input format.** The input format must be strictly followed in order for the program to work correctly. Any deviation from the expected format will result in an error.
3. **Incorrect output format.** The output format must also be strictly followed in order for the program to work correctly. Any deviation from the expected format will result in an error.
4. **Memory leaks.** Memory leaks can occur when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to a decrease in performance and even a system crash.
5. **Race conditions.** Race conditions can occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even a system crash.
6. **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can lead to a system crash.
7. **Security vulnerabilities.** Security vulnerabilities can occur when a program is not properly secured. This can allow attackers to gain access to sensitive data or even take control of the system.

CODEFORCES 573_E. Bear and Bowling

Pain points:
**1. Not handling negative numbers correctly**

The problem states that the scores can be negative, but the code below does not handle negative numbers correctly. This can lead to incorrect results.

```
def main():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_score = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > 0:
            max_score += a[i] * (i + 1)
    print(max_score)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**2. Not considering all possible combinations of rolls to cancel**

The code below only considers one possible combination of rolls to cancel. This can lead to an incorrect answer.

```
def main():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_score = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            for k in range(j + 1, n):
                score = a[i] * (i + 1) + a[j] * (j + 1) + a[k] * (k + 1)
                if score > max_score:
                    max_score = score
    print(max_score)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**3. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The code below uses a brute-force algorithm to find the maximum possible score. This algorithm is not very efficient and can take a long time to run for large inputs.

```
def main():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_score = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            for k in range(j + 1, n):
                score = a[i] * (i + 1) + a[j] * (j + 1) + a[k] * (k + 1)
                if score > max_score:
                    max_score = score
    print(max_score)

if __name__ == "__main__":

Title:
CODEFORCES 595_C. Warrior and Archer

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n, and the second line should contain n distinct integers. However, it is possible for the input to be in the wrong format. For example, the input ```
1
0 1 3 7 15 31
```
is not in the correct format because the first line does not contain a single integer. If the input is in the wrong format, the program should handle the error gracefully. One way to do this is to raise an exception. For example, the following code would raise an exception if the input is in the wrong format:

```python
try:
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
except ValueError:
    raise ValueError('Incorrect input format')
```

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format specifies that the output should be a single integer. However, it is possible for the output to be in the wrong format. For example, the output ```
'123'
```
is not in the correct format because it is not a single integer. If the output is in the wrong format, the program should handle the error gracefully. One way to do this is to raise an exception. For example, the following code would raise an exception if the output is in the wrong format:

```python
try:
    print(distance)
except TypeError:
    raise TypeError('Incorrect output format')
```

**3. Incorrect data**

The problem specifies that there should be n distinct integers in the input. However, it is possible for the input to contain duplicate integers. For example, the input ```
4
0 0 1 1
```
contains two duplicate integers (0 and 1). If the input contains duplicate integers, the program should handle the error gracefully. One way to do this is to raise an exception. For example, the following code would raise an exception if the input contains duplicate integers:

```python
try:
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
except ValueError:
    raise ValueError('Duplicate integers in input')
```

**4. Incorrect logic**

The problem specifies that Vova and Lesha should take turns banning positions, and that the total number of moves should be n - 2. However, it is possible for the program to make a mistake in the logic and ban more than n - 2 positions. For example, the following code would ban 3 positions:

```python
for i in range(n - 2):
    x.pop(i)
```

If the program bans more than n - 2 positions, the output will be incorrect.

**5. Runtime error**

The program should run in a reasonable amount of time. However, it is possible for the program to run into a runtime error. For example, the following code would cause a stack overflow:

```python
while True:
    x.pop()
```

If the program runs into a runtime error, the output will be incorrect.

**6. Memory error**

The program should not use too much memory. However, it is possible for the program to use too much memory. For example, the following code would cause a memory leak:

```python
x = []
while True:
    x.append(1)
```

If the program uses too much memory, it may crash or the operating system may kill the process.
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect input format**

```
1
0 1 3 7 15 31
```

2. **Incorrect output format**

```
123
```

3. **Incorrect data**

```
4
0 0 1 1
```

4. **Incorrect logic**

```
n = int(input())
x = list(map(int, input().split()))
for i in range(n - 2):
    x.pop(i)
print(x[0] - x[1])
```

This program would ban 3 positions instead of n - 2 positions.

5. **Runtime error**

```
n = int(input())
x = list(map(int, input().split()))
while True:
    x.pop()
```

This program would cause a stack overflow.

6. **Memory error**

```
x = []
while True:
    x.append(1)
```

This program would cause a memory leak.
Title:
CODEFORCES 616_F. Expensive Strings

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the input strings.** The input strings are given as a list of strings, so it is important to make sure that the data type you are using to store them is large enough to hold all of the characters. In Python, for example, you would need to use a list of strings or a bytearray.

**2. Not handling the case where there are no occurrences of a given string in the input.** The problem statement states that the function f(s) should be maximized over all strings, even if some strings do not occur in the input. This means that you need to make sure to handle the case where there are no occurrences of a given string in the input. In Python, you can do this by checking if the length of the list of occurrences of the string is zero.

**3. Using the wrong data type for the cost of the strings.** The cost of the strings is given as a list of integers, so it is important to make sure that the data type you are using to store them is large enough to hold all of the values. In Python, for example, you would need to use a list of integers or a numpy array.

**4. Not handling the case where the cost of a string is negative.** The problem statement states that the cost of the strings can be negative, so you need to make sure to handle this case. In Python, you can do this by checking if the cost of a string is less than zero.

**5. Not handling the case where the sum of the lengths of all of the strings is greater than the maximum allowed value.** The problem statement states that the sum of the lengths of all of the strings cannot be greater than 5·105, so you need to make sure to handle this case. In Python, you can do this by checking if the sum of the lengths of all of the strings is greater than 5·105.

**6. Not using the most efficient algorithm to solve the problem.** The problem can be solved in O(n) time using a dynamic programming approach. However, there are other, more efficient algorithms that can be used to solve the problem, such as a greedy algorithm or a divide and conquer algorithm.

2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer that represents the identifier of the winning photo.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The algorithm for determining the winner photo may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not consider all of the likes, or it may not correctly identify the photo with the most likes.
4. **Runtime errors.** The algorithm may run too slowly or may not terminate at all.
5. **Memory errors.** The algorithm may use too much memory, which can lead to a crash or other problems.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific. Make sure that you are reading the input correctly and that you are not missing or adding any characters.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of buses**. The number of buses that Simion will meet is equal to the number of buses from the city B that depart in the period between Simion's departure time and his arrival time. Make sure that you are calculating this correctly.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When calculating the number of buses, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. Make sure that you are double-checking your calculations to make sure that you have not made any mistakes.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output for this problem should be a single integer. Make sure that you are formatting your output correctly.
5. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other potential bugs that could occur when solving this problem. Be sure to carefully read the problem statement and the input/output specifications to avoid any mistakes.

CODEFORCES 689_D. Friends and Subsequences

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n, but the input contains multiple integers.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the output should be a single integer, but the output contains multiple integers.
3. **Off-by-one error.** The code may incorrectly count the number of occasions that <image> is satisfied. For example, the code may count the occasion when `l = 1` and `r = n` twice, once when `l < r` and once when `r < l`.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The code may incorrectly implement the logic for determining whether <image> is satisfied. For example, the code may incorrectly compare the maximum and minimum values of the two sequences.
5. **Runtime error.** The code may run out of memory or time. For example, the code may use a recursive algorithm to solve the problem, which can quickly exhaust the stack.
6. **Incorrect data structure.** The code may use an incorrect data structure to store the two sequences. For example, the code may use a linked list to store the sequences, which can be inefficient for accessing the elements of the sequences.
7. **Incorrect algorithm.** The code may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the code may use a brute-force algorithm, which can be very inefficient.
8. **Incorrect implementation.** The code may be incorrectly implemented, even if the logic is correct. For example, the code may use incorrect variable names or make typos.

CODEFORCES 732_B. Cormen — The Best Friend Of a Man

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The input data may be of the wrong type. For example, the number of days may be a string instead of an integer. This can also cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the number of additional walks or the schedule of walks, it is easy to make a mistake and add or subtract one walk too many or too few. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program may be incorrect. For example, the program may not correctly account for the fact that Polycarp will go for a walk with Cormen on the day before the first day and on the day after the last day. This can also cause the program to produce incorrect output.
5. **Memory errors.** The program may run out of memory if the input data is too large. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
6. **Timeout errors.** The program may take too long to run if the input data is too large. This can cause the program to time out and produce no output.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format, data types, and logic of the program. It is also important to test the program with a variety of input data to ensure that it produces correct output.
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect input format.**

```

Title:
CODEFORCES 756_C. Nikita and stack

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the stack data structure.** The stack should be implemented as a LIFO (last-in, first-out) data structure, which means that the most recently added element should be the first element to be removed. This can be implemented using a linked list or an array, with the most recently added element at the end of the list or array.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the pop() operation.** The pop() operation should remove the most recently added element from the stack. This can be done by simply setting the next pointer of the most recently added element to null, or by removing the last element from the array.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the push() operation.** The push() operation should add a new element to the top of the stack. This can be done by simply adding the new element to the end of the list or array, or by creating a new node with the new element and setting its next pointer to the current top of the stack.
4. **Incorrect handling of empty stacks.** The stack should be empty when it contains no elements. This can be checked by checking if the next pointer of the top of the stack is null, or by checking if the length of the array is 0.
5. **Incorrect handling of stack overflows.** The stack should not be able to hold more elements than its maximum capacity. This can be checked by checking if the number of elements in the stack is greater than the maximum capacity.
6. **Incorrect handling of stack underflows.** The stack should not be able to pop an element when the stack is empty. This can be checked by checking if the stack is empty before calling the pop() operation.

By following these tips, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving problems involving stacks.

CODEFORCES 777_D. Cloud of Hashtags

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very strict. It is possible to submit an input with a different format, but the code will not be able to process it correctly. For example, if the input contains a hashtag with a length of 0, the code will not be able to process it correctly.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also not very strict. It is possible to submit an output with a different format, but the code will not be able to process it correctly. For example, if the output contains a hashtag with a length of 0, the code will not be able to process it correctly.

**3. Incorrect use of functions**

The code for this problem uses a number of functions. It is important to use these functions correctly. For example, if the code uses the `sort()` function incorrectly, the output will be incorrect.

**4. Incorrect use of variables**

CODEFORCES 802_B. Heidi and Library (medium)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is "n k", where `n` is the number of requests and `k` is the maximum number of books that can be borrowed at once. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to process the input and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is a single integer, which is the maximum number of books that can be borrowed at once. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will likely produce an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be correct in order to produce the correct output. If the logic is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will likely produce an incorrect answer.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program must not leak memory, or it will eventually run out of memory and crash. Memory leaks can be caused by a variety of problems, such as not freeing memory that is no longer needed, or using too much memory for temporary variables.
5. **Race conditions**. Race conditions can occur when multiple threads or processes access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even crashes. Race conditions can be avoided by using synchronization mechanisms, such as locks and mutexes.
6. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads or processes are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can lead to the threads or processes being stuck in an infinite loop, waiting for each other to release the lock. Deadlocks can be avoided by using deadlock avoidance or deadlock prevention algorithms.
7. **Unhandled exceptions**. The program must handle all exceptions that it can reasonably expect to encounter. If an exception is not handled, the program will crash. Exceptions can be handled by using try-catch blocks or by throwing exceptions.

CODEFORCES 822_D. My pretty girl Noora

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect modulo operation**

When performing modulo operations, it is important to make sure that the result is within the range of the modulo. For example, if you are using modulo 109+7, then the result of any operation must be less than or equal to 109+6. If the result is greater than 109+6, then it will be wrapped around to the beginning of the modulo range, which is 0. This can lead to incorrect results if you are not careful.

To avoid this problem, you can always check the result of your modulo operation to make sure that it is within the correct range. If it is not, you can subtract the modulo value from the result until it is within the range.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that can occur when you are working with arrays or lists. This type of error occurs when you accidentally index an element one position too high or low. For example, if you are trying to access the element at index 3 in an array, but you accidentally index it at index 4, you will get the wrong element.

Off-by-one errors can be difficult to find, because they often do not cause the program to crash. Instead, they may cause the program to produce incorrect results. To avoid off-by-one errors, you should always be careful when indexing arrays or lists.

**3. Using the wrong data type**

Another common type of bug that can occur when solving problems is using the wrong data type. For example, if you are trying to store a number that is larger than the maximum value for a particular data type, you will get an overflow error.

To avoid this problem, you should always make sure that you are using the correct data type for the values that you are storing. If you are not sure what data type to use, you can always consult the documentation for your programming language.

**4. Using uninitialized variables**

When you declare a variable, but you do not initialize it with a value, the variable will be initialized to a default value. The default value for a variable depends on the programming language that you are using. For example, in C++, the default value for an integer variable is 0, and the default value for a floating-point variable is 0.0.

Using uninitialized variables can lead to incorrect results, because you may not be aware of the value that is stored in the variable. To avoid this problem, you should always initialize your variables with a value before you use them.

**5. Forgetting to free memory**

When you allocate memory on the heap, you are responsible for freeing that memory when you are finished with it. If you forget to free the memory, it will eventually be reclaimed by the operating system, but this can lead to performance problems.

To avoid this problem, you should always make sure to free any memory that you allocate on the heap. You can do this by calling the `free()` function in C or C++.

CODEFORCES 847_I. Noise Level

Pain points:
### Possible Problems and Bugs ###

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to include a space between two numbers, the input parser will likely fail.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. When computing the noise level of a quarter, it's important to make sure that you're counting all of the sources of noise. For example, if you forget to include a source of noise that is one square away from the quarter, you'll underestimate the noise level.
3. **Incorrect array indexing**. When iterating over arrays, it's important to make sure that you're using the correct indices. For example, if you try to access an element of an array that doesn't exist, you'll get an error.
4. **Memory leaks**. When you're allocating memory for data structures, it's important to make sure that you free that memory when you're done with it. If you don't free the memory, you'll eventually run out of memory and your program will crash.
5. **Infinite loops**. If you have a bug in your code that causes an infinite loop, your program will never terminate. This can be a major problem, especially if your program is running on a server.
6. **Incorrect output format**. The output format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if you forget to put a newline character at the end of each line, the output will be incorrect.

By following these tips, you can avoid some of the most common problems and bugs that developers encounter when solving problems like this one.

CODEFORCES 869_D. The Overdosing Ubiquity

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the DFS algorithm.** The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that can be used to traverse a graph. However, it is important to implement the algorithm correctly in order to avoid errors. One common mistake is to forget to mark the nodes as visited as the algorithm progresses. This can lead to the algorithm visiting the same node multiple times, which will result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) is used to return the remainder of a division operation. This can be useful for ensuring that the output of a calculation is within a certain range. However, it is important to use the modulo operator correctly in order to avoid errors. One common mistake is to forget to use the modulo operator when calculating the number of paths in a graph. This can lead to the answer being incorrect.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** When solving a problem, it is important to consider all of the possible edge cases. For example, in the problem described above, it is important to consider the case where there are no extra edges in the graph. If this case is not handled correctly, the algorithm will not work correctly.
4. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The data structures that are used to solve a problem can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. It is important to choose the right data structures for the problem at hand. For example, in the problem described above, it is important to use a data structure that can efficiently store the edges in the graph. If the wrong data structure is used, the algorithm will not perform well.
5. **Incorrect use of mathematical formulas.** The problem described above involves calculating the number of simple paths in a graph. This can be done using a mathematical formula. However, it is important to use the formula correctly in order to avoid errors. One common mistake is to forget to account for the fact that the paths can start and end at any node in the graph. This can lead to the answer being incorrect.

CODEFORCES 992_B. Nastya Studies Informatics

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the GCD and LCM functions.** The GCD and LCM functions take two integers as input and return their greatest common divisor and least common multiple, respectively. In this problem, we need to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r and GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y. To do this, we can use the following formula:

```
number_of_good_pairs = (r - l + 1) / (x * y)
```

2. **Incorrect bounds checking.** When checking whether a pair of integers (a, b) is good, we need to make sure that both a and b are between l and r. We can do this by using the following code:

```
if (a < l || a > r || b < l || b > r):
    continue
```

3. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the number of good pairs of integers, it is important to make sure that we don't count any pairs twice. We can do this by using the following code:

```
number_of_good_pairs = (r - l + 1) - ((r - l) // x) - ((r - l) // y) + ((r - l) // (x * y))
```

4. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. In this problem, we need to use the modulo operator to make sure that the values of a and b are between 0 and y-1. We can do this by using the following code:

```
a = a % y
b = b % y

Title:
HACKEREARTH precedence-rule

Pain points:
1. The input format is not very clear. It is not clear whether the operators are separated by spaces or not.
2. The output format is not very clear. It is not clear whether the output should be rounded to the nearest integer or not.
3. The problem statement does not specify what to do if there are multiple operators of the same precedence in a row. For example, what should be the output for the expression "1 + 2 * 3 - 4 * 5"?
4. The problem statement does not specify what to do if there are parentheses in the expression. For example, what should be the output for the expression "(1 + 2) * 3 - 4 * 5"?
5. The problem statement does not specify what to do if the expression is invalid. For example, what should be the output for the expression "1 + 2 * 3 / 0"?
6. The problem statement does not specify what to do if the expression is ambiguous. For example, what should be the output for the expression "1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5"?

Title:
HACKEREARTH samu-and-shopping

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement states that Samu "won't buy the same item from the current shop if she had already bought that item from the shop adjacent to the current shop". This means that she cannot buy two shirts in a row, or two pants in a row, or two shoes in a row. However, some developers may mistakenly assume that she can buy two shirts in a row, as long as she doesn't buy two shirts in a row and a pant in between. This would lead to an incorrect solution.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution to this problem involves finding the minimum cost of buying a shirt, a pant, and a shoe from each shop, and then taking the minimum of these three costs. However, some developers may incorrectly implement the solution by finding the minimum cost of buying a shirt, a pant, and a shoe from each shop, and then adding these three costs together. This would lead to an incorrect solution.
3. **Incorrect testing of the solution.** The solution to this problem can be tested by generating a set of test cases and checking that the solution returns the correct answer for each test case. However, some developers may incorrectly test the solution by generating a set of test cases that are all very similar to each other. This would not catch any bugs in the solution.
4. **Incorrect debugging of the solution.** If the solution does not return the correct answer for a particular test case, some developers may incorrectly debug the solution by making changes to the solution that do not fix the bug. This could lead to the solution never being fixed.
5. **Incorrect documentation of the solution.** The solution to this problem should be documented in a way that makes it easy for other developers to understand how the solution works. However, some developers may incorrectly document the solution in a way that is unclear or incomplete. This could make it difficult for other developers to use the solution.

Title:
ATCODER p02623 AtCoder Beginner Contest 172 - Tsundoku

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input is given in the format of `N M K`, but the developer may mistakenly read it as `N, M, K`. This will cause the program to crash when it tries to access the `K` element of the input array.

**2. Incorrect calculation**

The developer may incorrectly calculate the number of books that can be read. For example, they may add the number of books on each desk and divide by the total time, even though the books on each desk may not be read in the same order.

**3. Off-by-one error**

The developer may incorrectly count the number of books that can be read. For example, they may forget to subtract the number of books that have already been read from the total number of books.

**4. Memory leak**

The developer may not properly free the memory that is allocated for the input array. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.

**5. Infinite loop**

The developer may write a loop that never terminates. This can happen if the loop condition is always true, or if the loop body contains a function call that never returns.

**6. Undefined behavior**

The developer may write code that results in undefined behavior. This can happen if the code accesses a memory location that is out of bounds, or if the code divides by zero.

**7. Security vulnerability**

The developer may write code that is vulnerable to security attacks. For example, they may allow users to input arbitrary data, or they may fail to properly sanitize user input.

Title:
ATCODER p02754 AtCoder Beginner Contest 158 - Count Balls

Pain points:
**1. Using floating-point numbers**

The problem states that `N`, `A`, and `B` are integers. However, the input format allows floating-point numbers. If a developer accidentally uses floating-point numbers, the program will produce incorrect results.

**2. Not handling overflow**

The problem states that `N`, `A`, and `B` can be up to `10^18`. If a developer does not handle overflow, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

**3. Not handling negative values**

The problem states that `A` and `B` must be non-negative. If a developer does not handle negative values, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

**4. Not handling the case where `N` is less than `A + B`**

The problem states that `A + B` must be less than or equal to `N`. If a developer does not handle this case, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

**5. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved in O(log N) time using a binary search. However, a developer may accidentally use a less efficient algorithm, such as a linear search. This will result in a slower program.

Title:
ATCODER p02889 AtCoder Beginner Contest 143 - Travel by Car

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly followed. For example, the number of towns and roads may not be correctly specified.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input may be incorrect. For example, the number of towns and roads may be specified as strings instead of integers.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect. For example, the program may not correctly calculate the minimum number of times the tank needs to be filled.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The program may make off-by-one errors when calculating the minimum number of times the tank needs to be filled. For example, the program may forget to add one to the number of times the tank needs to be filled.
5. **Memory leaks**. The program may leak memory. For example, the program may not correctly free the memory allocated for the data structures used to store the roads and the queries.
6. **Synchronization issues**. The program may have synchronization issues. For example, the program may not correctly protect the data structures used to store the roads and the queries from concurrent access.
7. **Race conditions**. The program may have race conditions. For example, the program may not correctly handle the case where two threads try to access the same data structure at the same time.
8. **Deadlocks**. The program may deadlock. For example, the program may have two threads that are each waiting for the other thread to release a lock.
9. **Unhandled exceptions**. The program may not correctly handle exceptions. For example, the program may not correctly handle the case where an input file cannot be opened.
10. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may have security vulnerabilities. For example, the program may allow a malicious user to gain unauthorized access to the system.

Title:
ATCODER p03024 M-SOLUTIONS Programming Contest - Sumo

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input string `S` is a string of characters, but the code may incorrectly treat it as a string of integers. This would cause the code to fail when trying to compare the number of `o` characters in `S` to 8.
2. **Incorrect logic**. The code may incorrectly check whether Takahashi can participate in the next tournament. For example, the code may check whether the number of `o` characters in `S` is greater than or equal to 8, when it should actually check whether the number of `o` characters in `S` is strictly greater than 8.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The code may incorrectly count the number of `o` characters in `S`. For example, the code may start counting from the first character in `S`, when it should actually start counting from the second character.
4. **Index out of bounds error**. The code may try to access an element of `S` that is out of bounds. For example, the code may try to access the element at index `k + 1`, when `k` is the length of `S`.
5. **Memory leak**. The code may not properly free the memory that it allocates. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
6. **Race condition**. The code may not be thread-safe. This can lead to incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.
7. **Deadlock**. The code may deadlock if two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can prevent the program from making progress.
8. **Buffer overflow**. The code may write more data to a buffer than it can hold. This can cause the program to crash or to corrupt data.
9. **Format string vulnerability**. The code may use a format string that is not properly escaped. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.
10. **SQL injection vulnerability**. The code may not properly sanitize user input before using it in a SQL statement. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL statements on the database.

Title:
ATCODER p03165 Educational DP Contest - LCS

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one errors.** When computing the longest common substring, it is important to make sure that you are comparing the correct indices in the two strings. For example, if you are comparing the strings "abc" and "abd", you need to compare "a" with "a", "b" with "b", and "c" with "d". If you accidentally compare "a" with "b", "b" with "c", and "c" with "d", you will get the wrong answer of "bcd".
2. **Incorrect use of dynamic programming.** The dynamic programming solution to the longest common substring problem involves computing a table of values that store the length of the longest common substring ending at each position in the two strings. It is important to make sure that you are computing the table correctly. For example, if you are computing the table for the strings "abc" and "abd", you need to set T[0][0] = 0, T[0][1] = 0, T[1][0] = 0, T[1][1] = 1, T[2][0] = 0, and T[2][1] = 1. If you accidentally set T[0][0] = 1, T[0][1] = 0, T[1][0] = 0, T[1][1] = 1, T[2][0] = 1, and T[2][1] = 2, you will get the wrong answer of "abcd".
3. **Incorrect use of memoization.** The memoization solution to the longest common substring problem involves storing the results of previously computed subproblems in a table. It is important to make sure that you are using the table correctly. For example, if you are computing the longest common substring of the strings "abc" and "abd", you need to first check if the table already contains the result for the subproblem of finding the longest common substring of "abc" and "ab". If it does, you can simply return the value from the table. If it does not, you need to compute the result and then store it in the table. If you accidentally compute the result and then forget to store it in the table, you will get the wrong answer.
4. **Incorrect use of bitmasks.** The bitmask solution to the longest common substring problem involves representing each string as a bitmask. It is important to make sure that you are using the bitmasks correctly. For example, if you are representing the string "abc" as the bitmask 0011, you need to represent the string "abd" as the bitmask 0111. If you accidentally represent the string "abd" as the bitmask 0010, you will get the wrong answer.
5. **Incorrect use of suffix arrays.** The suffix array solution to the longest common substring problem involves constructing a suffix array for each string. It is important to make sure that you are constructing the suffix arrays correctly. For example, if you are constructing the suffix array for the string "abc", you need to sort the suffixes of the string in lexicographic order. If you accidentally sort the suffixes in some other order, you will get the wrong answer.
6. **Incorrect use of hash tables.** The hash table solution to the longest common substring problem involves storing the occurrences of each character in each string in a hash table. It is important to make sure that you are using the hash table correctly. For example, if you are storing the occurrences of the character 'a' in the string "abc" in a hash table, you need to store the value 1 in the hash table for the key 'a'. If you accidentally store the value 0 in the hash table for the key 'a', you will get the wrong answer.
7. **Incorrect use of dynamic programming with multiple dimensions.** The dynamic programming solution to the longest common substring problem can be generalized to work with multiple dimensions. It is important to make sure that you are computing the table correctly when using multiple dimensions. For example, if you are computing the table for the strings "abc" and "abd" with two dimensions, you need to set T[0][0][0] = 0, T[0][0][1] = 0, T[0][1][0] = 0, T[0][1][1] = 1, T[1][0][0] = 0, and T[1][0][1] = 1. If you accidentally set T[0][0][0] = 1, T[0][0][1] = 0, T[

Title:
ATCODER p03307 AtCoder Beginner Contest 102 - Multiple of 2 and N

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input N can be as large as 10^9, so we need to use a data type that can store such a large number. If we use an integer type, we may get an overflow error.

**2. Not handling the case where N is even**

If N is even, the minimum positive integer divisible by both 2 and N is 2 * N. We need to make sure to handle this case correctly.

**3. Not handling the case where N is 1**

If N is 1, the minimum positive integer divisible by both 2 and N is 2. We need to make sure to handle this case correctly.

**4. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The naive algorithm for finding the minimum positive integer divisible by both 2 and N is to start with 2 and keep multiplying by 2 until we get a number that is divisible by N. This algorithm is inefficient, as it may take a long time to find the answer.

**5. Not using memoization**

The problem can be solved more efficiently using memoization. Memoization is a technique that stores the results of subproblems so that they don't have to be recomputed. This can significantly speed up the computation time.

**6. Not using a divide and conquer approach**

The problem can also be solved more efficiently using a divide and conquer approach. This approach involves recursively splitting the problem into smaller and smaller subproblems until they can be easily solved. This can also significantly speed up the computation time.

Title:
ATCODER p03467 AtCoder Grand Contest 020 - Encoding Subsets

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the encoding rules**

The encoding rules are not trivial, and it is easy to make mistakes when implementing them. For example, one common mistake is to forget that the empty string can be encoded as either `0` or `1`. Another mistake is to forget that the encoding of a string is not unique. For example, the string `001` can be encoded as either `001`, `0(1x2)`, or `(0x2)1`.

**2. Incorrect handling of boundary cases**

The input string may be empty, or it may contain only zeros or only ones. It is important to handle these cases correctly.

**3. Incorrect use of modular arithmetic**

Modular arithmetic is a powerful tool, but it is easy to make mistakes when using it. For example, one common mistake is to forget to reduce the result of an arithmetic operation modulo the modulus. Another mistake is to use the wrong modulus.

**4. Incorrect use of floating-point arithmetic**

Floating-point arithmetic is not always precise, and it is easy to make mistakes when using it. For example, one common mistake is to round a floating-point number to the wrong number of digits. Another mistake is to compare two floating-point numbers that are very close together.

**5. Incorrect use of dynamic programming**

Dynamic programming is a powerful technique for solving problems recursively. However, it is easy to make mistakes when using dynamic programming. For example, one common mistake is to forget to initialize the dynamic programming table correctly. Another mistake is to use the wrong recurrence relation.

Title:
ATCODER p03629 AtCoder Regular Contest 081 - Don't Be a Subsequence

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of comparison operators**. When comparing strings, you must use the `<` or `>` operator, not the `==` operator. For example, the following code will not work as expected:

```
if (str1 == str2) {
  // Do something
}
```

This is because the `==` operator compares two objects for equality, not for lexicographical ordering. To compare strings for lexicographical ordering, you must use the `<` or `>` operator.

2. **Incorrect use of string functions**. There are a number of string functions that can be used to manipulate strings. However, it is important to use these functions correctly. For example, the following code will not work as expected:

```
str1 = str2.substring(0, 5);
```

This is because the `substring()` function returns a substring of the string `str2`, starting at index 0 and ending at index 5. However, the variable `str1` is only initialized with the first 5 characters of `str2`. To correctly assign the entire substring to `str1`, you must use the following code:

```
str1 = str2.substring(0, str2.length());
```

3. **Incorrect use of loops**. When using loops, it is important to make sure that the loop terminates. For example, the following code will not terminate:

```
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  // Do something
}
```

This is because the loop condition will always be true, as the value of `i` will never be greater than 100. To make sure that the loop terminates, you must use a condition that will eventually become false. For example, the following code will terminate:

```
for (int i = 0; i < str1.length(); i++) {
  // Do something
}
```

4. **Incorrect use of variables**. It is important to use variables correctly. For example, the following code will not work as expected:

```
int i = 0;
i = i + 1;
```

This is because the variable `i` is being reassigned to its own value. To correctly increment the value of `i`, you must use the following code:

```
int i = 0;
i++;
```

5. **Incorrect use of functions**. It is important to use functions correctly. For example, the following code will not work as expected:

```
int sum(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}

int c = sum(1, 2);
```

This is because the function `sum()` is expecting two arguments, but only one argument is being passed. To correctly call the function, you must use the following code:

```
int c = sum(1, 2);
```

Title:
ATCODER p03787 AtCoder Grand Contest 011 - Squared Graph

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of Union Find data structure**.

Union Find data structure is a fundamental data structure used in many graph problems. It is used to find the connected components of a graph. A common implementation of Union Find data structure uses an array to store the parent of each node. The parent of a node is the node that it is connected to. To find the connected components of a graph, we start by initializing the parent of each node to itself. Then, we iterate over all the edges in the graph and union the two nodes that are connected by an edge. Once we have iterated over all the edges, each node will be in its own connected component. The number of connected components is the number of unique parents in the array.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing Union Find data structure is to incorrectly update the parent of a node when it is unioned with another node. For example, consider the following graph:

```
0 -> 1
|  / \
| /   \
2 -> 3 -> 4
```

If we implement Union Find data structure incorrectly, we might update the parent of node 2 to be node 0 when we union nodes 2 and 3. This is incorrect because node 2 is already connected to node 0. The correct way to update the parent of node 2 is to set it to be node 3.

2. **Incorrect use of Union Find data structure**.

Another common mistake that developers make when using Union Find data structure is to use it incorrectly. For example, consider the following graph:

```
0 -> 1
|  / \
| /   \
2 -> 3 -> 4
```

If we use Union Find data structure to find the connected components of this graph, we might incorrectly find that there are two connected components: {0, 1} and {2, 3, 4}. This is incorrect because node 2 is connected to node 0. The correct way to find the connected components of this graph is to first union nodes 2 and 3, and then union nodes 0 and 1. This will give us the correct connected components: {0, 1, 2, 3} and {4}.

3. **Incorrect handling of duplicate edges**.

The problem statement states that there are no self-loops and multiple edges in the graph. However, it is possible for the input to contain duplicate edges. For example, the following input contains two edges that connect nodes 0 and 1:

```
N = 2
M = 2
0 1
0 1
```

If we incorrectly handle duplicate edges, we might incorrectly find that there are two connected components: {0} and {1}. This is incorrect because nodes 0 and 1 are connected by two edges. The correct way to handle duplicate edges is to only consider each edge once.

4. **Incorrect handling of disconnected graphs**.

The problem statement states that Takahashi is constructing a new graph with N^2 vertices. However, it is possible for the input graph to be disconnected. For example, the following graph is disconnected:

```
N = 3
M = 0
```

If we incorrectly handle disconnected graphs, we might incorrectly find that there are no connected components. This is incorrect because the graph is disconnected. The correct way to handle disconnected graphs is to find the connected components of each connected component of the input graph.

5. **Incorrect handling of the output format**.

The problem statement states that the output should be the number of connected components in the graph constructed by Takahashi. However, it is possible for the developer to incorrectly output the number of connected components in the input graph. For example, the following code incorrectly outputs the number of connected components in the input graph:

```
def main():
    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    edges = []
    for _ in range(M):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        edges.append((u, v))

    uf = UnionFind(N)
    for u, v in edges:
        uf.union(u, v)

    print(uf.count())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The correct way to output the number of connected components in the graph constructed by Takahashi is to use the following code:

```
def main():
    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    edges = []
    for _ in range(M):

ATCODER p03955 AtCoder Grand Contest 006 - Rotate 3x3

Pain points:
### Possible Problems ###

1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem statement is not very clear, so it is important to read it carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked. In particular, it is important to note that the grid is 3 rows by N columns, not N rows by N columns.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution to this problem is relatively straightforward, but there are a few places where it is easy to make mistakes. For example, it is important to make sure that the subrectangle is rotated by 180 degrees, and not 90 degrees or 270 degrees.
3. **Incorrect test cases.** The test cases provided with the problem are not always sufficient to catch all possible bugs. It is important to write your own test cases to ensure that your solution is correct.
4. **Incorrect submission.** When submitting your solution, it is important to make sure that you follow the submission guidelines carefully. For example, you need to make sure that your code is formatted correctly and that you include the correct header.

### Possible Bugs ###

1. **Off-by-one errors.** It is easy to make off-by-one errors when working with arrays and indices. For example, you might accidentally index into an array one element too far or one element too few.
2. **Arithmetic errors.** It is also easy to make arithmetic errors when working with large numbers. For example, you might accidentally overflow an integer or divide by zero.
3. **Logic errors.** It is also possible to make logic errors when writing your solution. For example, you might incorrectly check if a condition is true or false.
4. **Incorrect use of functions.** It is important to make sure that you use functions correctly. For example, you might accidentally pass the wrong arguments to a function or call a function with the wrong number of arguments.
5. **Incorrect use of data structures.** It is important to make sure that you use data structures correctly. For example, you might accidentally create a data structure with the wrong size or try to access a data structure in the wrong way.

AIZU p00045 Sum and Average

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is a comma-separated pair of integers, but the developer may accidentally read it as a string. This will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The total sales amount is calculated by multiplying the unit price by the quantity. The developer may accidentally multiply the unit price by the quantity and then add the result to the total sales amount. This will cause the program to output an incorrect result.
3. **Incorrect rounding**. The average sales quantity is rounded to the first decimal place. The developer may accidentally round the average sales quantity to the nearest integer. This will cause the program to output an incorrect result.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may forget to add one to the number of unit price and quantity pairs when calculating the average sales quantity. This will cause the program to output an incorrect result.

## 4. Problem Solving

The earth is a sphere with a radius of 6,378.1 km. The surface distance between two points on the earth is the shortest distance along this sphere.

To calculate the surface distance between two cities, we can use the following formula:

```
distance = 6378.1 * arccos(sin(a) * sin(c) + cos(a) * cos(c) * cos(b - d))
```

where a, b, c, and d are the first city's north latitude, the first city's east longitude, the second city's north latitude, and the second city's east longitude, respectively.

## 5. Potential Bugs and Solutions

* **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific. Make sure that you are following the format correctly.
* **Incorrect calculation of the surface distance**. The formula for calculating the surface distance between two points on the earth is very precise. Make sure that you are using the formula correctly.
* **Rounding errors**. When rounding the surface distance to the nearest whole number, you may encounter rounding errors. Make sure that you are aware of these errors and that they do not affect your results.

## 6. Conclusion

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The variable `score` should be an integer, but it is declared as a float. This will cause the program to output incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The average score is calculated by adding the five students' scores and dividing by 5. However, the program is only adding the scores of the students who scored 40 or higher. This will cause the average score to be incorrect.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The program is supposed to output the average score of the five students, but it is actually outputting the average score of the four students who scored 40 or higher. This is because the program is not counting the student who scored 10.
4. **Index out of bounds error**. The program is trying to access the fifth element of the array `scores`, but there are only four elements in the array. This will cause the program to crash.
5. **Infinite loop**. The program is in an infinite loop because the condition in the while loop is always true. This is because the variable `i` is never incremented.

    answer = z**3 - max_x**3 - max_y**3

    # Print answer
    print(answer)
```

## Possible Problems

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is a sequence of lines, each containing one positive integer number. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output for this problem should consist of lines, each containing a single integer number. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
3. **Incorrect calculation of max(x^3 + y^3)**. The max(x^3 + y^3) is the maximum value that x^3 + y^3 can be. If the calculation of this value is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
4. **Incorrect calculation of z^3 - max(x^3 + y^3)**. The z^3 - max(x^3 + y^3) is the value that the program should print. If the calculation of this value is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

## Possible Bugs

1. **Off-by-one error**. The program may calculate the max(x^3 + y^3) or z^3 - max(x^3 + y^3) incorrectly if there is an off-by-one error.
2. **Arithmetic overflow**. The program may encounter an arithmetic overflow if the values of x, y, or z are too large.
3. **Incorrect data type**. The program may use the incorrect data type to store the values of x, y, or z. This could lead to incorrect calculations.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The program may have incorrect logic, which could lead to incorrect results.

## How to Avoid These Problems

1. Carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand the input format and output format.
2. Write unit tests to verify that your program is correctly calculating the max(x^3 + y^3) and z^3 - max(x^3 + y^3).
3. Use the appropriate data types to store the values of x, y, and z.
4. Carefully review your code for any errors in logic.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
AIZU p00963 Rendezvous on a Tetrahedron

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when writing it. For example, you might forget to put a space between two words, or you might use the wrong capitalization. This can cause the program to crash or to give incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also very specific. You need to make sure that you write the output exactly as it's specified in the problem statement. For example, you need to capitalize the word "YES" and "NO" correctly. If you don't, the program will not be able to correctly evaluate your output.

**3. Incorrect calculation of angles**

The angles in this problem are measured in degrees. It's easy to make a mistake when converting from degrees to radians, or vice versa. This can cause the program to give incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect calculation of distances**

The distances in this problem are measured in unit lengths. It's easy to make a mistake when converting from unit lengths to meters, or vice versa. This can cause the program to give incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect logic**

The logic in this problem is a bit tricky. It's easy to make a mistake when checking whether or not the two worms are on the same face of the tetrahedron. This can cause the program to give incorrect results.

**6. Incorrect error handling**

The program should handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input format is incorrect, the program should print an error message and exit. If the program encounters a divide-by-zero error, it should print an error message and exit.

**7. Incorrect testing**

It's important to test your program thoroughly before submitting it. This will help you catch any bugs that you might have missed. You should test your program with a variety of different inputs, including inputs that are valid and inputs that are invalid. You should also test your program with inputs that are likely to cause errors, such as inputs that are very large or very small.

Problem G Rendezvous on a Tetrahedron

One day, you found two worms $P$ and $Q$ crawling on the surface of a regular tetrahedron with four vertices $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$. Both worms started from the vertex $A$, went straight ahead, and stopped crawling after a while.

When a worm reached one of the edges of the tetrahedron, it moved on to the adjacent face and kept going without changing the angle to the crossed edge (Figure G.1).

Write a program which tells whether or not $P$ and $Q$ were on the same face of the tetrahedron when they stopped crawling.

You may assume that each of the worms is a point without length, area, or volume.

<image>

Figure G.1. Crossing an edge

Incidentally, lengths of the two trails the worms left on the tetrahedron were exact integral multiples of the unit length. Here, the unit length is the edge length of the tetrahedron. Each trail is more than 0:001 unit distant from any vertices, except for its start point and its neighborhood. This means that worms have crossed at least one edge. Both worms stopped at positions more than 0:001 unit distant from any of the edges.

The initial crawling direction of a worm is specified by two items: the edge $XY$ which is the first edge the worm encountered after its start, and the angle $d$ between the edge $AX$ and the direction of the worm, in degrees.

<image>

Figure G.2. Trails of the worms corresponding to Sample Input 1

Figure G.2 shows the case of Sample Input 1. In this case, $P$ went over the edge $CD$ and stopped on the face opposite to the vertex $A$, while $Q$ went over the edge $DB$ and also stopped on the same face.

Input

The input consists of a single test case, formatted as follows.


$X_PY_P$ $d_P$ $l_P$
$X_QY_Q$ $d_Q$ $l_Q$


$X_WY_W$ ($W = P,Q$) is the first edge the worm $W$ crossed after its start. $X_WY_W$ is one of BC, CD or DB.

An integer $d_W$ ($1 \leq d_W \leq 59$) is the angle in degrees between edge $AX_W$ and the initial direction of the worm $W$ on the face $\triangle AX_WY_W$.

An integer $l_W$ ($1 \leq l_W \leq 20$) is the length of the trail of worm $W$ left on the surface, in unit lengths.

Output

Output YES when and only when the two worms stopped on the same face of the tetrahedron. Otherwise, output NO.

Bugs:

2. The code does not handle the case where an operator is not defined in the dataset. This could lead to a runtime error if the input data contains an operator that is not defined.
3. The code does not handle the case where an operator has a higher precedence than all other operators. This could lead to incorrect results if the input data contains an operator with a higher precedence than all other operators.
4. The code does not handle the case where an operator has a lower precedence than all other operators. This could lead to incorrect results if the input data contains an operator with a lower precedence than all other operators.

AIZU p01984 Tanka Number

Pain points:
```
## Possible problems and bugs

1. The input format is not clear. It is not clear how to represent a tanka number.
2. The output format is not clear. It is not clear how to represent the Nth smallest tanka number.
3. The problem is not well-defined. It is not clear what constitutes a tanka number.
4. The algorithm is not efficient. It takes O(N) time to find the Nth smallest tanka number.
5. The code is not well-written. It is not easy to read and understand.

Here are some suggestions to address these problems and bugs:

1. The input format can be improved by using a more structured format. For example, the input could be a list of tanka numbers, each represented by a string of digits.
2. The output format can be improved by using a more concise format. For example, the output could be the Nth smallest tanka number as a single string of digits.
3. The problem can be better defined by providing a more specific definition of a tanka number. For example, a tanka number can be defined as a positive integer whose decimal representation consists of exactly two digits, one of which is 5 and the other is 7.
4. The algorithm can be improved by using a more efficient data structure. For example, the algorithm can use a hash table to store the tanka numbers that have already been seen.
5. The code can be improved by using more readable and concise code. For example, the code can use more descriptive variable names and comments.

Title:
AIZU p02130 Combine Two Elements

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The developer may make a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm, which will lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect input handling.** The developer may not handle the input correctly, which could lead to errors such as accessing invalid memory or crashing the program.
3. **Incorrect output handling.** The developer may not handle the output correctly, which could lead to errors such as printing incorrect results or crashing the program.
4. **Memory leaks.** The developer may not free up memory that is no longer needed, which can lead to memory leaks and eventually a crash.
5. **Race conditions.** The developer may not synchronize access to shared data correctly, which can lead to race conditions and incorrect results.
6. **Security vulnerabilities.** The developer may not implement the code securely, which could lead to security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or SQL injection attacks.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design and implement the algorithm, test the code thoroughly, and use secure coding practices.

Title:
AIZU p02271 Exhaustive Search

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type**

The input data is a sequence of integers, so the developer should use an integer data type to store the elements of the sequence. Using an incorrect data type, such as a string, could lead to incorrect results.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The brute force approach is a simple but inefficient algorithm for solving this problem. A more efficient algorithm would be to use dynamic programming.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

The developer should be careful to handle edge cases, such as the case where the sum of the elements in the sequence is less than M.

**4. Not testing the code**

The developer should always test their code to ensure that it is correct. This can be done by creating a set of test cases and running the code on them.

**5. Not using a version control system**

The developer should use a version control system to track changes to their code. This will help to prevent conflicts and ensure that the code can be easily restored if it is accidentally deleted or corrupted.

Title:
AIZU p02418 Ring

Pain points:
**1. The input may contain invalid characters.** The program should check if the input contains any characters other than lowercase letters. If it does, the program should print an error message and exit.
2. The pattern may not be found in the string.** The program should check if the pattern is found in the string. If it is not, the program should print `No`.
3. The pattern may be found multiple times in the string.** The program should only print `Yes` if the pattern is found exactly once in the string. If it is found more than once, the program should print `No`.
4. The pattern may be found in the string in reverse order.** The program should check if the pattern is found in the string in reverse order. If it is, the program should print `Yes`.
5. The pattern may be found in the string with some characters missing.** The program should check if the pattern is found in the string with some characters missing. If it is, the program should print `Yes`.
6. The pattern may be found in the string with some characters repeated.** The program should check if the pattern is found in the string with some characters repeated. If it is, the program should print `Yes`.
