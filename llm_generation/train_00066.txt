Title:
CODECHEF tashift

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data is given as two strings of the same length. However, the output is a single integer. If the developer does not correctly convert the input data to the correct data type, the program will not work correctly.

**2. Using incorrect comparison operators**

The problem states that the longest common prefix of A and B should be maximized. However, the developer may accidentally use the incorrect comparison operator, such as `<=` instead of `<`. This will result in the program incorrectly finding the longest common prefix.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The problem states that the number of shift operations should be minimized. However, the developer may accidentally use incorrect logic, such as adding the number of shift operations instead of subtracting them. This will result in the program incorrectly finding the minimum number of shift operations.

**4. Not handling all possible cases**

The problem states that the input data may contain strings of different lengths. However, the developer may accidentally only handle the case where the input data contains strings of the same length. This will result in the program incorrectly working for inputs that contain strings of different lengths.

**5. Not using efficient algorithms**

The problem can be solved in O(N) time using a simple algorithm. However, the developer may accidentally use a more complex algorithm that takes O(N^2) time or more. This will result in the program running slower than necessary.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1011_B. Planning The Expedition

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is given as two integers and a list of integers. The integers are correctly parsed, but the list of integers is parsed as a string. This can lead to errors when trying to access the elements of the list.

**2. Off-by-one error**

The problem statement says that the maximum possible number of days the expedition can last is the minimum of the number of participants and the number of food packages. However, the code incorrectly calculates the maximum number of days as the maximum of the number of participants and the number of food packages. This can lead to the incorrect answer being returned.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The code correctly calculates the maximum number of days the expedition can last, but it incorrectly prints the output. The code should print the single integer representing the maximum number of days, but it instead prints the entire list of integers. This can lead to the incorrect output being displayed.

**4. Uncaught exception**

The code does not handle the case where there are no food packages available. This can lead to an uncaught exception being thrown, which will terminate the program.

**5. Memory leak**

The code does not free the memory allocated for the list of integers. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to run out of memory.
Test inputs:
```
# 1. Incorrect data type
n, m = input().split()
n = int(n)
m = int(m)
food = list(input().split())

# 2. Off-by-one error
print(min(n, m))

# 3. Incorrect logic
print([1, 2, 3])

# 4. Uncaught exception
m = 0
food = list(input().split())

# 5. Memory leak
food = list(input().split())
```
Title:
CODEFORCES 1036_C. Classy Numbers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer T, which is the number of segments in the input. However, if the input contains fewer than T lines, or if any of the lines does not contain two integers separated by a space, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that each line should contain the number of classy integers on a segment. However, if any of the lines does not contain a single integer, or if the integer is not a positive number, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of classy integers**. The number of classy integers on a segment can be calculated by adding the number of integers with 1 digit, the number of integers with 2 digits, and the number of integers with 3 digits. However, if the program incorrectly calculates any of these numbers, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect handling of overflow**. The number of classy integers on a segment can be very large, so the program must be careful to avoid overflow errors. One way to do this is to use the `long long` data type, which can store integers up to 18 digits long.
5. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers**. The number of classy integers on a segment can be a non-integer number, so the program must be careful not to use floating-point numbers. One way to do this is to round the number of classy integers to the nearest integer.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1059_B. Forgery

Pain points:
1. The most important problem is to understand the problem. The problem is about a student who wants to forge a doctor's signature. The signature is represented as an n x m grid, where each cell is either filled with ink or empty. The student's pen can fill a 3 x 3 square without its central cell if it is completely contained inside the grid. The problem is to determine whether it is possible to forge the signature on an empty n x m grid.
2. Another possible problem is to implement the solution. The solution is to iterate over the grid and check if there is a 3 x 3 square without its central cell that is completely filled with ink. If there is such a square, then the answer is YES, otherwise the answer is NO.
3. A third possible problem is to test the solution. The solution can be tested by creating a few test cases and checking if the output is correct.
4. A fourth possible problem is to debug the solution. If the solution is not working, then it can be debugged by using a debugger or by printing out the values of the variables.
5. A fifth possible problem is to optimize the solution. The solution can be optimized by using more efficient algorithms or by removing unnecessary code.

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong formula for digital root**

The formula for digital root given in the problem statement is incorrect. The correct formula is:

```

For example, the digital root of 6543 is not 9, but 1.

**2. Not considering the case where A, B, and C are all equal**

The problem statement does not specify what to do if A, B, and C are all equal. If this happens, the algorithm proposed by Billy will incorrectly return 0.

**3. Not considering the case where A, B, and C are all multiples of 9**

CODEFORCES 1148_D. Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input data may not be valid. For example, it may contain duplicate integers, or integers that are not in the range from 1 to 2 * n.
* The output data may not be valid. For example, it may contain duplicate integers, or integers that are not in the range from 1 to n.
* The algorithm may not be correct. For example, it may not find the largest possible subset of indices that can be used to construct a good sequence.
* The algorithm may be inefficient. For example, it may take a long time to run on large inputs.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems and bugs:

* Carefully check the input data for validity.
* Make sure that the output data is valid.
* Test your algorithm on a variety of inputs to make sure that it is correct.
* Use an efficient algorithm to find the largest possible subset of indices.

Here is an example of a possible solution to this problem:

Title:
CODEFORCES 116_A. Tram

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is specified as follows:

```
The first line contains a single number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of the tram's stops.

Then n lines follow, each contains two integers ai and bi (0 ≤ ai, bi ≤ 1000) — the number of passengers that exits the tram at the i-th stop, and the number of passengers that enter the tram at the i-th stop. The stops are given from the first to the last stop in the order of tram's movement.
```

A common mistake is to forget to include the newline character at the end of each line of input. This will cause the input to be interpreted incorrectly, and the program will likely crash.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is specified as follows:

```
Print a single integer denoting the minimum possible capacity of the tram (0 is allowed).
```

A common mistake is to print the output in the wrong format. For example, printing a string instead of an integer, or printing multiple integers instead of a single integer.

3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program should be correct in order to solve the problem. A common mistake is to forget to account for all of the constraints in the problem statement. For example, the problem statement states that "the number of people inside the tram never exceeds this capacity", but the program may not correctly check this condition.

4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when the programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results.

5. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when the programmer allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash.

6. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same shared resource at the same time. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.

7. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, but neither thread can do so. This can cause the program to run indefinitely or crash.

8. **Buffer overflows**. Buffer overflows occur when a program writes data to a buffer that is not large enough to hold the data. This can cause the program to overwrite adjacent memory locations, which can lead to security vulnerabilities or crashes.

9. **Format string vulnerabilities**. Format string vulnerabilities occur when a program uses a format string that is not properly sanitized. This can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the program, which can lead to security vulnerabilities or crashes.

10. **SQL injection vulnerabilities**. SQL injection vulnerabilities occur when a program passes user input directly to an SQL statement without properly sanitizing it. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the server, which can lead to data breaches or denial-of-service attacks.

CODEFORCES 1188_A1. Add on a Tree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrectly handling the input data.** The input data may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers that are too large. The developer should make sure to check the input data for validity and handle any errors appropriately.
2. **Incorrectly implementing the algorithm.** The algorithm for solving this problem is relatively straightforward, but there are a few common mistakes that developers make. For example, the developer may forget to update the values of the edges after each operation, or they may not correctly handle the case where the tree has multiple leaves.
3. **Not handling all possible cases.** The problem statement specifies that the tree must have at least two nodes. However, the developer may forget to check this condition and assume that the tree always has at least two nodes. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Using inefficient algorithms.** The algorithm for solving this problem can be implemented in a variety of ways. However, some algorithms are more efficient than others. The developer should choose an algorithm that is appropriate for the problem size and the constraints on the runtime.
5. **Not testing the code thoroughly.** It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and that it handles all possible cases. The developer should create a variety of test cases, including cases with invalid input data, cases with multiple leaves, and cases where the tree has a special structure.

By following these tips, developers can avoid common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1249_D2. Too Many Segments (hard version)

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data contains a lot of integers. If we use an incorrect data type, such as `int`, to store the integers, it may cause overflow. For example, if we use `int` to store the number of segments `n`, and `n` is a large number, such as `2 * 10^5`, then `n` will be stored as `2147483647`, which is less than the actual value of `n`. This will lead to incorrect results.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The problem is to find the minimum number of segments to remove so that there are no bad points at all. A naive algorithm is to iterate through all the segments and remove the segments that cover more than `k` points. However, this algorithm is too slow. A better algorithm is to use a data structure called a segment tree. A segment tree can be used to quickly find the segments that cover a given point. With a segment tree, we can find the minimum number of segments to remove in O(n log n) time.

**3. Not handling corner cases**

The problem statement mentions a few corner cases, such as when `k` is 1 or when all the segments are the same. We need to make sure to handle these corner cases correctly.

**4. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it. This will help you to catch bugs and errors. You can test your code on a few small test cases, as well as on the sample input and output.

**5. Not using a debugger**

If you are having trouble debugging your code, you can use a debugger to help you. A debugger can help you to track down the source of errors in your code.

**6. Not asking for help**

If you are stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help. There are many resources available online, such as forums, blogs, and Stack Overflow. You can also ask for help from friends or family.
Test inputs:

CODEFORCES 1268_A. Long Beautiful Integer

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain two integers n and k, and the second line should contain n digits. However, if the input format is not correct, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of digits in y.** The number of digits in y is equal to n - k + 1. However, if the calculation is incorrect, the program may produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the digits in y.** The digits in y are equal to the digits in x, except for the last k digits, which are all equal to the first digit in x. However, if the calculation is incorrect, the program may produce incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The input may contain edge cases, such as n = k or x = 0. The program must be able to handle these edge cases correctly.
5. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The program must use data structures efficiently to store and process the input data. If the data structures are not used correctly, the program may run slowly or produce incorrect output.
6. **Incorrect error handling.** The program must be able to handle errors gracefully. If an error occurs, the program should print an error message and exit.
7. **Incorrect unit testing.** The program must be unit tested to ensure that it is correct. If the unit tests are not comprehensive, the program may contain bugs that are not caught by the tests.
8. **Incorrect integration testing.** The program must be integration tested to ensure that it works correctly with other parts of the system. If the integration tests are not comprehensive, the program may contain bugs that are not caught by the tests.
9. **Incorrect system testing.** The program must be system tested to ensure that it works correctly in a production environment. If the system tests are not comprehensive, the program may contain bugs that are not caught by the tests.

**Possible Problems**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** This is the most common problem that developers encounter when solving problems. It is important to carefully read the problem statement and make sure that your implementation is correct.
2. **Incorrect input/output format.** Make sure that your input and output are in the correct format. The problem statement will usually specify the format of the input and output.
3. **Memory limit exceeded.** This can happen if your program uses too much memory. Make sure that your program is as efficient as possible.
4. **Time limit exceeded.** This can happen if your program takes too long to run. Make sure that your program is as efficient as possible.
5. **Wrong answer.** This can happen if your program does not produce the correct output. Make sure that your program is correct.

**Possible Bugs**

1. **Off-by-one errors.** These are common errors that occur when the developer forgets to account for the first or last element in an array or list.
2. **Indexing errors.** These are errors that occur when the developer uses an invalid index to access an element in an array or list.
3. **Arithmetic errors.** These are errors that occur when the developer makes a mistake in a mathematical calculation.
4. **Logical errors.** These are errors that occur when the developer makes a mistake in the logic of their program.
5. **Typos.** These are errors that occur when the developer mistypes a word or character in their code.

CODEFORCES 1310_C. Au Pont Rouge

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake and provide incorrect input. For example, if you forget to put a space between the numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of possible arrangements**. The number of possible arrangements of m meeting rooms in a string of length n is given by the following formula:

```
n! / (m! * (n - m)!)
```

However, it is easy to make a mistake in the calculation, especially if n and m are large.
3. **Incorrect sorting of the labels**. The labels should be sorted backward lexicographically. This means that the label with the smallest name should come first, followed by the label with the second smallest name, and so on. It is easy to make a mistake in the sorting algorithm, especially if the labels are long.
4. **Incorrect output**. The output should be a single string, which is the name of the meeting room printed on the k-th label of the delivery. It is easy to make a mistake in the output, especially if the meeting room name is long.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand the input format and the output format. It is also important to double-check your calculations and your sorting algorithm. Finally, it is important to test your code on a few small examples before submitting it to the judge.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1373_C. Pluses and Minuses

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type**

The problem states that the length of the input string can be up to 10^6, so we need to use a data type that can store integers of that size. If we use an incorrect data type, such as an integer, we may get a runtime error when the program tries to store a value that is too large.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1396_B. Stoned Game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem states that "T and HL will take alternating turns, with T going first". However, some developers may mistakenly assume that T and HL take turns simultaneously. This can lead to incorrect solutions.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the game logic.** The game logic is fairly simple, but it is easy to make mistakes when implementing it. For example, some developers may forget to check if a pile is empty before removing a stone from it. This can lead to incorrect solutions.
3. **Incorrect handling of corner cases.** The problem specifies a few corner cases, such as the case where there is only one pile of stones. Some developers may forget to handle these corner cases correctly, which can lead to incorrect solutions.
4. **Incorrect testing.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. Some developers may only test their solution on a few small test cases, which is not enough to ensure that it is correct.
5. **Incorrect debugging.** If your solution is not correct, it is important to be able to debug it effectively. Some developers may not know how to debug their code effectively, which can make it difficult to find and fix errors.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1438_D. Powerful Ksenia

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be "n\n[a1, a2, ..., an]". For example, if n = 5, a1 = 4, a2 = 2, a3 = 1, a4 = 7, a5 = 2, the input should be "5\n4 2 1 7 2".
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be "YES" or "NO" in the first line. If it is possible to make all elements equal in at most n operations, print an integer m (0 ≤ m ≤ n), which denotes the number of operations you do. In each of the next m lines, print three distinct integers i, j, k, representing one operation. 
3. **Mathematical errors**. For example, if the input is "5\n4 2 1 7 2", the output should be "YES". However, if the output is "NO", it is incorrect.
4. **Algorithmic errors**. For example, if the input is "5\n4 2 1 7 2", the algorithm should first find the XOR of all elements in the array. Then, it should iterate through all possible triples of indices (i, j, k) and check if the XOR of a_i, a_j, a_k is equal to the XOR of all elements in the array. If it is, the algorithm should print "YES" and the number of operations. Otherwise, it should print "NO".

Title:
CODEFORCES 1463_C. Busy Robot

Pain points:
**Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs:**

1. **Off-by-one errors.** This is a common problem when working with arrays and indices. Make sure that you are always checking the correct index, and that you are not accidentally skipping or repeating elements.
2. **Incorrect boundary conditions.** Be careful when dealing with the edges of arrays. Make sure that you are not trying to access elements that are out of bounds.
3. **Incorrect data types.** Make sure that you are using the correct data types for your variables. For example, if you are storing a number of seconds, you should use an `int` or `long` type, not a `float` or `double`.
4. **Logic errors.** This is a general category that includes any errors in your code that cause it to produce incorrect results. Be careful to check your logic carefully and make sure that it is correct.
5. **Off-by-two errors.** This is a specific type of off-by-one error that can occur when you are working with arrays. Make sure that you are always adding or subtracting two elements, not just one.
6. **Indexing errors.** This is a common problem when working with arrays. Make sure that you are indexing the array correctly, and that you are not accidentally accessing elements that are out of bounds.
7. **Null pointer exceptions.** This is a type of exception that occurs when you try to access a null pointer. Make sure that you are always checking for null pointers before you dereference them.
8. **Memory leaks.** This is a type of error that occurs when you allocate memory but do not free it when you are finished with it. This can lead to your program running out of memory and crashing.
9. **Race conditions.** This is a type of error that occurs when two or more threads try to access the same shared resource at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even a deadlock.
10. **Deadlocks.** This is a type of error that occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, but neither thread can do so. This can lead to your program being stuck in an infinite loop.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1512_A. Spy Detected!

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type for the array.** The input array is of type `int`, but the developer may accidentally use a different data type, such as `float` or `string`, which could lead to incorrect results.
2. **Not using a loop to iterate through the array.** The developer may try to solve the problem by simply comparing the first element of the array to all of the other elements, but this will not work if the array is not sorted.
3. **Using an incorrect comparison operator.** The developer may accidentally use the `==` operator instead of the `!=` operator, which will lead to the wrong answer.
4. **Not handling the case where the array is empty.** The developer should check if the array is empty before trying to iterate through it, or they may get a `NullPointerException`.
5. **Not handling the case where all of the elements in the array are the same.** The developer should return `-1` in this case, as there is no element that does not equal the others.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use the correct data type for the array.
* Use a loop to iterate through the array.
* Use the `!=` operator to compare the elements of the array.
* Handle the case where the array is empty.
* Handle the case where all of the elements in the array are the same.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1539_E. Game with Cards

Pain points:
**1. Input Format**

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9) — the number of questions and the maximum possible value on the card.

Then n queries are described. Every description contains 3 lines.

The first line of the description of the i-th query contains a single integer k_i (0 ≤ k_i ≤ m) — the number on a new card.

The second line of the description of the i-th query contains two integers a_{l, i} and b_{l, i} (0 ≤ a_{l, i} ≤ b_{l, i} ≤ m) — the minimum and maximum values of the card at the left hand after the replacement.

The third line of the description of the i-th query contains two integers a_{r, i} and b_{r,i} (0 ≤ a_{r, i} ≤ b_{r,i} ≤ m) — the minimum and maximum values of the card at the right hand after the replacement.

**2. Output Format**

At the first line, print "Yes", if Bob can answer all queries, and "No" otherwise.

If Bob can answer all n queries, then at the second line print n numbers: a way to satisfy all requirements. If in i-th query Bob needs to replace the card in the left hand, print 0, otherwise print 1. If there are multiple answers, print any.

**3. Constraints**

2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000
2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9
0 ≤ a_{l, i} ≤ b_{l, i} ≤ m
0 ≤ a_{r, i} ≤ b_{r,i} ≤ m

**4. Examples**

**Example 1**

```
Input

2 10
3
0 3
0 2
2
0 4
0 2

Output

Yes
0 1
```

**Explanation**

In the first query, Bob can replace the card in the left hand with 3, and the resulting values of the cards in the left and right hands will be 3 and 2, respectively, which satisfy the constraints.

In the second query, Bob can replace the card in the right hand with 4, and the resulting values of the cards in the left and right hands will be 3 and 4, respectively, which satisfy the constraints.

**Example 2**

```
Input

2 10
3
0 3
0 2
2
3 4
0 1

Output

No
```

**Explanation**

In the first query, Bob can replace the card in the left hand with 3, and the resulting values of the cards in the left and right hands will be 3 and 2, respectively, which satisfy the constraints.

In the second query, Bob cannot replace any card, because no matter which card he replaces, the resulting values of the cards in the left and right hands will not satisfy the constraints.

Title:
CODEFORCES 166_B. Polygons

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly and that you are not missing any of the required information. For example, if you forget to read the number of vertices in polygon A, your program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem must be a single string, either "YES" or "NO". Make sure that you are not printing any extra characters or spaces.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The most important part of solving this problem is to correctly determine whether or not polygon B is strictly inside polygon A. This can be a tricky problem, so it is important to be careful and to think carefully about your solution.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

It is very easy to make off-by-one errors when programming, especially when you are working with arrays or lists. Make sure that you are carefully checking your code for these types of errors.

**5. Runtime errors**

Your program should be able to run within the time limit specified by the problem. If your program is running too slowly, you may need to optimize your code or use a different algorithm.

Title:
CODEFORCES 187_C. Weak Memory

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of vertices is not a positive integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values must be correct. For example, if the number of vertices is a string, the program will crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. These errors occur when the programmer forgets to add or subtract one from a value. For example, if the program is supposed to find the minimum value of a set of numbers, but the programmer forgets to subtract one from each number, the minimum value will be incorrect.
4. **Infinite loops**. These errors occur when the program enters a loop that never terminates. For example, if the program is supposed to print the numbers from 1 to 10, but the programmer forgets to add a break statement to the loop, the program will print the numbers forever.
5. **Memory leaks**. These errors occur when the program allocates memory that is never freed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions**. These errors occur when two or more parts of the program try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
7. **Deadlocks**. These errors occur when two or more parts of the program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can ever finish. This can also lead to the program crashing.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. These errors occur when the program allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system. For example, if the program allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the system, the attacker could take control of the system.
9. **User errors**. These errors occur when the user does something wrong, such as entering invalid input or clicking on the wrong button. The program should be designed to handle these errors gracefully.
10. **System errors**. These errors occur when the system is not working properly. For example, if the system runs out of memory, the program will crash. The program should be designed to handle these errors gracefully.

Title:
CODEFORCES 233_D. Table

Pain points:
**1. Using the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++.**

This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The %lld specifier is only supported by some compilers, and even when it is supported, it may not produce the correct results. It is best to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier instead.

**2. Not considering the edge cases.**

The problem statement specifies that the number of rows and columns of the table must be at least 1, and the number of points each square must contain must be at least 0. However, it is possible for a user to input values that do not meet these requirements. For example, a user could input n = 0, m = 0, or k = 0. If the developer does not handle these edge cases correctly, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

**3. Not using the correct data types.**

The problem statement specifies that the number of rows and columns of the table, the number of points each square must contain, and the number of ways to fill the table with points are all integers. However, it is possible for a user to input values that are not integers. For example, a user could input n = 1.5, m = 2.5, or k = 3.5. If the developer does not use the correct data types, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

**4. Not using the correct algorithm.**

The problem statement asks for the number of ways to fill the table with points, provided that each square subtable of size n × n has exactly k points. There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. The most efficient algorithm is the inclusion-exclusion principle. However, this algorithm can be difficult to implement correctly. A simpler algorithm that is also correct is to count the number of ways to fill the table with points, and then subtract the number of ways to fill the table with too many points or too few points.

**5. Not handling overflow errors.**

The number of ways to fill the table with points can be very large. If the developer does not handle overflow errors correctly, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++.
* Consider all of the edge cases.
* Use the correct data types.
* Use the correct algorithm.
* Handle overflow errors correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 259_C. Little Elephant and Bits

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a single line containing an integer written in binary without leading zeroes. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to parse the input and will either crash or output incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single line containing the maximum number that can be obtained by deleting exactly one binary digit from the input number. The output should be written in binary without leading zeroes. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to output the correct answer and will either crash or output incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The program must find the maximum number that can be obtained by deleting exactly one binary digit from the input number. The program must do this by iterating through all possible binary digits that can be deleted from the input number and finding the one that results in the largest maximum number. If the program's logic is incorrect, it will not be able to find the correct answer and will either crash or output incorrect results.
4. **Memory leaks.** The program must not allocate any memory that it does not need. If the program allocates memory that it does not need, it will eventually run out of memory and crash.
5. **Race conditions.** The program must not access shared resources without first acquiring a lock. If the program accesses shared resources without first acquiring a lock, it may cause other threads to crash or produce incorrect results.
6. **Synchronization errors.** The program must ensure that all threads are synchronized before accessing shared resources. If the program does not synchronize threads, it may cause other threads to crash or produce incorrect results.
7. **Deadlocks.** The program must not deadlock. If the program deadlocks, it will not be able to continue execution and will eventually crash.
8. **Unhandled exceptions.** The program must handle all exceptions that it can. If the program does not handle an exception, it will crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 305_B. Continued Fractions

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to put a space between the two integers in the first line, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The continued fraction expansion of a rational number is not always unique, so it is important to make sure that you are using the correct expansion when comparing two fractions. For example, the continued fraction expansion of 1/2 is either 0/1 + 1/1 or 1/2 + 0/1, and the two expansions are not equivalent.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When comparing two fractions, it is important to make sure that you are comparing the numerators and denominators correctly. For example, if you compare 1/2 to 1/3, you will get the wrong answer because 1/2 is not equal to 1/3.
4. **Floating-point errors**. When working with floating-point numbers, it is important to be aware of the fact that they are not exact representations of real numbers. This can lead to errors when comparing two fractions, especially if the fractions are very close together.
5. **Infinite loops**. If you are not careful, your program could enter an infinite loop when trying to compare two fractions. This can happen if you have a division by zero error, or if you have a loop that never terminates.
6. **Memory errors**. If your program is not careful about how it allocates and frees memory, it could run out of memory and crash. This is especially likely to happen if you are working with large fractions.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. If your program is not careful about how it validates user input, it could be vulnerable to attack. For example, if you allow a user to input the numerator and denominator of a fraction, you could be vulnerable to a division by zero attack.

Title:
CODEFORCES 448_C. Painting Fence

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not clear.**

The problem states that the first line contains the number of planks, n, and the second line contains the heights of the planks, a1, a2, ..., an. However, the example input does not match this format. The first line of the example input contains the number of planks, n, but the second line contains the heights of the planks, a1, a2, ..., an, followed by an extra integer, 5. This could cause confusion for developers who are not familiar with the problem statement.

**2. The output format is not clear.**

The problem states that the output should be a single integer, the minimum number of strokes needed to paint the whole fence. However, the example output does not match this format. The example output contains three integers, 3, 2, and 1. This could cause confusion for developers who are not familiar with the problem statement.

**3. The problem is not well-defined.**

The problem does not specify what happens if the brush's full surface does not touch the fence at all times. For example, what if the brush is only 1 meter wide and the fence is 2 meters wide? In this case, the brush would not be able to paint the entire fence in a single stroke. The problem should specify what happens in this case.

**4. The problem is too difficult.**

The problem requires the developer to come up with an algorithm to find the minimum number of strokes needed to paint the whole fence. This could be a difficult problem for developers who are not familiar with algorithms.

**5. The problem is not interesting.**

The problem does not require the developer to use any creativity or problem-solving skills. The developer can simply follow a simple algorithm to solve the problem. This could make the problem boring for developers who are looking for a challenge.

Title:
CODEFORCES 492_E. Vanya and Field

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly, and that you are not accidentally skipping or misparsing any of the values.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be two space-separated integers, which represent the coordinates of the cell from which Vanya should start his path. Make sure that you are formatting your output correctly, and that you are not accidentally including any extra spaces or characters.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When dealing with arrays and matrices, it is easy to make off-by-one errors. For example, you might accidentally index an array one element too low or too high. This can lead to incorrect results, so it is important to be careful when working with arrays and matrices.

**4. Undefined behavior**

Undefined behavior occurs when a program does something that is not specified in the language standard. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as dividing by zero or accessing a memory location that is out of bounds. Undefined behavior can lead to unpredictable results, so it is important to avoid it whenever possible.

**5. Memory leaks**

A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory, which can cause it to crash. It is important to be careful when allocating and freeing memory, and to make sure that you are freeing all of the memory that you allocate.

**6. Race conditions**

A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results, or even to the program crashing. It is important to avoid race conditions whenever possible, by using synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes and semaphores.

**7. Deadlocks**

A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are each waiting for the other to release a lock. This can prevent any of the threads from making progress, and can eventually cause the program to crash. It is important to avoid deadlocks whenever possible, by using careful locking and unlocking strategies.

**8. Buffer overflows**

A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold. This can lead to the program overwriting adjacent memory locations, which can lead to incorrect results or even to the program crashing. It is important to be careful when writing to buffers, and to make sure that you do not write more data than the buffer can hold.

CODEFORCES 516_D. Drazil and Morning Exercise

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not always followed correctly. For example, the input may contain a line with more than three integers, or a line with less than three integers, or a line with non-integer values. The developer should check the input format and handle errors accordingly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem is not always followed correctly. For example, the output may contain a line with more than one integer, or a line with less than one integer, or a line with non-integer values. The developer should check the output format and handle errors accordingly.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The developer may make a mistake in the calculation of the answer. For example, the developer may forget to add or subtract a term, or the developer may use the wrong formula. The developer should carefully check the calculation and make sure that the answer is correct.
4. **Memory leak**. The developer may allocate memory that is never freed. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash. The developer should use the `delete` keyword to free memory that is no longer needed.
5. **Synchronization issues**. The developer may use multiple threads to access shared data without proper synchronization. This can lead to data corruption and other problems. The developer should use locks or other synchronization mechanisms to ensure that only one thread can access shared data at a time.
6. **Race conditions**. The developer may create a race condition, which is a situation where two or more threads can access shared data at the same time and the outcome of the program depends on the order in which the threads execute. The developer should avoid race conditions by using locks or other synchronization mechanisms.
7. **Deadlocks**. The developer may create a deadlock, which is a situation where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, and none of the threads can proceed. The developer should avoid deadlocks by using locks or other synchronization mechanisms.
8. **Buffer overflows**. The developer may write data to a buffer that is not large enough to hold the data. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can eventually cause the program to crash. The developer should use the `strlen` function to determine the length of a string before writing it to a buffer.
9. **Format string vulnerabilities**. The developer may use a format string that is not properly escaped. This can lead to a format string vulnerability, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system. The developer should use the `strftime` function to format strings safely.
10. **SQL injection vulnerabilities**. The developer may not properly sanitize user input before using it in a SQL query. This can lead to a SQL injection vulnerability, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database. The developer should use the `mysqli_real_escape_string` function to sanitize user input.

CODEFORCES 633_B. A Trivial Problem

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong formula for the number of trailing zeroes in a factorial.** The formula for the number of trailing zeroes in a factorial is `n / 5`, where `n` is the factorial. However, some developers mistakenly use the formula `n / 2`, which will result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Not considering the case where `m` is greater than the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n`.** In this case, there will be no integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` zeroes.
3. **Not handling the case where `m` is zero.** In this case, the answer is simply `1`, since the factorial of any number ends with at least one zero.
4. **Using an incorrect algorithm to find the integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` zeroes.** There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem, but some algorithms are more efficient than others.
5. **Not handling errors correctly.** It is important to handle errors correctly, such as when the input is invalid or when the program runs out of memory.

CODEFORCES 708_D. Incorrect Flow

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

1. The input may contain invalid data. For example, the number of nodes or edges may be negative or zero, or the capacity or flow value may be negative.
2. The input may not represent a valid directed graph. For example, there may be an edge that goes from a node to itself, or there may be two edges that go from the same node to the same other node.
3. The input may not represent a valid flow. For example, the sum of the flows of all edges going into a node may not be equal to the sum of the flows of all edges going out of the node.
4. The input may not represent a flow that is minimum possible. For example, there may be a way to reduce the total change of the functions f(e) and c(e) by making some changes to the flow.

**How to avoid these problems and bugs:**

1. Validate the input data before you start processing it. This will help you to catch any errors early on and prevent them from causing problems later.
2. Use a data structure that is appropriate for representing a directed graph. For example, you could use a hash table to store the edges of the graph, where the key is the pair of nodes that the edge connects and the value is the weight of the edge.
3. Use a data structure that is appropriate for representing a flow. For example, you could use a matrix to store the flow values of all of the edges in the graph.
4. Use a greedy algorithm to find a minimum possible flow. This will help you to find a flow that is close to the optimal solution without having to search through all of the possible solutions.

CODEFORCES 750_G. New Year and Binary Tree Paths

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the binary tree traversal algorithm.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. The binary tree traversal algorithm is a recursive algorithm that visits each node in the tree in a specific order. If the implementation of this algorithm is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the sum of the indices of the nodes on the path.** Another common mistake that developers make is to incorrectly calculate the sum of the indices of the nodes on the path. This can be caused by a number of factors, such as using the wrong formula or using incorrect values for the indices of the nodes.

**3. Incorrect handling of boundary conditions.** The binary tree traversal algorithm can be tricky to implement correctly, especially when it comes to handling boundary conditions. For example, if the tree is empty, the algorithm should not visit any nodes. Similarly, if the tree only has one node, the algorithm should only visit that node.

**4. Incorrect use of data structures.** The binary tree traversal algorithm can be implemented using a variety of data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, and trees. If the wrong data structure is used, it can lead to incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect error handling.** The binary tree traversal algorithm can throw a number of errors, such as a `NullPointerException` or a `IndexOutOfBoundsException`. If these errors are not handled correctly, it can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.

**6. Incorrect testing.** The best way to avoid bugs in your code is to test it thoroughly. This means testing for a variety of input conditions, including boundary conditions, invalid inputs, and unexpected errors. By testing your code thoroughly, you can catch bugs early and prevent them from causing problems in production.

Title:
CODEFORCES 774_E. Big Number and Remainder

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type**

The input integer can be very large, so it's important to use a data type that can store it without overflowing. In Python, you can use the `int` type for integers up to 2**31-1, or the `long` type for integers up to 2**63-1.

**2. Not considering all good shifts**

The problem statement says that we need to consider all cyclic shifts of Stepan's integer. This means that we need to consider all possible ways of shifting the digits of the integer to the left or to the right. If we don't consider all possible shifts, we may not find the minimum remainder.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The naive algorithm for finding the minimum remainder would be to iterate over all possible good shifts and calculate the remainder of each shift by m. This algorithm would have a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the length of the input integer.

A more efficient algorithm would be to use the following property: the remainder of a cyclic shift of an integer by k is the same as the remainder of the integer by m*k. This means that we can find the minimum remainder by simply dividing the input integer by m and taking the remainder.

**4. Rounding errors**

When dividing a large integer by a small integer, we may get rounding errors. This can cause the minimum remainder to be incorrect. To avoid this, we can use the following technique:

1. Divide the input integer by m, rounding down to the nearest integer.
2. Calculate the remainder of the division by m.
3. If the remainder is greater than m/2, subtract m from it.

This technique will ensure that the minimum remainder is always correct.

**5. Incorrect output format**

The output should be a single integer, which is the minimum remainder of the division by m. Make sure to format the output correctly.
Test inputs:
**1. Using an incorrect data type**

```
input_int = int(input())
```

**2. Not considering all good shifts**

```
input_str = input()

for i in range(len(input_str)):
    shifted_str = input_str[i:] + input_str[:i]
    if shifted_str.isdigit():
        print(int(shifted_str) % m)
```

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

```
input_int = int(input())
m = int(input())

remainder = input_int % m

while remainder > m / 2:
    remainder -= m

print(remainder)
```

**4. Rounding errors**

```
input_int = int(input())
m = int(input())

rounded_int = input_int // m
remainder = input_int % m

if remainder > m / 2:
    remainder -= m

print(remainder)
```

**5. Incorrect output format**

```
input_int = int(input())
m = int(input())

remainder = input_int % m

print(str(remainder))
```
Title:
CODEFORCES 799_E. Aquarium decoration

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values may not be correct, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program may crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the program does not account for the fact that the first element of an array is at index 0, not index 1. For example, if the program is supposed to iterate over an array of size 5, but it starts at index 1, it will skip the first element of the array.
4. **Index out of bounds errors**. Index out of bounds errors occur when the program tries to access an element of an array that does not exist. For example, if the program tries to access the element at index 5 of an array of size 4, it will cause an index out of bounds error.
5. **Null pointer exceptions**. Null pointer exceptions occur when the program tries to access a variable that has not been initialized. For example, if the program tries to print the value of a variable that has not been assigned a value, it will cause a null pointer exception.
6. **Arithmetic errors**. Arithmetic errors occur when the program performs an arithmetic operation that results in an incorrect value. For example, if the program divides two numbers and the result is not a whole number, it will cause an arithmetic error.
7. **Logic errors**. Logic errors occur when the program does not perform the correct operations in the correct order. For example, if the program is supposed to find the minimum value in an array, but it instead finds the maximum value, it will cause a logic error.
8. **Runtime errors**. Runtime errors occur when the program encounters a problem that it cannot handle. For example, if the program runs out of memory, it will cause a runtime error.
9. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities occur when the program allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system. For example, if the program does not properly sanitize user input, it could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the system.

Title:
CODEFORCES 819_E. Mister B and Flight to the Moon

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format specifies that the only line should contain a single integer n. If the input contains multiple lines, or if the input does not contain a single integer, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format specifies that the first line should contain the number of cycles k, followed by k lines, each of which describes a cycle. If the output does not follow this format, the program will not be able to correctly parse the output and will produce incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect solution**

The solution to this problem requires finding a way to cover the complete graph with cycles of length 3 and 4 so that each edge is in exactly two cycles. If the solution does not satisfy this requirement, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem and will produce incorrect results.

**4. Runtime errors**

The program may encounter runtime errors if it is not properly optimized. For example, the program may use an inefficient algorithm to find a solution to the problem, or it may allocate too much memory. These runtime errors can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect results.

**5. Logical errors**

The program may contain logical errors that cause it to produce incorrect results. For example, the program may incorrectly check whether a cycle is valid, or it may incorrectly count the number of cycles in the solution. These logical errors can cause the program to produce incorrect results, even if the program is otherwise correct.

CODEFORCES 845_C. Two TVs

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly specified. For example, the input may contain a string instead of an integer. The developer should check the input format and raise an error if it is incorrect.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correctly specified. For example, the output may contain a space instead of a newline. The developer should check the output format and raise an error if it is incorrect.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program. For example, the developer may forget to check if the two TVs are available at the same time. The developer should carefully check the logic of the program to ensure that it is correct.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer may not release memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash. The developer should use a garbage collector or manually release memory that is no longer needed.
5. **Synchronization issues**. The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data. This can lead to race conditions, which can cause the program to produce incorrect results. The developer should use locks or other synchronization mechanisms to ensure that only one thread can access shared data at a time.
6. **Deadlocks**. The developer may create a deadlock, which is a situation where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely. The developer should carefully design the program to avoid deadlocks.

Title:
CODEFORCES 891_E. Lust

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always followed correctly. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. This can cause the program to crash or to output incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect variable initialization.** The variables used in the program must be initialized correctly. For example, if a variable is initialized to a value that is not within its valid range, the program may crash or output incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program must be correct. For example, if the program does not correctly calculate the expected value of `res`, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors occur when the programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can cause the program to output incorrect results.
5. **Arithmetic errors.** Arithmetic errors occur when the programmer makes a mistake in performing arithmetic operations. This can cause the program to output incorrect results.
6. **Memory errors.** Memory errors occur when the programmer allocates too much or too little memory for a variable. This can cause the program to crash or to output incorrect results.
7. **Race conditions.** Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to crash or to output incorrect results.
8. **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can cause the program to crash or to output incorrect results.
9. **Buffer overflows.** Buffer overflows occur when a program writes data to a buffer that is too small. This can cause the program to crash or to output incorrect results.
10. **Format string vulnerabilities.** Format string vulnerabilities occur when a program uses a format string incorrectly. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

CODEFORCES 913_H. Don't Exceed

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The most common mistake is to make a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm. This can lead to incorrect results or even a runtime error.
2. **Incorrect input/output formatting.** The input and output of the problem must be formatted correctly. This is often a source of errors, as it can be easy to make a mistake when typing in the input or when writing the output.
3. **Memory errors.** The program may run out of memory if it is not careful about allocating and freeing memory. This can be a difficult problem to debug, as it often manifests itself as a segmentation fault or a runtime error.
4. **Timeout errors.** The program may time out if it takes too long to run. This can be caused by a number of factors, such as an inefficient algorithm or a large input.
5. **Incorrect data.** The input data may be incorrect, which can lead to incorrect results. This can be caused by a number of factors, such as a typo in the input file or a corrupt data file.
6. **Bugs in the operating system or compiler.** The program may crash or produce incorrect results due to a bug in the operating system or compiler. This can be a difficult problem to debug, as it may be difficult to determine the source of the bug.

Title:
CODEFORCES 936_B. Sleepy Game

Pain points:
**Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs:**

* **Incorrect graph representation:** The input graph is represented as a list of lists, where each inner list contains the indices of the vertices that are adjacent to the corresponding vertex. This representation is not always correct, as it does not take into account the direction of the edges. For example, the following graph:

```
0 -> 1
1 -> 2
```

would be represented as the following list of lists:

```
[[0, 1], [1, 2]]
```

However, this representation is incorrect, as the edge from vertex 0 to vertex 1 is directed, meaning that vertex 0 can only move to vertex 1, but not vice versa.

* **Incorrect calculation of the number of possible moves:** The number of possible moves from a vertex is the number of adjacent vertices minus 1. This is because the player cannot move to the vertex that they are currently on. However, this calculation is incorrect if there are any self-loops in the graph. For example, the following graph:

```
0 -> 0
```

would have a number of possible moves from vertex 0 equal to 0, even though there is actually one possible move (to vertex 0).

* **Incorrect determination of whether a player can win:** A player can win if they can reach a vertex with no outgoing edges. However, this is not always possible, as there may be cycles in the graph. For example, the following graph:

```
0 -> 1
1 -> 2
2 -> 0
```

has no vertices with no outgoing edges, so no player can win.

* **Incorrect determination of whether a player can draw:** A player can draw if they can move along a cycle in the graph. However, this is not always possible, as there may be vertices that are not reachable from the starting vertex. For example, the following graph:

```
0 -> 1
1 -> 2
2 -> 3
3 -> 0
```

has no vertices that are reachable from vertex 1, so no player can draw.

**How to Avoid These Problems and Bugs:**

To avoid these problems and bugs, it is important to carefully represent the graph and to correctly calculate the number of possible moves from each vertex. It is also important to correctly determine whether a player can win or draw. This can be done by checking whether there are any vertices with no outgoing edges or any cycles in the graph.

CODEFORCES 961_G. Partitions

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain a space between two integers, or a newline character at the end of the input. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong data type. For example, the input may contain a string instead of an integer. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. The program may make off-by-one errors when computing the sum of the weights of all partitions. For example, the program may forget to include the weight of one of the partitions, or it may include the weight of a partition twice. This can lead to the program producing incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect modular arithmetic**. The program may perform incorrect modular arithmetic operations. For example, the program may add two numbers modulo 109 + 7 and get a result that is greater than 109 + 7. This can lead to the program producing incorrect output.
5. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers**. The program may use floating-point numbers incorrectly. For example, the program may compare two floating-point numbers for equality when they are not exactly equal. This can lead to the program producing incorrect output.
6. **Incorrect use of recursion**. The program may use recursion incorrectly. For example, the program may call a recursive function with a negative argument or with an argument that is too large. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
7. **Incorrect use of dynamic programming**. The program may use dynamic programming incorrectly. For example, the program may use a table that is too small or that is not initialized correctly. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
8. **Incorrect use of memoization**. The program may use memoization incorrectly. For example, the program may use a memoization table that is too small or that is not initialized correctly. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
9. **Incorrect use of bitmasks**. The program may use bitmasks incorrectly. For example, the program may use a bitmask that is too large or that is not initialized correctly. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
10. **Incorrect use of bitwise operators**. The program may use bitwise operators incorrectly. For example, the program may use a bitwise operator on two numbers that are not of the same data type. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.

CODEFORCES 98_A. Help Victoria the Wise

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**

The input format is not correct if it does not contain exactly 6 characters without spaces from the set {R, O, Y, G, B, V}. For example, the input `a` is not correct.

**2. The output format is not correct**

The output format is not correct if it does not contain a single integer. For example, the output `a` is not correct.

**3. The program does not produce the correct output**

The program does not produce the correct output if it does not calculate the number of different ways to decorate the box in the worst case. For example, the program that prints `1` for all inputs does not produce the correct output.

**4. The program does not handle errors correctly**

The program does not handle errors correctly if it does not terminate gracefully when it encounters an error. For example, the program that crashes when it encounters an invalid input does not handle errors correctly.

**5. The program is not efficient**

The program is not efficient if it takes a long time to run or uses a lot of memory. For example, the program that enumerates all possible ways to decorate the box is not efficient.

Title:
HACKEREARTH anagrams-revisited-26

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of comparison operators.** When comparing two strings, you should use the `==` operator, not the `==` operator. The `==` operator compares the two objects' memory addresses, which will always be different for two different strings. The `==` operator compares the two strings' contents, which is what you want.
2. **Incorrect use of the `sort()` function.** The `sort()` function sorts a list in ascending order by default. If you want to sort a list in descending order, you need to pass the `reverse=True` argument to the `sort()` function.
3. **Incorrect use of the `count()` method.** The `count()` method returns the number of times a specified value appears in a list. If you want to find the index of the first occurrence of a specified value in a list, you need to use the `index()` method.
4. **Incorrect use of the `in` operator.** The `in` operator checks whether a specified value is in a list. If you want to check whether a specified value is not in a list, you need to use the `not in` operator.
5. **Incorrect use of the `len()` function.** The `len()` function returns the length of a list. If you want to get the last element of a list, you need to use the `-1` index.

Here are some tips for avoiding these common problems:

* Use the `==` operator to compare strings, and the `sort()` function with the `reverse=True` argument to sort a list in descending order.
* Use the `count()` method to find the number of times a specified value appears in a list, and the `index()` method to find the index of the first occurrence of a specified value in a list.
* Use the `not in` operator to check whether a specified value is not in a list, and the `-1` index to get the last element of a list.

Title:
HACKEREARTH center-in-mass-2

Pain points:
1. **Inaccurate floating-point arithmetic**. The problem statement specifies that the output should have an absolute or relative error of at most 10-5. This is a very small error, and it can be difficult to achieve in practice. One common way to introduce errors is to use floating-point arithmetic. Floating-point arithmetic is not exact, and it can introduce rounding errors that can accumulate over time. To avoid this problem, you can use fixed-point arithmetic or rational arithmetic.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that occurs when you forget to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can happen when you are iterating over a list or array, or when you are computing the size of a data structure. To avoid this problem, you should be careful to check the bounds of your loops and arrays.
3. **Indexing errors**. Indexing errors occur when you access an element of an array or list at the wrong index. This can happen when you are iterating over a list or array, or when you are computing the size of a data structure. To avoid this problem, you should be careful to check the bounds of your loops and arrays.
4. **Null pointer dereferences**. Null pointer dereferences occur when you try to access a memory address that is not initialized. This can happen when you are using pointers or references, or when you are allocating memory on the heap. To avoid this problem, you should always check to make sure that a pointer or reference is not null before you dereference it.
5. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when you allocate memory on the heap and then forget to free it. This can eventually lead to a program running out of memory. To avoid this problem, you should always free memory that you have allocated on the heap.
6. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and data corruption. To avoid this problem, you should use synchronization mechanisms to ensure that only one thread can access data at a time.
7. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can prevent any of the threads from making progress. To avoid this problem, you should use deadlock avoidance or deadlock prevention techniques.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can occur when you write code that is not secure. This can allow attackers to exploit your code and gain unauthorized access to your system. To avoid this problem, you should follow secure coding practices.

Title:
HACKEREARTH dice-rolls

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect calculation of the expected number of rolls.** The expected number of rolls is not simply the number of rolls needed to get N consecutive even numbers, but it is also weighted by the probability of getting N consecutive even numbers in that number of rolls. For example, if N = 2 and M = 1, the expected number of rolls is not 1, but rather 1 + (0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 6) = 4.0.
2. Incorrect handling of the case where M is greater than N. In this case, the expected number of rolls is simply 0, as the dice has already been rolled enough times to get N consecutive even numbers.
3. Incorrect handling of the case where N is less than 1. In this case, the expected number of rolls is undefined, as it is impossible to get N consecutive even numbers with a single roll of the dice.
4. Incorrect handling of the input data. The input data may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers greater than 1000. The code should be able to handle these invalid values gracefully.
5. Incorrect output formatting. The output should be rounded to exactly 2 decimal places.
6. Incorrect use of floating-point arithmetic. Floating-point arithmetic is notoriously imprecise, so it is important to use it carefully to avoid rounding errors.
7. Incorrect use of the random number generator. The random number generator should be seeded with a random seed to ensure that the results are reproducible.

Title:
HACKEREARTH lazy-verma-2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem states that the first line should contain two space-separated integers `N` and `M`, the second line should contain `N` space-separated integers `Ai`, and the third line should contain `M` space-separated integers `Bi`. However, if the input format is not followed, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The problem states that the integers in the input should be between -1000 and 1000. However, if the input contains integers outside of this range, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect calculations**. The program should calculate the sum of the products of all the numbers in the first array with all the numbers in the second array. However, if the program makes a mistake in its calculations, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program should not allocate any memory that it does not need. If the program allocates too much memory, it may crash or run out of memory.
5. **Race conditions**. The program should not be susceptible to race conditions. A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. If the program is not thread-safe, it may produce incorrect results or crash.
6. **Synchronization issues**. The program should not have any synchronization issues. A synchronization issue occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time and the order in which the threads access the data is important. If the program is not synchronized, it may produce incorrect results or crash.
7. **Deadlocks**. The program should not have any deadlocks. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. If the program deadlocks, it will not be able to continue running.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program should not have any security vulnerabilities. A security vulnerability is a weakness in the program that could be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the program or the data it processes.
9. **Performance issues**. The program should be efficient and should not have any performance issues. A performance issue occurs when the program takes too long to run or uses too much memory.
10. **Usability issues**. The program should be easy to use and should not have any usability issues. A usability issue occurs when the program is difficult to use or understand.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of edges in the graph.** The monk may incorrectly count the number of edges in the graph, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, if the graph has 3 vertices and 2 edges, the monk may incorrectly count 3 edges (1 edge for each pair of vertices).
2. **Not considering the possibility of multiple edges between two vertices.** The monk may not consider the possibility of multiple edges between two vertices. For example, if the graph has 3 vertices and 2 edges, the monk may incorrectly assume that there is only one edge between each pair of vertices.
3. **Not considering the possibility of self-loops in the graph.** The monk may not consider the possibility of self-loops in the graph. For example, if the graph has 3 vertices and 2 edges, the monk may incorrectly assume that there are no self-loops.
4. **Not considering the possibility of disconnected graphs.** The monk may not consider the possibility of disconnected graphs. For example, if the graph has 3 vertices and 2 edges, the monk may incorrectly assume that the graph is connected.
5. **Not considering the possibility of graphs with cycles.** The monk may not consider the possibility of graphs with cycles. For example, if the graph has 3 vertices and 2 edges, the monk may incorrectly assume that the graph does not have any cycles.

Title:
HACKEREARTH permutation-swaps

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data contains integers, so the developer should use the `int` data type to store the values. Using the wrong data type, such as `string`, could lead to incorrect results.

**2. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5` and `1 ≤ M ≤ 10^5`. The developer should make sure to handle these edge cases correctly. For example, if `N = 0`, the developer should return `"YES"` without performing any swaps.

**3. Not using the provided data structures**

The problem statement provides a list of good pairs. The developer should use this list to efficiently find the swaps that need to be performed. For example, the developer could use a hash table to store the good pairs.

**4. Making incorrect assumptions**

The developer should carefully read the problem statement and make sure to understand all of the constraints. For example, the problem statement specifies that the good pairs are distinct. The developer should make sure to check for this condition before performing any swaps.

**5. Not using a test suite**

The developer should write a test suite to verify that their code is correct. The test suite should include tests for all of the different cases that the developer can think of. For example, the test suite should include tests for the following cases:

* `N = 0`
* `M = 0`
* `N = 1`
* `M = 1`
* `N = 2`
* `M = 2`
* `N = 3`
* `M = 3`
* `N = 4`
* `M = 4`

By testing their code thoroughly, the developer can catch bugs early and prevent them from causing problems in production.

Title:
HACKEREARTH roy-and-rangoli-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulo operation.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. For example, 5 % 3 is 2 because 5 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2. When using the modulo operator, it is important to make sure that the dividend is less than the divisor. If the dividend is greater than the divisor, the modulo operator will return the same number as the dividend.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors occur when a programmer forgets to add or subtract 1 from a calculation. This can lead to incorrect results. For example, if a programmer is trying to calculate the sum of the first 100 numbers, they might forget to add 1 to the final number, which would result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect array bounds.** Array bounds errors occur when a programmer tries to access an element of an array that is outside of the bounds of the array. This can lead to a runtime error. For example, if a programmer tries to access the element at index 100 of an array that only has 10 elements, they will get an error.
4. **Incorrect use of pointers.** Pointers are a powerful tool that can be used to access data in memory. However, if they are not used correctly, they can lead to errors. For example, if a programmer tries to dereference a pointer that is not pointing to a valid memory address, they will get a runtime error.
5. **Incorrect use of functions.** Functions are a way to group together related code. However, if they are not used correctly, they can lead to errors. For example, if a programmer forgets to pass a required argument to a function, they will get a compile-time error.
6. **Incorrect use of data structures.** Data structures are used to organize data in memory. However, if they are not used correctly, they can lead to errors. For example, if a programmer tries to insert an element into a full queue, they will get a runtime error.
7. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** Algorithms are a set of steps that are used to solve a problem. However, if they are not used correctly, they can lead to errors. For example, if a programmer uses a sorting algorithm that is not suited for the data they are sorting, they will get a runtime error.
8. **Incorrect use of libraries.** Libraries are collections of code that can be used to perform common tasks. However, if they are not used correctly, they can lead to errors. For example, if a programmer uses a library that has not been updated for a new version of the compiler, they may get a compile-time error.
9. **Incorrect use of system calls.** System calls are used to interact with the operating system. However, if they are not used correctly, they can lead to errors. For example, if a programmer tries to open a file that does not exist, they will get a runtime error.
10. **Incorrect use of concurrency.** Concurrency is the ability of a program to run multiple tasks at the same time. However, if it is not used correctly, it can lead to errors. For example, if two tasks try to access the same data at the same time, they can corrupt the data.

Title:
HACKEREARTH subly-again

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be two integers separated by a single space. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce an incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect use of modulo operator**. The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. If the divisor is not a prime number, the modulo operator will not return the correct remainder.
3. **Incorrect use of factorial function**. The factorial function (``math.factorial()``) returns the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given number. If the given number is not a positive integer, the factorial function will return an incorrect value.
4. **Incorrect use of prime number generator**. The prime number generator (``is_prime()``) returns a boolean value indicating whether a given number is prime. If the given number is not a positive integer, the prime number generator will return an incorrect value.
5. **Incorrect use of list comprehension**. List comprehension is a powerful tool that can be used to create lists of values from other iterables. If the iterable is not a valid list, the list comprehension will not work correctly.
6. **Incorrect use of range function**. The range function returns a sequence of numbers from a starting point to an ending point. If the starting point or ending point is not a valid integer, the range function will not work correctly.
7. **Incorrect use of for loop**. The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence of values. If the sequence is not a valid iterable, the for loop will not work correctly.
8. **Incorrect use of if statement**. The if statement is used to check for a condition and execute code if the condition is true. If the condition is not a valid boolean expression, the if statement will not work correctly.
9. **Incorrect use of else statement**. The else statement is used to execute code if the condition in an if statement is false. If the if statement does not have a condition, the else statement will not be executed.
10. **Incorrect use of return statement**. The return statement is used to exit a function and return a value. If the return statement is not used correctly, the function will not return a value.

Title:
HACKEREARTH valentines-day-surprise-gift

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the R(n) function.** The R(n) function is defined as follows:

```
R(n) = 1, if n = 0 or n = 1
R(n) = product of all odd primes less than or equal to n, if n <= 10
R(n) = (2^(n/4) × R(n/5) × R(n/10)) *mod (10^9+7), if n > 10
```

A common mistake is to forget to apply the modulo operator when computing R(n) for n > 10. This can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect implementation of the gcd function.** The gcd function is defined as follows:

```
gcd(x, y) = gcd(y, x % y), if y > 0
gcd(x, 0) = x
```

A common mistake is to forget to check if y is greater than 0 before calling the gcd function. This can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Incorrect implementation of the maximum value calculation.** The maximum value of x^y mod (10^9 + 7) is given by the following formula:

```
max(x^y) mod (10^9 + 7) = (x^y) mod (10^9 + 7)
```

A common mistake is to forget to apply the modulo operator when computing the maximum value. This can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Incorrect input handling.** The input to the problem is a list of integers, one per line. A common mistake is to forget to check if the input is valid. This can lead to incorrect results or a runtime error.

5. **Incorrect output handling.** The output to the problem is a single integer. A common mistake is to forget to print the output. This can lead to a runtime error.

**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input format is not very clear. It is not obvious what the meaning of each line is.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if there are no residential areas in a given region.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the sum of the populations of all residential areas is not equal to 1000000.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the coordinates of a residential area are not integers.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the population of a residential area is not a positive integer.

* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the values of X_i, Y_i, and P_i are not within the specified ranges.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input is not in the correct format.

**Possible solutions:**

* To make the input format more clear, we can provide a table that lists the meaning of each line.
* To handle the case where there are no residential areas in a given region, we can simply return 0.
* To handle the case where the sum of the populations of all residential areas is not equal to 1000000, we can simply return an error.
* To handle the case where the coordinates of a residential area are not integers, we can simply return an error.
* To handle the case where the population of a residential area is not a positive integer, we can simply return an error.
* To handle the case where there are two or more residential areas with the same coordinates, we can simply return an error.
* To handle the case where the number of residential areas is not between 1 and 15, we can simply return an error.
* To handle the case where the values of X_i, Y_i, and P_i are not within the specified ranges, we can simply return an error.
* To handle the case where the input is not in the correct format, we can simply return an error.

ATCODER p02735 AtCoder Grand Contest 043 - Range Flip Find Route

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect assumptions**

One common mistake is to assume that the grid is always rectangular. In fact, the grid can be any shape, as long as it has a finite number of rows and columns.

Another common mistake is to assume that the grid is always 2D. In fact, the grid can be any number of dimensions, as long as each dimension has a finite number of elements.

**2. Incorrect implementation**

Another common mistake is to implement the algorithm incorrectly. For example, you might accidentally flip the colors of the wrong squares, or you might not account for all of the possible cases.

**3. Incorrect testing**

It is important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. This includes testing for all possible inputs, as well as edge cases.

**4. Incorrect debugging**

If your code is not working correctly, it can be difficult to debug. One common mistake is to try to debug the code without first understanding the problem. It is important to first identify the problem, and then to debug the code accordingly.

**5. Incorrect assumptions about the problem**

Another common mistake is to make incorrect assumptions about the problem. For example, you might assume that the problem is easier than it actually is, or you might assume that the problem is harder than it actually is. It is important to understand the problem before you start working on a solution.

Title:
ATCODER p03004 AtCoder Beginner Contest 130 - Minimum Bounding Box

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data contains a lot of integers with large absolute values. If we use a data type with a small range, such as `int`, we may get incorrect results. For example, if we use `int` to store the coordinates of a point, then the maximum value of `x_max - x_min` will be `2 * 10^8`, which is larger than the maximum value of `int` (which is `2 * 10^9`).

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The naive algorithm for solving this problem is to iterate over all possible pairs of points and calculate the minimum possible value of `(x_{max} - x_{min}) \times (y_{max} - y_{min})`. This algorithm has a time complexity of `O(N^2)`, which is too slow for large values of `N`.

**3. Not handling corner cases**

The input data may contain corner cases, such as points with coordinates `(0, 0)` or `(-∞, -∞)`. We need to handle these corner cases carefully to avoid getting incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is `(x_{max} - x_{min}) \times (y_{max} - y_{min})`. We need to make sure that our output is in the correct format.

**5. Floating-point errors**

The output of this problem may contain floating-point numbers. We need to make sure that our output is accurate to within `10^{-9}`.

**6. Memory errors**

The input data may contain a large number of points. We need to make sure that we have enough memory to store all of the points.

ATCODER p03144 NIKKEI Programming Contest 2019 - Jewels

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input format is not clear. For example, it is not clear whether the first line of input is `N K` or `N, K`.
* The output format is not clear. For example, it is not clear whether the output should be a single integer or a list of integers.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if there are not enough jewels of a particular color to satisfy the condition.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the sum of the values of all the jewels is less than the maximum possible sum.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input is invalid.

Here are some possible solutions to these problems and bugs:

* The input format can be made clearer by using a multiline string to represent the input. For example, the input could be represented as follows:

```
N, K = map(int, input().split())
jewels = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(N)]
```

* The output format can be made clearer by using a list of integers to represent the output. For example, the output could be represented as follows:

```
print([-1] + [max([jewel[1] for jewel in jewels if jewel[0] == i]) for i in range(1, N + 1)])
```

* The problem statement can be clarified by specifying that if there are not enough jewels of a particular color to satisfy the condition, then the maximum possible sum is -1.
* The problem statement can be clarified by specifying that if the sum of the values of all the jewels is less than the maximum possible sum, then the maximum possible sum is the sum of the values of all the jewels.
* The problem statement can be clarified by specifying that if the input is invalid, then the output should be an error message.

Here is an example of a solution to the problem that addresses all of the potential problems and bugs:

```
def main():
    N, K = map(int, input().split())
    jewels = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(N)]

    # Sort the jewels by color.

    jewels.sort(key=lambda jewel: jewel[0])

    # Initialize a list to store the maximum possible sum of the values of the chosen jewels for each number of jewels.

    max_sums = [-1] * (N + 1)

    # Iterate over the number of jewels to choose.

    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        # Initialize the maximum possible sum of the values of the chosen jewels for the current number of jewels.

        max_sum = -1

        # Iterate over the jewels.

        for j in range(N):
            # If the current jewel is of the same color as the previous jewel, then add its value to the maximum possible sum.

            if j > 0 and jewels[j][0] == jewels[j - 1][0]:
                max_sum += jewels[j][1]

            # Otherwise, if the current jewel is of a different color than the previous jewel, then set the maximum possible sum to the value of the current jewel.

            else:
                max_sum = jewels[j][1]

        # Update the maximum possible sum of the values of the chosen jewels for the current number of jewels.

Title:
ATCODER p03444 AtCoder Petrozavodsk Contest 001 - Generalized Insertion Sort

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The most important bug that a developer may encounter when solving this problem is an incorrect implementation of the algorithm. This could lead to the program not working correctly or producing incorrect results.

To avoid this bug, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the steps of the algorithm. It is also important to test the algorithm thoroughly to ensure that it is working correctly.

**2. Using incorrect data types**

Another common bug that developers may encounter is using incorrect data types. For example, if the problem statement specifies that the input should be a string, but the developer uses an integer, the program will not work correctly.

To avoid this bug, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the data types of the input and output. It is also important to use the correct data types in the code.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that can occur when the developer accidentally miscounts or misindexes an element in an array or list. This can lead to the program skipping or repeating an element, which can cause incorrect results.

To avoid this bug, it is important to carefully count and index elements in arrays and lists. It is also helpful to use a debugger to check the values of variables and arrays as the program executes.

**4. Memory leaks**

Memory leaks can occur when a developer allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

To avoid this bug, it is important to use the `delete` keyword to free memory that is no longer needed. It is also helpful to use a memory profiler to identify and fix memory leaks.

**5. Undefined behavior**

Undefined behavior occurs when the compiler is not able to determine the outcome of a certain piece of code. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

To avoid this bug, it is important to avoid using undefined behavior in code. This means using the correct data types, following the rules of operator precedence, and using the correct control flow statements.

**6. Race conditions**

Race conditions can occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

To avoid this bug, it is important to use synchronization mechanisms to ensure that only one thread can access the data at a time.

**7. Deadlocks**

Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can lead to the program being stuck in an infinite loop.

To avoid this bug, it is important to use synchronization mechanisms to ensure that only one thread can hold a lock at a time.

Title:
AIZU p01527 Tree Planting

Pain points:
1. **Wrong input format.** The input format is not correct. For example, the input format is missing the first line.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The input data is not in the correct data type. For example, the input data is a string instead of an integer.
3. **Out-of-bounds access.** The program tries to access an element that is out of bounds of the array. For example, the program tries to access the element at index 100 in an array that only has 10 elements.
4. **Null pointer exception.** The program tries to access a null pointer. For example, the program tries to access the element of an array that has not been initialized.
5. **Arithmetic overflow.** The program performs an arithmetic operation that results in an overflow. For example, the program tries to divide a number by zero.
6. **Stack overflow.** The program calls too many functions or recursively calls itself too many times, causing the stack to overflow.
7. **Infinite loop.** The program enters an infinite loop and never terminates.
8. **Incorrect algorithm.** The program uses an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem, resulting in an incorrect output.
9. **Memory leak.** The program does not release memory that it has allocated, causing the program to run out of memory.

Title:
AIZU p01685 Overwriting Game

Pain points:
**Possible Problems and Bugs**

* **Incorrect Input Handling**
  * The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the number of rows and columns may not be separated by a space, or the coloring configuration may not be properly formatted.
  * The input may contain invalid characters, such as non-alphabetic characters or numbers.
  * The input may be too large to be processed by the program.
* **Incorrect Calculation**
  * The expected number of painted cells may be calculated incorrectly. For example, the calculation may not take into account the fact that some cells may be painted multiple times.
  * The calculation may be incorrect due to floating-point rounding errors.
* **Incorrect Output**
  * The output may not be formatted correctly. For example, the output may not be rounded to the specified number of decimal places.
  * The output may not be within the specified range.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the program thoroughly with a variety of inputs to ensure that it is working correctly.

Title:
AIZU p01829 Change a Password

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is "n", where "n" is an integer. If the input is not in this format, the program will crash.

**2. Negative input**

The input "n" should be a positive integer. If the input is negative, the program will crash.

**3. Out-of-bounds input**

The input "n" should be less than 10^18. If the input is greater than 10^18, the program will output incorrect results.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

When adding 1 to "n", it is easy to make a mistake and add 2 instead. This will result in an incorrect output.

**5. Using the wrong data type**

The input "n" should be stored as an integer. If it is stored as a floating-point number, the program will output incorrect results.

**6. Using the wrong algorithm**

The naive algorithm for this problem is to add 1 to each digit of "n". This algorithm is inefficient and will not work for large inputs. A more efficient algorithm is to use modular arithmetic.

Title:
AIZU p01964 Revenge of the Endless BFS

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of BFS**. The pseudocode of BFS is as follows:

```
1: current ← {start_vertex}
2: visited ← current
3: while visited ≠ the set of all the vertices
4:   found ← {}
5:   for u in current
6:     for each v such that there is an edge from u to v
7:       found ← found ∪ {v}
8:   current ← found ∖ visited
9:   visited ← visited ∪ found
```

Mr. Endo's implementation is as follows:

```
1: current ← {start_vertex}
2: while current ≠ the set of all the vertices
3:   found ← {}
4:   for u in current
5:     for each v such that there is an edge from u to v
6:       found ← found ∪ {v}
7:   current ← found
```

The difference between the two implementations is that Mr. Endo's implementation does not maintain a visited set. This means that a vertex may be visited multiple times, which can lead to an infinite loop.

2. **Incorrect termination condition**. The termination condition of BFS is that the current set of vertices is equal to the set of all vertices. Mr. Endo's implementation does not check this condition, which can also lead to an infinite loop.

3. **Incorrect handling of cycles**. A cycle in a directed graph is a sequence of vertices such that each vertex is reachable from the previous vertex in the sequence. If a graph contains a cycle, then BFS may not terminate. Mr. Endo's implementation does not handle cycles correctly, which can also lead to an infinite loop.

4. **Incorrect handling of multiple edges**. A multiple edge in a directed graph is an edge that exists between two vertices more than once. Mr. Endo's implementation does not handle multiple edges correctly, which can also lead to an infinite loop.

5. **Incorrect handling of self-loops**. A self-loop in a directed graph is an edge that exists from a vertex to itself. Mr. Endo's implementation does not handle self-loops correctly, which can also lead to an infinite loop.

**1. The input format is not specified**. Does the input need to be a number? Does it need to be in degrees? Does it need to be in a certain range?
2. The output format is not specified. Does the output need to be in the format `h m`? Does it need to be separated by a space?
3. The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input is invalid. For example, what if the input is not a number? What if the input is outside the specified range?
4. The problem statement does not specify how to handle rounding errors. For example, what if the input is 45 degrees? Should the output be `1 30` or `1 31`?
5. The problem statement does not specify how to handle negative angles. For example, what if the input is -45 degrees?

Title:
AIZU p02251 Change Making

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm.** The greedy algorithm for this problem is to first use as many 25-cent coins as possible, then as many 10-cent coins as possible, then as many 5-cent coins as possible, and finally as many 1-cent coins as possible. However, if the number of cents is not divisible by 25, then the greedy algorithm will not find the minimum number of coins. For example, if the number of cents is 30, the greedy algorithm will use 1 25-cent coin and 1 5-cent coin, for a total of 2 coins. However, the minimum number of coins is 1 10-cent coin and 1 5-cent coin, for a total of 2 coins.
2. **Off-by-one error in the calculation of the number of coins.** When calculating the number of coins, it is important to make sure that the number of coins is not one more than the number of cents. For example, if the number of cents is 100, the number of coins is 4, not 5.
3. **Incorrect handling of negative numbers.** The input for this problem is a positive integer. However, if the input is a negative integer, the greedy algorithm will not work correctly. For example, if the input is -100, the greedy algorithm will use 4 25-cent coins, for a total of -100 coins.
4. **Incorrect handling of zero.** The input for this problem can be zero. However, if the input is zero, the greedy algorithm will not work correctly. For example, if the input is 0, the greedy algorithm will use 1 1-cent coin, for a total of 1 coin.
