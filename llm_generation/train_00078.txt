CODECHEF buy1get1

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input string `S` can contain letters from both upper and lower case. If we use `char` to store each character in `S`, we will need to convert it to lowercase or uppercase before comparing two characters. This will lead to an unnecessary performance penalty.

A better solution is to use `string` to store `S`. This way, we can compare two characters directly without any conversion.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The naive algorithm for this problem is to iterate over the string `S` and count the number of each character. Then, we can calculate the minimum cost by adding up the cost of each character.

This algorithm has a time complexity of `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the length of `S`. This is because we need to iterate over the string twice.

A better algorithm is to use a hash table to store the number of each character. This way, we can calculate the minimum cost in a single pass over the string.

The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(n)`, which is much better than the naive algorithm.

**3. Not handling corner cases**

The input string `S` may contain invalid characters. For example, it may contain characters that are not letters. We need to make sure that we handle these cases correctly.

We can do this by checking each character in `S` to make sure that it is a letter. If a character is not a letter, we can simply ignore it.

**4. Not using the best data structure**

The best data structure for this problem is a hash table. A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. We can use a hash table to store the number of each character in `S`. This way, we can quickly calculate the minimum cost by looking up the number of each character in the hash table.

We can also use a binary search tree to solve this problem. A binary search tree is a data structure that stores data in a sorted order. We can use a binary search tree to find the minimum cost by traversing the tree from the root node to the leaf node.

However, a hash table is a more efficient data structure for this problem than a binary search tree. This is because a hash table can quickly look up the number of each character in `S`, while a binary search tree must traverse the tree from the root node to the leaf node.

CODECHEF comr03

Pain points:
1. **Off by one error**. The developer may forget to take into account the base case when calculating the number of patterns. For example, if the number of bulbs is 1, the number of patterns is 1, not 0.
2. **Incorrect modulo operation**. The developer may incorrectly perform the modulo operation when calculating the number of patterns. For example, if the number of patterns is 1000 and the modulo is 100, the developer may incorrectly calculate the number of patterns as 0.
3. **Incorrect data type**. The developer may use an incorrect data type to store the number of patterns. For example, if the number of patterns is large, the developer may use an integer to store the number of patterns, which could lead to overflow errors.
4. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to calculate the number of patterns. For example, the developer may use a recursive algorithm to calculate the number of patterns, which could lead to stack overflow errors.
5. **Incorrect error handling**. The developer may not handle errors correctly. For example, if the input is invalid, the developer may not print an error message.

Title:
CODECHEF maandi

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Single line of each test case contains an integer n. However, the input may not follow this format. For example, the input may contain a string instead of an integer. In this case, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that for each test case on different lines print the answer to the problem. However, the program may output the answer in the wrong format. For example, the program may output the answer in the same line instead of different lines. In this case, the program will receive a wrong answer.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of overlucky dividers.** The program may incorrectly calculate the number of overlucky dividers. For example, the program may count a number as an overlucky divider even if it is not. In this case, the program will receive a wrong answer.
4. **Incorrect handling of overflows.** The program may incorrectly handle overflows. For example, the program may try to divide a number by zero. In this case, the program will crash.
5. **Incorrect use of pointers.** The program may incorrectly use pointers. For example, the program may dereference a null pointer. In this case, the program will crash.
6. **Incorrect use of memory.** The program may incorrectly allocate or free memory. For example, the program may allocate memory that it does not need. In this case, the program may run out of memory.

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not clear.** The input format is not clear. It is not clear whether the input is a string or a list of strings. It is also not clear whether the time is in 24-hour format or 12-hour format.
2. **The output format is not clear.** The output format is not clear. It is not clear whether the output should be a number or a list of numbers.
3. **The problem statement is not clear.** The problem statement is not clear. It is not clear what is meant by a "perfect time". It is also not clear what is meant by "the Chef's time to be lucky".
4. **The code is not correct.** The code is not correct. It does not correctly count the number of perfect times in the input string.
5. **The code is not efficient.** The code is not efficient. It takes O(n^2) time to count the number of perfect times in the input string, where n is the length of the input string.

Here are some suggestions to fix these problems:

1. **Make the input format clear.** The input format should be a list of strings, where each string is a time in the format HH:MM. The time should be in 24-hour format.
2. **Make the output format clear.** The output format should be a number, which is the number of perfect times in the input list.
3. **Rephrase the problem statement.** The problem statement should be rephrased to make it clear what is meant by a "perfect time" and what is meant by "the Chef's time to be lucky".
4. **Fix the code.** The code should be fixed so that it correctly counts the number of perfect times in the input string.
5. **Optimize the code.** The code should be optimized so that it takes O(n) time to count the number of perfect times in the input string, where n is the length of the input string.

Title:
CODECHEF time

Pain points:
1. **Recursion**. The function `fun()` is recursive, which means it calls itself. This can lead to a stack overflow if the function is called with a large value of `n`.
2. **Time complexity**. The time complexity of the function `fun()` is O(2^n), which is exponential. This means that the function will take longer and longer to run as `n` increases.
3. **Space complexity**. The space complexity of the function `fun()` is O(n), which is linear. This means that the function will use more and more memory as `n` increases.

To avoid these problems, we can use a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. Dynamic programming is a technique that can be used to reduce the time and space complexity of recursive problems. In this case, we can use a table to store the values of `fun()` for different values of `n`. This will allow us to avoid the recursive calls and reduce the time complexity to O(n). It will also reduce the space complexity to O(n), which is the same as the time complexity.

Here is the dynamic programming solution to the problem:

```
def fun(n):
    table = [0] * (n + 1)
    table[0] = 1
    table[1] = 2
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        table[i] = table[i - 1] + table[i - 2]
    return table[n]

CODEFORCES 1013_B. And

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always strictly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong type. For example, the numbers may be entered as strings instead of integers. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program may contain errors in its logic. For example, it may not correctly check if the input is valid, or it may not correctly calculate the output. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The program may make off-by-one errors when calculating the output. For example, it may count the number of elements in the array incorrectly, or it may not correctly apply the bitwise AND operation. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
5. **Memory leaks**. The program may not release memory that it has allocated. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions**. The program may not be thread-safe. This can lead to incorrect output if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may contain security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or SQL injection. This can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or its data.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully test your code and to use a robust programming language and development environment.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1037_H. Security

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect use of comparison operators.** When comparing two strings, it is important to use the `>` operator, not the `==` operator. The `==` operator only checks if two strings are equal, while the `>` operator checks if one string is lexicographically greater than the other.
2. **Incorrect use of substrings.** When extracting a substring from a string, it is important to make sure that the start and end indices are valid. The start index must be less than the end index, and the end index must not be greater than the length of the string.
3. **Incorrect use of recursion.** Recursion can be a powerful tool for solving problems, but it is important to be careful not to make any mistakes. One common mistake is to forget to check the base case. The base case is the case where the recursion terminates, and it is important to make sure that this case is handled correctly.
4. **Incorrect use of dynamic programming.** Dynamic programming can be a very efficient way to solve problems, but it is important to be careful not to make any mistakes. One common mistake is to use the wrong recurrence relation. The recurrence relation should describe the relationship between the optimal solution to the subproblems and the optimal solution to the problem.
5. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The choice of data structure can have a significant impact on the performance of your program. It is important to choose a data structure that is well-suited for the problem you are trying to solve.

**Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:**

* A developer might incorrectly compare two strings using the `==` operator. This would result in the incorrect answer being returned.
* A developer might try to extract a substring from a string with an invalid start or end index. This would cause an error to be thrown.
* A developer might use recursion incorrectly and forget to check the base case. This would cause the program to enter an infinite loop.
* A developer might use dynamic programming incorrectly and use the wrong recurrence relation. This would result in the incorrect answer being returned.
* A developer might use the wrong data structure for the problem. This would result in the program running inefficiently.

CODEFORCES 1060_D. Social Circles

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format should be `n`, followed by `n` lines of `l_i, r_i` pairs. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will output incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of chairs.** The minimum number of chairs is the sum of the maximum number of chairs needed by each guest. To calculate the maximum number of chairs needed by each guest, we need to find the maximum value of `l_i + r_i` for all guests. If this value is greater than the number of chairs available, then we need to use more chairs.
3. **Incorrect output.** The output should be a single integer, the minimum number of chairs needed. If the output is not a single integer, or if it is not the minimum number of chairs needed, the program will not be correct.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

* Make sure that you understand the input format and the output format.
* Carefully calculate the maximum number of chairs needed by each guest.
* Make sure that your output is a single integer and that it is the minimum number of chairs needed.

Here is an example of a correct solution to the problem:

```
n = int(input())
chairs = [0] * n
for i in range(n):
    l, r = map(int, input().split())
    chairs[i] = max(l, r)
print(sum(chairs))

CODEFORCES 1101_D. GCD Counting

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The most common mistake is to incorrectly implement the algorithm. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as using the wrong data structures or making a mistake in the logic. To avoid this, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the algorithm before implementing it. It is also helpful to test your implementation on small test cases to make sure it is correct.

**2. Incorrect input**

Another common mistake is to incorrectly read the input. This can happen if the input is not formatted correctly or if the data is not in the correct format. To avoid this, it is important to carefully read the input and make sure that it is correct. It is also helpful to test your program on small test cases to make sure that it can handle different types of input.

**3. Runtime errors**

Another common mistake is to make a runtime error. This can happen if the program runs out of memory or if it tries to access an invalid memory location. To avoid this, it is important to use the correct data structures and to make sure that the program does not access invalid memory locations. It is also helpful to test your program on large test cases to make sure that it can handle large amounts of data.

**4. Logical errors**

Another common mistake is to make a logical error. This can happen if the program does not correctly implement the algorithm or if it makes a mistake in the logic. To avoid this, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the algorithm. It is also helpful to test your program on small test cases to make sure that it is correct.

**5. Off-by-one errors**

A common mistake is to make an off-by-one error. This can happen if the program does not correctly account for the first or last element in a list or array. To avoid this, it is important to carefully check the code to make sure that all of the elements are being processed correctly.

4. **Off-by-one error.** The program may incorrectly check whether the square is possible to cut. For example, the program may incorrectly check whether the marked cell is on the diagonal of the square.
5. **Incorrect algorithm.** The program may use an incorrect algorithm to check whether the square is possible to cut. For example, the program may check whether the square is possible to cut by dividing the square into two equal parts. However, this algorithm is incorrect because the two parts may not be equal up to rotation.
6. **Memory leak.** The program may not release the memory that it allocated. This can lead to a memory leak.
7. **Security vulnerability.** The program may not be secure. For example, the program may allow a user to input arbitrary data. This can be exploited by a malicious user to attack the program.

CODEFORCES 1189_F. Array Beauty

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain a number that is too large, or it may contain two space-separated integers instead of one. The developer should check the input format carefully and handle any errors that may occur.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the beauty of a subsequence**. The beauty of a subsequence is the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the subsequence. The developer should be careful to calculate this correctly, especially when the subsequence contains duplicate elements.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the sum of the beauty of all subsequences**. The sum of the beauty of all subsequences can be a very large number. The developer should be careful to handle this correctly, by using a data type that can store large numbers and by using modulo arithmetic to avoid overflow.
4. **Incorrect output**. The output should be a single integer, which is the sum of the beauty of all subsequences of the given length. The developer should be careful to format the output correctly and to ensure that it is within the range of the data type that is being used.
5. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other potential bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the developer may incorrectly handle boundary cases, or they may make a mistake in their algorithm. The developer should carefully review their code to ensure that it is correct.

CODEFORCES 1292_B. Aroma's Search

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The input variables are defined as integers, but the code uses them as floats. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Off-by-one error:** The code checks if the current node is the last node by comparing its index to the number of nodes minus 1. This is incorrect, as the last node has index `n - 1`.
3. **Infinite loop:** The code uses a while loop to iterate over the nodes, but it does not check if the loop has reached the end. This can lead to an infinite loop.
4. **Incorrect algorithm:** The code uses a greedy algorithm to find the maximum number of nodes that can be collected. This algorithm does not always find the optimal solution.
5. **Memory leak:** The code does not free the memory allocated for the nodes. This can lead to a memory leak.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully check the types of your variables, use the correct comparison operators, and use a finite loop. You should also test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct.

CODEFORCES 1334_G. Substring Search

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specified in the problem statement is very strict. Make sure that your input format is exactly the same as the one specified in the problem statement.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specified in the problem statement is very strict. Make sure that your output format is exactly the same as the one specified in the problem statement.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**. The algorithm you implemented may not be correct. Make sure that you understand the problem statement and the algorithm carefully before implementing it.
4. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of some variables may be incorrect. Make sure that you use the correct data type for each variable.
5. **Off-by-one errors**. Make sure that you account for the boundary conditions correctly.
6. **Memory leaks**. Make sure that you free any allocated memory when you are done with it.
7. **Synchronization issues**. If your program is multi-threaded, make sure that you synchronize access to shared resources correctly.
8. **Race conditions**. If your program is multi-threaded, make sure that you avoid race conditions.
9. **Deadlocks**. If your program is multi-threaded, make sure that you avoid deadlocks.
10. **Uncaught exceptions**. Make sure that you catch and handle all exceptions that your program may throw.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format specified in the problem statement is very strict. For example, the input should contain exactly 26 integers, each integer should be between 1 and 26, and all integers should be pairwise distinct. If your input format is not correct, the program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format specified in the problem statement is very strict. For example, the output should be a string of |t| - |s| + 1 characters, each character should be either 0 or 1, and the i-th character should be 1 if and only if the substring of t starting with the i-th character and ending with the (i + |s| - 1)-th character (inclusive) is an occurence of s. If your output format is not correct, the program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.
* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm:** The algorithm you implemented may not be correct. For example, you may have forgotten to account for the boundary conditions correctly, or you may have used the wrong data type for some variables. If your algorithm is not correct, the program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.
* **Incorrect data type:** The data type of some variables may be incorrect. For example, you may have used an integer to store a floating-point number, or you may have used a string to store a Boolean value. If the data type of some variables is incorrect, the program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.
* **Off-by-one errors:** Make sure that you account for the boundary conditions correctly. For example, if you are iterating over a list of elements, make sure that you check for the end of the list before you try to access the next element. If you make an off-by-one error, the program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.
* **Memory leaks:** Make sure that you free any allocated memory when you are done with it. If you do not free the memory, the program will eventually run out of memory and crash.
* **Synchronization issues:** If your program is multi-threaded, make sure that you synchronize access to shared resources correctly. If you do not synchronize access to shared resources, the program may produce incorrect results or crash.
* **Race conditions:** If your program is multi-threaded, make sure that you avoid race conditions. A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same shared resource at the same time. If a race condition occurs, the program may produce incorrect results or crash.
* **Deadlocks:** If your program is multi-threaded, make sure that you avoid deadlocks. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. If a deadlock occurs, the program will eventually stop running.
* **Uncaught exceptions:** Make sure that you catch and handle all exceptions that your program may throw. If you do not catch and handle an exception, the program will crash.

CODEFORCES 1375_A. Sign Flipping

Pain points:
**1. Not handling the case where all numbers are equal.**

In the problem statement, it is mentioned that `n is odd`, but the example input has a test case with `n = 3`. If all numbers are equal, then there is no way to flip signs so that `(n - 1) / 2` of the adjacent differences are non-negative and `(n - 1) / 2` of the adjacent differences are non-positive.

**2. Not handling the case where all numbers are negative.**

In the problem statement, it is mentioned that `a_i >= -10^9`, but the example input has a test case with `a_i = -10^9`. If all numbers are negative, then there is no way to flip signs so that `(n - 1) / 2` of the adjacent differences are non-negative and `(n - 1) / 2` of the adjacent differences are non-positive.

**3. Not handling the case where all numbers are positive.**

In the problem statement, it is mentioned that `a_i <= 10^9`, but the example input has a test case with `a_i = 10^9`. If all numbers are positive, then there is no way to flip signs so that `(n - 1) / 2` of the adjacent differences are non-negative and `(n - 1) / 2` of the adjacent differences are non-positive.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1466_I. The Riddle of the Sphinx

Pain points:
### 1. **Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are following the format exactly. Some common mistakes include:

* Not including the two integers `n` and `b` on the first line.
* Not including the `yes` or `no` answer from the interactor on a new line.
* Not flushing the output after each query.

If you make any of these mistakes, you will likely get an incorrect verdict from the judge.

### 2. **Not using the interactor correctly**

The interactor for this problem is adaptive, which means that it will change its behavior based on your previous queries. It is important to understand how the interactor works and to use it correctly. Some common mistakes include:

* Asking a question about an index that is out of bounds.
* Asking a question about a value that is too large.
* Asking the same question multiple times.

If you make any of these mistakes, the interactor may give you incorrect answers, or it may even crash.

### 3. **Not using binary search efficiently**

The main idea behind the solution to this problem is to use binary search to find the maximum value in the array. However, it is important to use binary search efficiently in order to avoid running out of time. Some common mistakes include:

* Not initializing the left and right pointers correctly.
* Not updating the left and right pointers correctly after each iteration of the binary search loop.
* Not terminating the binary search loop when you have found the maximum value.

If you make any of these mistakes, your binary search algorithm may not terminate in time, or it may even give you the wrong answer.

### 4. **Not handling the corner cases correctly**

There are a few corner cases that you need to be aware of when solving this problem. Some common mistakes include:

* Not handling the case where the array is empty.
* Not handling the case where the maximum value is 0.
* Not handling the case where the maximum value is 2^b-1.

If you do not handle these corner cases correctly, your solution may not be correct.

### 5. **Not debugging your code thoroughly**

Once you have written your solution, it is important to debug it thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. Some common mistakes that you may make when debugging your code include:

* Not using a debugger.
* Not using unit tests.
* Not running your code on a variety of input data.

If you do not debug your code thoroughly, you may not find any of the errors that are present in your code. This could lead to you submitting an incorrect solution, or it could even lead to you getting a runtime error during the contest.

CODEFORCES 1491_C. Pekora and Trampoline

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input format is not clear. Is the first line of each test case the number of trampolines or the number of test cases?
* The output format is not clear. Is the output the number of passes or the number of trampolines?
* The problem statement is not clear. What does it mean to "reduce all S_i to 1"?
* The example is not clear. What is the optimal series of passes in the first test case?
* The solution is not correct. The solution for the first test case should be 3, not 4.

Here are some possible solutions to these problems and bugs:

* The input format can be fixed by specifying that the first line of each test case contains the number of trampolines.
* The output format can be fixed by specifying that the output is the number of passes.
* The problem statement can be fixed by specifying that Pekora needs to reduce all S_i to 1 by jumping on trampolines.
* The example can be fixed by providing a more detailed explanation of the optimal series of passes in the first test case.
* The solution can be fixed by correctly counting the number of passes in the first test case.

Title:
CODEFORCES 471_A. MUH and Sticks

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be a single line containing six space-separated integers. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be either "Bear", "Elephant", or "Alien". If the output format is incorrect, the program will get a wrong answer.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When comparing the lengths of the sticks, it is easy to make a mistake and compare the sticks in the wrong order. This can lead to the program incorrectly identifying the animal that can be made from the sticks.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The logic for determining which animal can be made from the sticks is not always straightforward. It is important to make sure that the logic is correct, or the program will get a wrong answer.
5. **Memory leaks**. The program should not allocate any memory that it does not need. If the program allocates memory that it does not need, it will eventually run out of memory and crash.
6. **Synchronization issues**. If the program is multi-threaded, it is important to ensure that the threads are synchronized properly. If the threads are not synchronized properly, the program can produce incorrect results or crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 495_B. Modular Equations

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modular arithmetic.** When working with modular arithmetic, it is important to be careful about the order of operations. For example, `a % b + c` is not the same as `(a % b) + c`. In the first case, the remainder of `a / b` is added to `c`, while in the second case, the remainder of `(a + c) / b` is taken.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When working with modular arithmetic, it is important to be careful about off-by-one errors. For example, if you are looking for the smallest positive integer `x` such that `x % n = 0`, you need to make sure that `x >= 0`.
3. **Modular inverses.** When working with modular arithmetic, it is important to be able to find modular inverses. A modular inverse of a number `a` modulo `n` is a number `b` such that `a * b % n = 1`. Modular inverses can be found using the extended Euclidean algorithm.
4. **Infinite solutions.** Some modular equations have an infinite number of solutions. For example, the equation `x % 2 = 0` has an infinite number of solutions, since any even number is a solution.
5. **Wrong input format.** The input for this problem is given in the format `a b`, where `a` and `b` are two integers. It is important to make sure that the input is formatted correctly.
6. **Runtime errors.** The code for this problem should be written in a way that it runs in a reasonable amount of time. For example, the code should not use an iterative approach to find the modular inverse of a number, since this would take a very long time.
7. **Memory errors.** The code for this problem should be written in a way that it does not use too much memory. For example, the code should not create a large array to store all of the solutions to the equation.

2. **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correctly specified. For example, the output may not have the correct number of lines, or the values in the output may not be in the correct format.
3. **Incorrect algorithm:** The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not terminate, or it may not produce the correct output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 546_A. Soldier and Bananas

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain three integers, but the input may contain a different number of integers. For example, the input `3 17 4 5` would be incorrect because it contains four integers instead of three.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the output should be a single integer, but the output may contain multiple integers or non-integer values. For example, the output `13 4` would be incorrect because it contains two integers.
3. **Incorrect calculation.** The soldier's total cost for the bananas is `i * k`, where `i` is the number of bananas and `k` is the cost of each banana. However, the soldier may not have enough money to buy all of the bananas, so he may need to borrow money from his friend. The amount of money that the soldier must borrow is `i * k - n`, where `n` is the amount of money that the soldier has.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the soldier's total cost for the bananas, it is important to make sure that the index of the last banana is correct. For example, if the soldier wants to buy 4 bananas and each banana costs $3, then the total cost is `4 * 3 = 12` dollars. However, if the index of the last banana is incorrectly calculated as `4 - 1 = 3`, then the total cost will be calculated as `3 * 3 = 9` dollars, which is incorrect.
5. **Memory errors.** If the soldier's total cost for the bananas is too large, then the program may run out of memory. This can be avoided by using a more efficient algorithm or by reducing the size of the input data.
6. **Timeout errors.** If the program takes too long to run, then it may be terminated by the judge. This can be avoided by using a more efficient algorithm or by reducing the size of the input data.

Title:
CODEFORCES 572_C. Lengthening Sticks

Pain points:
### 1. **Incorrect input format**

The input format is specified in the problem statement. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to process the input and will produce an incorrect output.

For example, if the input is in the following format:

```
1 2 3 4
```

the program will not be able to process the input because it is missing the last integer, which is the length of the longest stick.

### 2. **Incorrect output format**

The output format is also specified in the problem statement. If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to produce the correct output.

For example, if the output is in the following format:

```
1 2 3
```

the program will not be able to produce the correct output because it is not a single integer.

### 3. **Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve the problem must be correct in order to produce the correct output. If the algorithm is incorrect, the program will produce an incorrect output.

For example, the following algorithm is incorrect:

```
def solve(a, b, c, l):
  # This algorithm is incorrect because it does not consider the case where all three sticks are the same length.
  if a == b == c:
    return 0

  # This algorithm is also incorrect because it does not consider the case where the longest stick is longer than the sum of the other two sticks.
  if a + b + c <= l:
    return 1

  # This algorithm is also incorrect because it does not consider the case where the longest stick is shorter than the sum of the other two sticks, but the total length of the sticks is less than l.
  if a + b + c < l:
    return 0

  # This algorithm is also incorrect because it does not consider the case where the longest stick is shorter than the sum of the other two sticks, but the total length of the sticks is greater than l.
  if a + b + c > l:
    return 0

  # This algorithm is also incorrect because it does not consider the case where the longest stick is equal to the sum of the other two sticks.
  if a + b + c == l:
    return 2

  # This algorithm is also incorrect because it does not consider the case where the longest stick is greater than the sum of the other two sticks, but the total length of the sticks is equal to l.
  if a + b + c == l:
    return 1

  # This algorithm is also incorrect because it does not consider the case where the longest stick is greater than the sum of the other two sticks, but the total length of the sticks is greater than l.
  if a + b + c > l:
    return 0

  # This algorithm is also incorrect because it does not consider the case where the longest stick is equal to the sum of the other two sticks, but the total length of the sticks is less than l.
  if a + b + c < l:
    return 0

  # This algorithm is also incorrect because it does not consider the case where the longest stick is less than the sum of the other two sticks, but the total length of the sticks is greater than l.
  if a + b + c > l:
    return 0

  # This algorithm is also incorrect because it does not consider the case where the longest stick is greater than the sum of the other two sticks, but the total length of the sticks is less than l.

CODEFORCES 594_A. Warrior and Archer

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is `n x1 x2 ... xn`, where `n` is the number of positions, and `x1, x2, ..., xn` are the coordinates of the positions. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will produce an incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output for this problem should be a single integer, which is the distance between the warrior and the archer at the beginning of the fight. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be accepted by the judge.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve this problem must be correct in order to produce the correct output. If the algorithm is incorrect, the program will produce an incorrect output.
4. **Memory limit exceeded**. The program must not exceed the memory limit specified by the judge. If the program exceeds the memory limit, it will be terminated and the output will be incorrect.
5. **Time limit exceeded**. The program must not exceed the time limit specified by the judge. If the program exceeds the time limit, it will be terminated and the output will be incorrect.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to use a correct algorithm and to ensure that the program does not exceed the memory or time limits.

Title:
CODEFORCES 615_D. Multipliers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct, so the developer should check if the input is in the correct format. For example, the input may contain a non-integer number, or the number of primes may be greater than 200000.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the product of divisors**. The product of divisors can be calculated in different ways. The developer should choose the most efficient way to calculate the product. For example, the product of divisors can be calculated using the following formula:

```
P = (p1 + 1) * (p2 + 1) * ... * (pm + 1)
```

where pi are the prime factors of n.
3. **Incorrect modulo operation**. The modulo operation is a common source of errors. The developer should make sure that the modulo operation is performed correctly. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
a = 1000000007
b = 1000000008
print(a % b)
```

The correct code should be:

```
a = 1000000007
b = 1000000008
print(a % b + 1000000007)
```

4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correct, so the developer should check if the output is in the correct format. For example, the output may contain a non-integer number, or the number of primes may be greater than 200000.

Title:
CODEFORCES 634_F. Orchestra

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Off-by-one errors.** The input data is given in row-major order, so it is easy to make a mistake when computing the coordinates of a rectangle. For example, if the input is `3 2 3 2`, and the violas are located at `(1, 1)`, `(3, 1)`, and `(2, 2)`, then the rectangle with the smallest area that contains all three violas is `(1, 1) - (3, 2)`, not `(1, 1) - (2, 2)`.
2. **Incorrect handling of duplicate violas.** The input data guarantees that no location appears more than once, but it is possible for two or more violas to be located in the same row or column. In this case, the correct solution is to count each viola only once.
3. **Incorrect handling of empty rectangles.** If there are no violas in the orchestra, then the answer is 0.
4. **Incorrect handling of invalid input.** The input data is guaranteed to be valid, but it is possible for a developer to make a mistake when reading the input data. For example, if the input is `3 2 3 4`, then the number of violas is greater than the minimum number of violas required, so the answer is 0.
5. **Incorrect use of floating-point arithmetic.** The problem statement does not specify the precision of the input data, so it is possible for a developer to make a mistake when using floating-point arithmetic. For example, if the input is `3 2 3 2.5`, then the minimum number of violas required is 3, not 2.5.

**Additional tips for solving this problem:**

* Use a greedy algorithm to find the smallest rectangle that contains all of the violas.
* Use a hash table to keep track of the locations of the violas.
* Use a priority queue to keep track of the rectangles in decreasing order of area.
* Use a binary search to find the smallest rectangle that contains all of the violas.

CODEFORCES 688_B. Lovely Palindromes

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type to store the input number.** If the input number is large, it may overflow the data type used to store it. This can lead to incorrect results or even a program crash.
2. **Using an incorrect algorithm to find the nth even-length palindrome number.** There are many different algorithms that can be used to find palindrome numbers. Some algorithms are more efficient than others, and some are more likely to find the nth even-length palindrome number than others.
3. **Incorrectly handling edge cases.** There are a few edge cases that need to be handled when finding the nth even-length palindrome number. For example, what if n is 1? What if n is larger than the largest even-length palindrome number?
4. **Using incorrect output formatting.** The output of the program should be the nth even-length palindrome number. Make sure that the output is formatted correctly, and that it is easy to read.
5. **Using incorrect error handling.** If the program encounters an error, it should handle the error gracefully. For example, the program should print an error message and exit if the input number is not valid.

Title:
CODEFORCES 710_A. King Moves

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be in the format "cd", where `c` is the column from `'a'` to `'h'` and `d` is the row from `'1'` to `'8'`. If the input is not in the correct format, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer, which is the number of moves permitted for the king. If the output is not in the correct format, the program will not compile.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When checking the king's possible moves, it is important to make sure that you are checking the correct squares. For example, if the king is in the position `e4`, it can move to the squares `e3`, `e5`, `d4`, `f4`, `d5`, `f5`, `d6`, and `f6`. If you accidentally check the squares `e2`, `e6`, `d3`, `f3`, `d7`, `f7`, `d8`, and `f8`, the program will output the wrong answer.
4. **Memory errors.** If the program does not properly manage its memory, it can crash or produce incorrect results. For example, if the program allocates too much memory, it may crash. If the program does not free up memory that it is no longer using, it may eventually run out of memory and crash.
5. **Synchronization errors.** If multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time, it is possible for them to corrupt the data or produce incorrect results. For example, if two threads are both trying to update the same variable, it is possible for one thread to overwrite the other thread's changes.
6. **Security vulnerabilities.** If the program is not properly secure, it may be vulnerable to attacks. For example, if the program allows users to input arbitrary data, it is possible for an attacker to inject malicious code into the program.
7. **Performance problems.** The program may be slow or inefficient if it is not properly optimized. For example, if the program uses a brute-force algorithm to solve a problem, it may take a very long time to run.

CODEFORCES 731_A. Night at the Museum

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input string may not be a valid lowercase English string. For example, it may contain digits or non-alphabetic characters.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer representing the minimum number of rotations required to print the input string.
3. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm used to find the minimum number of rotations may be incorrect. For example, it may not take into account the fact that the wheel can be rotated in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** The algorithm may incorrectly count the number of rotations required to print the input string. For example, it may count the number of rotations required to move from the letter 'a' to the letter 'z' as 26, when it is actually 25.
5. **Memory errors.** The algorithm may use too much memory, which can lead to a stack overflow or a segmentation fault.
6. **Time complexity.** The algorithm may take too long to run, which can be a problem if the input string is large.
7. **Space complexity.** The algorithm may use too much space, which can be a problem if the input string is large.

Title:
CODEFORCES 755_C. PolandBall and Forest

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of this problem is:

```
n
p1, p2, ..., pn
```

where `n` is the number of balls and `pi` is the id of the most distant relative of ball `i`.

If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to process the input correctly and may produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of this problem is:

```
k
```

where `k` is the number of trees in the forest.

If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce correct output.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic of the program should be correct in order to produce correct output.

For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
n = int(input())
p = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Find the number of trees in the forest.
k = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        if p[i] == p[j]:
            k += 1

print(k)
```

This code is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that a ball may have multiple most distant relatives.

The correct logic is as follows:

```
n = int(input())
p = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Find the number of trees in the forest.
k = 0
for i in range(n):
    # Find all of the balls that are most distant from ball i.
    most_distant_balls = set()
    for j in range(n):
        if p[i] == p[j]:
            most_distant_balls.add(j)

    # If there is only one ball that is most distant from ball i, then it is a tree.
    if len(most_distant_balls) == 1:
        k += 1

print(k)
```

**4. Memory errors**

The program should be careful not to allocate too much memory, as this could lead to a memory error.

For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
n = int(input())
p = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Find the number of trees in the forest.
k = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        if p[i] == p[j]:
            k += 1

print(k)
```

This code is incorrect because it creates a new list `most_distant_balls` for each ball `i`. This can lead to a memory error if `n` is large.

The correct logic is as follows:

```
n = int(input())
p = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Find the number of trees in the forest.
k = 0
most_distant_balls = set()
for i in range(n):
    # Find all of the balls that are most distant from ball i.
    if p[i] in most_distant_balls:
        k += 1
    else:
        most_distant_balls.add(p[i])

print(k)
```

This code uses a single set `most_distant_balls` to store all of the balls that are most distant from any ball. This prevents the creation of a new list for each ball, which can help to avoid memory errors.

**5. Runtime errors**

The program should be careful not to take too long to run, as this could lead to a runtime error.

For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
n = int(input())
p = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Find the number of trees in the forest.
k = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        if p[i] == p[j]:
            k += 1

print(k)
```

This code is incorrect because it iterates over all pairs of balls, which can take a long time if `n` is large.

The correct logic is as follows:

```
n = int(input())
p = list(map(int
Test inputs:

    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        if p[i] == p[j]:
            k += 1

print(k)
```

This code is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that a ball may have multiple most distant relatives.

The correct logic is as follows:

```

p = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Find the number of trees in the forest.
k = 0
for i in range(n):
    # Find all of the balls that are most distant from ball i.
    most_distant_balls = set()
    for j in range(n):
        if p[i] == p[j]:
            most_distant_balls.add(j)

    # If there is only one ball that is most distant from ball i, then it is a tree.
    if len(most_distant_balls) == 1:
        k += 1

print(k)
```

### Memory errors

The following program input is incorrect because it can lead to a memory error:

```
n = int(input())
p = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Find the number of trees in the forest.
k = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        if p[i] == p[j]:
            k += 1

print(k)
```

This code is incorrect because it creates a new list `most_distant_balls` for each ball `i`. This can lead to a memory error if `n` is large.

The correct logic is as follows:

```
n = int(input())
p = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Find the number of trees in the forest.
k = 0
most_distant_balls = set()
for i in range(n):
    # Find all of the balls that are most distant from ball i.
    if p[i] in most_distant_balls:
        k += 1
    else:
        most_distant_balls.add(p[i])

print(k)
```

This code uses a single set `most_distant_balls` to store all of the balls that are most distant from any ball. This prevents the creation of a new list for each ball, which can help to avoid memory errors.

### Runtime errors

The following program input is incorrect because it can lead to a runtime error:

```
n = int(input())
p = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Find the number of trees in the forest.
k = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        if p[i] == p[j]:
            k += 1

print(k)
```

This code is incorrect because it iterates over all pairs of balls, which can take a long time if `n` is large.

The correct logic is as follows:

```
n = int(input())
p = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Find the number of trees in the forest.
k = 0
for i in range(n):
    # Find the ball that is most distant from ball i.
    most_distant_ball = p[i

CODEFORCES 776_D. The Door Problem

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of rooms is not a positive integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program does not check if all doors are unlocked after toggling all switches, it will output the wrong answer.
3. **Memory leaks**. The program may not properly free up memory after it is no longer needed, which can lead to a memory leak. This can eventually cause the program to crash.
4. **Race conditions**. If multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time, it is possible for them to overwrite each other's data, which can lead to errors.
5. **Deadlocks**. If two threads are waiting for each other to finish, they can deadlock, which means that neither thread can continue. This can also lead to the program crashing.
6. **Buffer overflows**. If the program writes data to a buffer that is not large enough, it can overwrite other data in memory, which can lead to errors.
7. **Format errors**. The program may not output the results in the correct format, which can make it difficult to interpret the results.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may be vulnerable to attacks, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting. This can allow attackers to access sensitive data or take control of the program.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design and test the program. It is also important to use a programming language that is designed to be safe, such as Java or Python.

CODEFORCES 7_E. Defining Macros

Pain points:
**Possible Problems and Bugs**

* **Incorrect macro definition:** The macro definition may not be valid. For example, the macro definition may not contain any expression, or the expression may be invalid.
* **Incorrect macro substitution:** The macro substitution may not be performed correctly. For example, the macro substitution may not replace all occurrences of the macro name, or the macro substitution may introduce new errors in the expression.
* **Suspicious expression:** The expression may be suspicious even if the macro substitution is performed correctly. For example, the expression may contain nested macros, or the expression may contain division by zero.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the macro definition and the expression before performing the macro substitution.

CODEFORCES 821_B. Okabe and Banana Trees

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem states that Okabe can select a single rectangle with axis aligned sides with all points on or under the line. This means that the rectangle must have a non-negative y-coordinate. However, some solutions incorrectly assume that the rectangle can have a negative y-coordinate.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for finding the maximum number of bananas that Okabe can get is relatively simple. However, some solutions incorrectly implement the algorithm, which can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect input handling.** The input for this problem is a pair of integers m and b. Some solutions incorrectly handle the input, which can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect output formatting.** The output for this problem should be a single integer. Some solutions incorrectly format the output, which can lead to errors.

2. The output format is not specified. Is it one line per increasing sequence? Or is it one line for all the increasing sequences?
3. The problem statement does not specify what to do if there are no unused numbers in the array. Should the program print an empty line? Or should it print an error message?
4. The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input array is not sorted. Should the program print an error message? Or should it try to sort the array and then print the increasing sequences?

CODEFORCES 868_D. Huge Strings

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specified in the problem statement is not followed. For example, if the input contains a string of length greater than 100, or if the number of operations is not a positive integer, the program will not work correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specified in the problem statement is not followed. For example, if the output contains a string of length greater than 100, or if the number of strings is not a positive integer, the program will not work correctly.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program may not be able to correctly solve the problem due to incorrect logic. For example, if the program does not take into account the fact that the strings may contain both 0s and 1s, it will not be able to correctly find the maximum length of a substring that contains all possible strings of length k.
4. **Memory errors**. The program may run out of memory if it is not properly designed. For example, if the program tries to store all of the strings in memory at once, it may run out of memory if the strings are too long.
5. **Time errors**. The program may take too long to run if it is not properly designed. For example, if the program uses a brute-force approach to solve the problem, it may take a very long time to run if the number of strings is large.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to design the program carefully and to test it thoroughly before submitting it.

CODEFORCES 894_A. QAQ

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of subsequences.** The most common mistake is to count the number of occurrences of the substring "QAQ" instead of the number of subsequences. To avoid this, make sure to only count each subsequence once.
2. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. The most efficient algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm, which takes O(n) time and O(1) space. Other algorithms, such as a brute-force algorithm, take O(n^2) time and O(n) space.
3. **Incorrectly handling the input data.** The input data is a string of length n, where n is a positive integer. Make sure to check that n is valid before proceeding with the solution. Additionally, make sure to handle the case where the input string is empty.
4. **Incorrectly handling the output data.** The output data is a single integer, which is the number of subsequences "QAQ" in the input string. Make sure to print the output data in the correct format.
5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:
    * Using incorrect variable names or types
    * Forgetting to initialize variables
    * Making logic errors in the code
    * Using incorrect data structures or algorithms
    * Not handling edge cases correctly

Title:
CODEFORCES 915_D. Almost Acyclic Graph

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect graph representation**. The graph is represented as an adjacency list, where each vertex is represented by a list of its adjacent vertices. However, the graph may contain self-loops, which are edges that connect a vertex to itself. This can lead to incorrect results, as self-loops can create cycles in the graph.
2. **Incorrect edge removal**. When removing an edge from the graph, it is important to make sure that the graph remains connected. This means that there must be at least one path from every vertex to every other vertex. If an edge is removed that disconnects the graph, then the graph will no longer be acyclic.
3. **Incorrect cycle detection**. A cycle in a directed graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. To detect a cycle in a graph, it is necessary to visit each vertex exactly once. This can be done using a depth-first search or a breadth-first search.
4. **Incorrect output**. The output of the program should be either "YES" or "NO". If the graph is acyclic, then the output should be "YES". If the graph is not acyclic, then the output should be "NO".

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use a directed graph representation that does not allow self-loops.
* Make sure that the graph remains connected when an edge is removed.
* Use a correct algorithm to detect cycles in the graph.
* Carefully check the output of the program to make sure that it is correct.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs that occur when solving this problem.

CODEFORCES 938_E. Max History

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The most common mistake is to forget to update the value of `M` when the condition `aM < ai` is met. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000 000`, but some solutions may not work correctly for arrays with a larger size. Additionally, the problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ ai ≤ 109`, but some solutions may not work correctly for arrays with values that are larger than this.
3. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic.** The problem statement specifies that the output should be modulo 109 + 7, but some solutions may not correctly handle this.
4. **Runtime errors.** Some solutions may not run in time for large inputs. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as inefficient algorithms, incorrect data structures, or excessive memory usage.
5. **Memory errors.** Some solutions may not allocate enough memory to store the intermediate results. This can lead to a segmentation fault or other runtime errors.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement, implement the algorithm correctly, handle edge cases correctly, use modulo arithmetic correctly, and optimize the solution for runtime and memory efficiency.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a non-integer number, or it may not contain the correct number of elements.
2. **Incorrect calculation of probabilities**. The probabilities of the chip moving to each of the four adjacent squares must add up to 1. If they do not, the expected time to move away from the origin will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the expected time**. The expected time to move away from the origin is a sum of the probabilities of each possible move, multiplied by the time it takes to move that distance. If this calculation is incorrect, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Modulo arithmetic error**. The output must be a number modulo 10^9 + 7. If this is not done correctly, the output will be incorrect.
5. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other possible bugs that could occur when solving this problem, such as incorrect variable initialization, incorrect logic, and incorrect use of functions.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to carefully check your calculations and make sure that they are correct. Finally, it is important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly on all possible inputs.

Title:
HACKEREARTH aqua-park

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not specified clearly. It is not clear whether the first line contains the initial X coordinate and the number of objects, or the initial X coordinate and the coordinates of the first object. This can lead to errors in parsing the input and incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The input data is not validated. This can lead to errors in parsing the input and incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program will crash.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not take into account all of the constraints on the input data. This can lead to incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not specified clearly. It is not clear whether the output should be a single integer or a list of integers. This can lead to errors in parsing the output and incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect error handling**

The program may not handle errors correctly. For example, if the input data is invalid, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

**6. Inefficient algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve the problem may be inefficient. This can lead to the program running slowly or using too much memory.

**7. Unclear code**

The code may be unclear and difficult to understand. This can make it difficult to debug and maintain the program.

**8. Lack of testing**

HACKEREARTH chandu-and-his-toy-stack

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly reading the input format**. The input format is not very clear, so it is easy to make mistakes when reading it. For example, you might think that the first line of input contains the number of test cases, when it actually contains the number of stacks.
2. **Not understanding the problem statement**. The problem statement is not very clear, so it is easy to make mistakes when trying to solve it. For example, you might think that you need to find the minimum number of toys that Chandu needs to add or remove, when you actually need to find the minimum total effort required.
3. **Using the wrong data structures**. The problem requires you to keep track of the heights of the stacks and the amount of effort required to add or remove toys. If you use the wrong data structures, you will not be able to solve the problem efficiently.
4. **Implementing the solution incorrectly**. The solution to this problem is not very straightforward, so it is easy to make mistakes when implementing it. For example, you might forget to take into account the fact that Chandu can only add or remove one toy at a time.
5. **Not testing your code**. It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it. This will help you to catch any bugs that you might have missed.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

1. **Read the input format carefully**. Make sure that you understand exactly what the input format is before you start reading the input.
2. **Understand the problem statement**. Make sure that you understand exactly what the problem is asking you to do before you start writing your solution.
3. **Use the right data structures**. Choose data structures that are appropriate for the problem you are trying to solve.
4. **Implement the solution carefully**. Make sure that you implement the solution correctly.
5. **Test your code thoroughly**. Test your code thoroughly before submitting it. This will help you to catch any bugs that you might have missed.

Title:
HACKEREARTH divide-array-2

Pain points:
**1. Using a list to store the input array**

This is a common mistake that many developers make when solving this problem. A list is a mutable data structure, which means that it can be changed after it has been created. This can lead to problems if the list is not properly initialized or if it is not used correctly.

For example, if you try to divide all the elements of a list by a constant, you will end up changing the values of all the elements in the list. This is not what you want to do, because you only want to divide the elements of the array by a constant once.

To avoid this problem, you should use a tuple to store the input array. A tuple is an immutable data structure, which means that it cannot be changed after it has been created. This will prevent you from accidentally changing the values of the elements in the array.

**2. Using the wrong data type for the input array**

Another common mistake that developers make when solving this problem is using the wrong data type for the input array. The input array is a list of integers, so you should use the `int` data type to store the elements of the array.

If you use a different data type, such as `float`, you will end up getting incorrect results. This is because the division operator (`/`) will perform floating-point division, which will round the results to the nearest decimal place. This can lead to errors if the results of the division are not whole numbers.

To avoid this problem, you should always use the `int` data type for the input array.

**3. Not using the `map()` function correctly**

The `map()` function is a very useful function for solving this problem. The `map()` function takes a function and a sequence as input and returns a new sequence where each element of the new sequence is the result of applying the function to the corresponding element of the original sequence.

For example, the following code uses the `map()` function to divide all the elements of a list by a constant:

```
def divide_by_constant(x):
  return x / constant

list_of_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
new_list = map(divide_by_constant, list_of_numbers)

print(new_list)
```

This code will print the following output:

```
[0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5]
```

The `map()` function is a very powerful tool, but it can be easy to misuse. One common mistake that developers make is to use the `map()` function with a function that returns a value that is not the same type as the elements of the original sequence.

For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
def divide_by_constant(x):
  return x / constant

list_of_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
new_list = map(divide_by_constant, list_of_numbers)

print(new_list)
```

This code will cause an error because the `divide_by_constant()` function returns a `float` value, but the elements of the `list_of_numbers` list are `int` values.

To avoid this problem, you should always make sure that the function that you pass to the `map()` function returns a value that is the same type as the elements of the original sequence.

**4. Not using the `reduce()` function correctly**

The `reduce()` function is another very useful function for solving this problem. The `reduce()` function takes a function and a sequence as input and returns a single value that is the result of applying the function to all the elements of the sequence.

For example, the following code uses the `reduce()` function to find the sum of a list of numbers:

```
def sum_numbers(x, y):
  return x + y

list_of_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sum_of_numbers = reduce(sum_numbers, list_of_numbers)

print(sum_of_numbers)
```

This code will print the following output:

```
15
```

The `reduce()` function is a very powerful tool, but it can be easy to misuse. One common mistake that developers make is to use the `reduce()` function with a function that returns a value that is not the same type as the elements of the original sequence.

For example, the

    a = list(map(lambda x: x / d, a))

```

**2. Using the wrong data type for the input array**

```
n = int(input())
a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
q = int(input())
for _ in range(q):
    d = int(input())
    a = [x / d for x in a]

```

**3. Not using the `map()` function correctly**

a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
q = int(input())
for _ in range(q):
    d = int(input())
    a = list(map(lambda x: x / d, a))

Title:
HACKEREARTH good-times-vs-bad-times-3

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. In the problem statement, we are told that a second is bad if all of the HH, MM, and SS at that second give 0 as a remainder when divided by the same prime number. However, if we incorrectly use the modulo operator, we may end up incorrectly counting some seconds as bad. For example, if we have a time of 23:46:23, and we incorrectly use the modulo operator to check if it is bad, we will get a remainder of 0 when we divide 23 by 23, 46 by 23, and 23 by 23. This will incorrectly lead us to believe that the second is bad, when it is actually good.
2. **Incorrect use of prime numbers.** The problem statement tells us that a second is bad if all of the HH, MM, and SS at that second give 0 as a remainder when divided by the same prime number. However, if we incorrectly use a prime number that is not actually prime, we may end up incorrectly counting some seconds as bad. For example, if we incorrectly use the number 4 as a prime number, we will incorrectly count the second 23:46:24 as bad, when it is actually good.
3. **Incorrect use of the 24-hour clock.** The problem statement tells us that the day starts at 00:00:00 and ends at 23:59:59. However, if we incorrectly use the 24-hour clock, we may end up incorrectly counting some seconds as bad. For example, if we incorrectly count the second 00:00:00 as bad, when it is actually good.
4. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. In the problem statement, we are told that a second is good if none of the HH, MM, and SS at that second is divisible by the same prime number. However, if we incorrectly use the modulo operator, we may end up incorrectly counting some seconds as good. For example, if we have a time of 23:46:23, and we incorrectly use the modulo operator to check if it is good, we will get a remainder of 0 when we divide 23 by 23, 46 by 23, and 23 by 23. This will incorrectly lead us to believe that the second is good, when it is actually bad.
5. **Incorrect use of the 60-second minute.** The problem statement tells us that the minute starts at 00:00 and ends at 59:59. However, if we incorrectly use the 60-second minute, we may end up incorrectly counting some seconds as good. For example, if we incorrectly count the second 00:00:01 as good, when it is actually bad.

For example, it is not clear whether the first line should contain the number of elements in the array or the size of the array. Additionally, it is not clear whether the second line should contain the elements of the array or their indices.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not clearly defined. For example, it is not clear whether the output should be a list of the elements of the array after the HIT operations or the sum of the elements of the array after the HIT operations.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic for the HIT operation is not clearly defined. For example, it is not clear whether the HIT operation should decrease the value of all the elements of the array that are greater than or equal to X by 1 or all the elements of the array that are greater than X by 1.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. The implementation of the solution may contain bugs. For example, the implementation may not correctly handle negative values or overflow.

HACKEREARTH monks-school-4

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for storing the students' ages.**

The problem statement specifies that the students' ages should be integers, but a developer might accidentally store them as strings. This would cause problems when trying to sort the students by age, as strings cannot be compared with integers.

**2. Forgetting to sort the students by age.**

Even if the students' ages are stored as integers, they will not be sorted by default. A developer must explicitly sort the students by age before printing them out.

**3. Using the wrong data type for storing the teachers' names.**

The problem statement specifies that the teachers' names should be strings, but a developer might accidentally store them as integers. This would cause problems when trying to print the teachers' names, as integers cannot be displayed as text.

**4. Forgetting to print the teachers' names.**

The problem statement specifies that the teachers' names should be printed before the students' names. A developer might accidentally forget to print the teachers' names, which would make the output incorrect.

**5. Printing the students' names in the wrong order.**

The problem statement specifies that the students' names should be printed in alphabetical order. A developer might accidentally print the students' names in the wrong order, which would make the output incorrect.

**6. Printing the students' ages in the wrong order.**

The problem statement specifies that the students' ages should be printed in increasing order. A developer might accidentally print the students' ages in the wrong order, which would make the output incorrect.

Title:
HACKEREARTH power-of-two-4

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input array may contain very large numbers. So, we need to use a data type that can store such large numbers. For example, we can use `long` data type in C++ or `int64_t` data type in Python.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The naive algorithm for solving this problem is to iterate over all possible subsets of the array and check if the AND of all elements in the subset is a power of two. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(2^N), which is too slow for large values of N.

A more efficient algorithm is to use the following property:

> If the AND of two numbers is a power of two, then at least one of the numbers must be a power of two.

Using this property, we can reduce the time complexity of the algorithm to O(N).

**3. Incorrect implementation**

The implementation of the algorithm must be correct. For example, we need to make sure that we check all possible subsets of the array and that we correctly check if the AND of all elements in the subset is a power of two.

**4. Insufficient testing**

It is important to test the algorithm thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. We can test the algorithm on a variety of inputs, including inputs that are small, large, and difficult.

**5. Using incorrect or incomplete documentation**

The documentation for the algorithm should be clear and complete. It should include a description of the algorithm, its time complexity, and its correctness. The documentation should also include examples of how to use the algorithm.

HACKEREARTH sum-of-powers-6

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input and output constraints for this problem are very large, so it's important to use the correct data type to store the numbers. If you use a data type that is too small, you may get incorrect results.

**2. Using incorrect formulas**

The formulas for finding the sum of two perfect powers are not trivial, so it's important to make sure you're using the correct ones. If you use the wrong formulas, you'll get incorrect results.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement specifies that the input numbers must be non-negative, so you need to make sure to handle edge cases where the input number is negative. If you don't handle these edge cases, your code will crash.

**4. Not using efficient algorithms**

The problem statement specifies that the input numbers can be very large, so it's important to use efficient algorithms to solve the problem. If you use inefficient algorithms, your code will run very slowly.

**5. Not testing your code**

It's always important to test your code before you submit it to make sure it's working correctly. This is especially important for problems like this one, where the input numbers can be very large. If you don't test your code, you may not find bugs until it's too late.

Title:
ATCODER p02616 AtCoder Beginner Contest 173 - Multiplication 4

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect modulo operator

The modulo operator in Python is **%**. However, in this problem, we need to use **mod()** function.

```python
N, K = map(int, input().split())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = A[0]
for a in A[1:]:
    ans = (ans * a) % (10**9 + 7)

print(ans)
```

### 2. Using negative numbers

The problem states that the absolute value of each element is at most 10^9. However, we can still get negative numbers when multiplying them. For example, if we have `[1, -2]` and we choose `K=2`, the maximum product is `-2`.

To avoid this problem, we can first convert all the numbers to positive numbers by adding `10**9` to them. Then, we can use the modulo operator to get the answer.

```python
N, K = map(int, input().split())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

for a in A:
    a += 10**9

ans = A[0]
for a in A[1:]:
    ans = (ans * a) % (10**9 + 7)

print(ans)
```

### 3. Using too much memory

The problem states that the input size is at most `2 * 10^5`. However, if we naively store all the numbers in a list, we will need `2 * 10^5` bytes of memory. This is too much for a lot of systems.

To avoid this problem, we can use a heap data structure to store the numbers. A heap is a data structure that allows us to quickly find the largest element in a list. This means that we can only store the `K` largest elements in the heap, which will save a lot of memory.

```python
N, K = map(int, input().split())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

A += [10**9] * (K - len(A))

heapq.heapify(A)

ans = 1
for _ in range(K):
    ans = (ans * heapq.heappop(A)) % (10**9 + 7)

print(ans)
```

### 4. Using incorrect algorithm

The naive algorithm for this problem is to iterate over all possible subsets of size `K` and find the maximum product. However, this algorithm has a time complexity of `O(2^N)`, which is too slow for large values of `N`.

A better algorithm is to use dynamic programming. Dynamic programming allows us to find the maximum product of a subset of size `k` by using the maximum products of all subsets of size `k-1`. This algorithm has a time complexity of `O(N * K)`, which is much faster than the naive algorithm.

```python
N, K = map(int, input().split())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

dp = [[0] * (K + 1) for _ in range(N + 1)]

for i in range(N + 1):
    dp[i][0] = 1

for i in range(1, N + 1):
    for j in range(1, K + 1):
        if j <= i:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j - 1] * A[i - 1], dp[i - 1][j])

print(dp[N][K])

Title:
ATCODER p02747 Social Infrastructure Information Systems Division  Hitachi Programming Contest 2020 - Hitachi String

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly checking if the string contains the substring `hi`.** The most common mistake is to check if the string contains the substring `hi` using the `in` operator. However, this operator will also return `True` if the string contains the substring `h` or `i`. To correctly check for the substring `hi`, you can use the following code:

```
if 'hi' in s:
  # The string contains the substring 'hi'.
else:
  # The string does not contain the substring 'hi'.
```

2. **Incorrectly counting the number of occurrences of the substring `hi`.** Another common mistake is to incorrectly count the number of occurrences of the substring `hi`. The most common way to do this is to use the `count` method. However, this method will only return the number of times the substring `hi` appears **consecutively** in the string. To correctly count the number of occurrences of the substring `hi`, you can use the following code:

```
count = 0
for i in range(len(s) - 1):
  if s[i:i + 2] == 'hi':
    count += 1

# The number of occurrences of the substring 'hi' in the string.
```

3. **Using a non-deterministic algorithm.** The problem statement states that the input string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. This means that the string can only contain the characters `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `m`, `n`, `o`, `p`, `q`, `r`, `s`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`. However, the `in` operator and the `count` method do not work on non-ASCII characters. This means that if the input string contains any non-ASCII characters, the algorithm will not work correctly. To avoid this problem, you can use the following code to convert the input string to a lowercase ASCII string:

```
s = s.lower()
```

4. **Using an incorrect data type.** The problem statement states that the input string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. This means that the input string must be a string. However, if you accidentally use a different data type, such as a list or a tuple, the algorithm will not work correctly. To avoid this problem, you can use the following code to ensure that the input string is a string:

```
s = str(input())
```

5. **Using an incorrect variable name.** The problem statement states that the input string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. This means that the input string must be a valid variable name. However, if you accidentally use an invalid variable name, such as `12345`, the algorithm will not work correctly. To avoid this problem, you can use the following code to ensure that the input string is a valid variable name:

```
s = input()
```
Test inputs:
1. `hi`
2. `hihi`
3. `ha`

1. **Incorrect input type.** The input is given in the format of `a b x`, where `a`, `b`, and `x` are integers. However, if the input is not in the correct format, the program will crash. For example, if the input is `a b x`, where `a`, `b`, and `x` are strings, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output type.** The output should be a floating-point number in degrees. However, if the output is not a floating-point number, or if the output is not in degrees, the program will produce an incorrect answer. For example, if the output is `45`, the program will produce an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect calculation.** The program must correctly calculate the maximum angle in which the bottle can be tilted without spilling any water. However, if the program does not correctly calculate the maximum angle, the program will produce an incorrect answer. For example, if the program calculates the maximum angle to be `90`, the program will produce an incorrect answer.
4. **Off-by-one error.** The program must correctly account for the fact that the water will be spilled when the angle of the bottle exceeds `90 degrees`. However, if the program does not correctly account for this, the program will produce an incorrect answer. For example, if the program calculates the maximum angle to be `89 degrees`, the program will produce an incorrect answer.
5. **Floating-point error.** The program must correctly account for the fact that floating-point numbers are not exact. However, if the program does not correctly account for this, the program may produce an incorrect answer. For example, if the program calculates the maximum angle to be `45.0000000001`, the program will produce an incorrect answer.

Title:
ATCODER p03017 AtCoder Grand Contest 034 - Kenken Race

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect variable type**

The input is a string, but the variable `S` is declared as an integer. This will cause a type error.

**2. Incorrect comparison operator**

The problem states that `A < B` and `B < D`. However, the code compares `A < B` and `B > D`. This will always return `False`.

**3. Off-by-one error**

The code checks if `S[C - 1] == '.'` and `S[D - 1] == '.'`. However, the correct check should be `S[C - 2] == '.'` and `S[D - 2] == '.'`. This is because the characters in `S` are indexed from 0, not 1.

**4. Uninitialized variable**

The code uses the variable `i` without initializing it. This will cause the variable to have an undefined value, which can lead to unexpected results.

**5. Infinite loop**

The code contains a loop that will never terminate. This is because the condition of the loop is always `True`.

**6. Memory leak**

The code allocates memory for a string but never frees it. This will eventually lead to a memory leak.

**7. Security vulnerability**

The code does not properly validate user input. This could allow a malicious user to exploit the code and gain unauthorized access to the system.

Title:
ATCODER p03458 AtCoder Beginner Contest 086 - Checker

Pain points:
**1. Mismatch between input and output format**

The input format is given in the problem statement, but the output format is not. Make sure to check the output format carefully and make sure your code is outputting the correct format.

**2. Incorrect use of data types**

The problem statement specifies that the values of N, K, x_i, y_i, and c_i are integers. Make sure that you are using the correct data types for these values.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Be careful when doing arithmetic with the values of N, K, x_i, y_i, and c_i. It is easy to make a mistake and add or subtract one too many or too few.

**4. Undefined behavior**

The problem statement does not specify what should happen if the input is invalid. Make sure that your code handles invalid input gracefully.

**5. Memory leaks**

Make sure that your code does not leak memory. This can be a common problem when using dynamic memory allocation.

**6. Race conditions**

If your code is multi-threaded, make sure to take care to avoid race conditions. This can be a difficult problem to debug, so it is best to avoid it altogether.

**7. Deadlocks**

If your code is multi-threaded, make sure to take care to avoid deadlocks. This can be a difficult problem to debug, so it is best to avoid it altogether.

**8. Security vulnerabilities**

Make sure that your code does not contain any security vulnerabilities. This can be a serious problem, as it could allow attackers to exploit your code to gain unauthorized access to your system.

**9. Bugs in third-party libraries**

If you are using third-party libraries, make sure that you are aware of any bugs in those libraries. These bugs could cause your code to malfunction, so it is important to be aware of them and to take steps to mitigate their impact.

Title:
ATCODER p03777 AtCoder Beginner Contest 056 - HonestOrDishonest

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly comparing the values of `a` and `b`.** The problem states that `a` and `b` are either `H` or `D`, but a developer may accidentally compare them as integers, which would result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Using the wrong operator to compare the values of `a` and `b`.** The problem states that `a` and `b` are either `H` or `D`, so they should be compared using the `==` operator. Using the `!=` operator would result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrectly using the `if` statement.** The `if` statement should be used to check whether the value of `a` is equal to the value of `b`. If the values are equal, the `if` statement should print `H`. If the values are not equal, the `if` statement should print `D`.
4. **Using the wrong variable to print the output.** The output should be printed using the variable `b`. Using the variable `a` would result in an incorrect answer.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Be careful when comparing the values of `a` and `b`. Make sure that you are using the correct operator and that you are comparing the values correctly.
* Use the `if` statement correctly. Make sure that you are checking whether the value of `a` is equal to the value of `b`.
* Use the correct variable to print the output. Make sure that you are using the variable `b` to print the output.

Title:
AIZU p00326 Scheduler

Pain points:
**Possible Problems and Bugs**

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect dependencies**. The dependencies between tasks must be acyclic. This means that there cannot be a path from a task to itself. If there is a cycle in the dependencies, the program will not be able to find a valid schedule.
3. **Incorrect evaluation order**. The evaluation order must be a permutation of the integers from 1 to K. This means that each integer must appear exactly once in the evaluation order. If the evaluation order is not a permutation, the program will not be able to find a valid schedule.
4. **Incorrect number of tasks**. The number of tasks must be greater than or equal to 2. If the number of tasks is less than 2, the program will not be able to find a valid schedule.
5. **Incorrect number of attributes**. The number of attributes must be greater than or equal to 1. If the number of attributes is less than 1, the program will not be able to find a valid schedule.
6. **Incorrect number of dependencies**. The number of dependencies must be greater than or equal to 0. If the number of dependencies is less than 0, the program will not be able to find a valid schedule.
7. **Incorrect number of evaluation order changes**. The number of evaluation order changes must be greater than or equal to 0. If the number of evaluation order changes is less than 0, the program will not be able to find a valid schedule.
8. **Incorrect number of tasks completed**. The number of tasks completed must be greater than or equal to 0. If the number of tasks completed is less than 0, the program will not be able to find a valid schedule.
9. **Incorrect evaluation order after change**. The evaluation order after a change must be a permutation of the integers from 1 to K. This means that each integer must appear exactly once in the evaluation order. If the evaluation order after a change is not a permutation, the program will not be able to find a valid schedule.
10. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the output will be invalid.

Title:
AIZU p00683 A Simple Offline Text Editor

Pain points:
^l

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly handling the input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it is easy to make mistakes when parsing it. For example, you might forget to account for the newline character at the end of each line, or you might misidentify the type of a command.
* **Incorrectly implementing the editing commands.** The editing commands in this problem are all relatively simple, but it is important to implement them correctly. For example, you need to make sure that the cursor is moved to the correct position after each command, and that any deleted characters are actually removed from the text buffer.
* **Incorrectly handling the text buffer.** The text buffer in this problem can contain at most 1,000 characters. If you try to insert more than 1,000 characters into the buffer, you will either overwrite existing characters or cause the program to crash.
* **Incorrectly handling the cursor.** The cursor in this problem can be in one of three positions: at the beginning of the text, at the end of the text, or between two characters in the text. It is important to make sure that the cursor is always in a valid position, and that it is moved to the correct position after each command.

By carefully avoiding these problems and bugs, you can write a program that successfully solves the A Simple Offline Text Editor problem.

2. The output format is not strictly specified. For example, it is not clear whether the output should be capitalized or not. This could lead to problems if the output is not formatted correctly.
3. The program does not handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input is invalid, the program will crash. This could lead to problems if the input is not valid.
4. The program is not very efficient. For example, it uses a nested loop to check for deadlocks. This could lead to problems if the input is large.
5. The program does not use any unit tests. This could lead to problems if the program is not working correctly.

To avoid these problems, the following steps can be taken:

1. The input format should be strictly specified. For example, the input should always end with a newline character.
2. The output format should be strictly specified. For example, the output should always be capitalized.
3. The program should handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input is invalid, the program should print an error message and exit.
4. The program should be more efficient. For example, it should use a more efficient algorithm to check for deadlocks.
5. The program should use unit tests. This will help to ensure that the program is working correctly.

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line of input is the number of datasets, followed by T datasets. However, if the number of datasets is 0, the input format is not met.
2. **Incorrect number of cards.** The input format specifies that each dataset consists of two lines, the first line is given the number ni of the i-th (i = 1, 2, ..., 9) card, each separated by a space, and the second line is i. The letters ci representing the color of the second card are given, separated by spaces. The number ni on the card is an integer that satisfies 1 ≤ ni ≤ 9, and the color ci on the card is one of the letters "` R` "," `G`", and "` B` ", respectively. However, if the number of cards is not 9, the input format is not met.
3. **Duplicate cards.** The input format specifies that no more than 5 cards with the same color and number will appear in one dataset. However, if there are more than 5 cards with the same color and number, the input format is not met.
4. **Incorrect card values.** The input format specifies that the number ni on the card is an integer that satisfies 1 ≤ ni ≤ 9. However, if the number ni is not an integer between 1 and 9, the input format is not met.
5. **Incorrect card colors.** The input format specifies that the color ci on the card is one of the letters "` R` "," `G`", and "` B` ". However, if the color ci is not one of these letters, the input format is not met.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input format and ensure that it is met. The developer should also check the number of cards, the card values, and the card colors to ensure that they are correct.

AIZU p01541 hosonagaitokoro

Pain points:
### Possible Problems and Bugs

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain a carriage speed that is not an integer, or the number of carriages may be negative. The program should be able to handle these cases gracefully and output an error message.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum time**. The minimum time is the time it takes for all carriages to arrive at the goal point in one line. The program should be able to calculate this time correctly, even if the carriages are not all traveling at the same speed.
3. **Incorrect use of the "slightly wide areas"**. The "slightly wide areas" can be used to allow carriages to overtake each other. The program should be able to use these areas correctly to minimize the total time.
4. **Incorrect handling of ties**. In some cases, there may be multiple ways to minimize the total time. The program should be able to handle these ties correctly and output the same minimum time for all possible solutions.
5. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be in the format specified in the problem statement. The program should be able to output the minimum time in minutes.

### Solutions to Potential Problems

1. **Incorrect input format**. The program can check the input format for errors before processing it. If an error is found, the program can output an error message and terminate.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum time**. The program can use a brute-force approach to calculate the minimum time. This involves calculating the time for each possible combination of carriage speeds and slightly wide areas. The minimum time is the smallest time that is found.
3. **Incorrect use of the "slightly wide areas"**. The program can use a greedy algorithm to use the "slightly wide areas" to minimize the total time. This involves choosing the "slightly wide areas" that allow the carriages to overtake each other in the most efficient way.
4. **Incorrect handling of ties**. The program can use a random number generator to break ties. This ensures that the same minimum time is output for all possible solutions.
5. **Incorrect output format**. The program can use the `printf()` function to output the minimum time in minutes. The output should be in the format specified in the problem statement.

Pain points:
1. The input format is not well-defined. For example, what if the input is "(() [8] ()) [5] (((() [2] ()) [6] (() [3] ())) [1] ()) (()[4] ()) [3] (((() [2] ()) [1] ()) [8] (() [3] ()))"?
2. The output format is not well-defined. For example, what if the output is "(() [6] ()) [8] (((() [4] ()) [7] ()) [9] ()) (())"?
3. The problem statement is not clear. For example, what does "Mr. Misawa likes a tree with good cost performance, such as a small number of vertices and large numbers" mean?
4. The problem is not well-defined. For example, what if the input is "(() [8] ()) [5] (((() [2] ()) [6] (() [3] ())) [1] ()) (()[4] ()) [3] (((() [2] ()) [1] ()) [8] (() [3] ()))"?
5. The solution is not well-defined. For example, what if the input is "(() [8] ()) [5] (((() [2] ()) [6] (() [3] ())) [1] ()) (()[4] ()) [3] (((() [2] ()) [1] ()) [8] (() [3] ()))"?

Title:
AIZU p02123 Fissure Puzzle Hard

Pain points:
1. The input is not always valid. For example, if N is even, the input is invalid.
2. The output may not be unique. For example, in the following input, there are two possible outputs:
```
N = 3
A = ["oxx", "oxx", "ooo"]
```
One possible output is:
```
1
1
1
```
Another possible output is:
```
2
1
2
```
3. The output may not be lexicographically minimal. For example, in the following input, there are two possible outputs:
```
N = 3
A = ["oxx", "oxx", "ooo"]
```
One possible output is:
```
1
1
1
```
Another possible output is:
```
2
1
2
```
The first output is lexicographically smaller than the second output. However, the second output is more efficient because it requires fewer cells to be selected.
4. The output may not be possible to achieve. For example, in the following input, there is no way to select cells such that all of the cells in the grid are black:
```
N = 3
A = ["xxo", "xxx", "xxx"]
```
5. The output may not be correct. For example, in the following input, the output is incorrect:
```
N = 3
A = ["oxx", "xxx", "xxx"]
```
The correct output is:
```
-1
```
6. The code may be incorrect. For example, the following code is incorrect:
```
def solve(N, A):
  if N % 2 == 0:
    return -1
  for i in range(N):
    for j in range(N):
      if A[i][j] == "o":
        # This line is incorrect.
        A[i][j] = "x"
  return 1
```
The correct code is:
```
def solve(N, A):
  if N % 2 == 0:
    return -1
  for i in range(N):
    for j in range(N):
      if A[i][j] == "o":
        A[i][j] = "x"
  return 1

AIZU p02263 Stack

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect operator precedence.** The operators `+` and `-` have the same precedence, so they are evaluated from left to right. The operator `*` has higher precedence than `+` and `-`, so it is evaluated before them.
2. **Incorrect operands.** The operands of the operators `+` and `-` must be integers. The operands of the operator `*` must be non-negative integers.
3. **Incorrect number of operands.** The number of operands must be the same as the number of operators.
4. **Incorrect input format.** The input must be a valid expression. For example, the input `1 2 + 3 4 - *` is a valid expression, but the input `1 2 + 3 4 -` is not a valid expression because it is missing an operator.
5. **Memory errors.** The program may run out of memory if the input is too large.
6. **Stack overflow.** The program may crash if the input contains too many operators.
7. **Infinite loop.** The program may enter an infinite loop if the input is malformed.
Test inputs:
1 2 +
1 2 + 3 4 - *
1 2 + 3 *

Title:
AIZU p02411 Grading

Pain points:
F **1. The input format is not very clear.** It is not clear what the -1 represents. Does it mean that the student did not take the exam, or that the exam score is -1?
2. **The logic for calculating the grade is not very clear.** For example, what happens if the student's midterm and final exam scores are both below 30, but their makeup exam score is greater than or equal to 50?
3. **The output format is not very clear.** It is not clear what the different grades represent.
4. **The program does not handle invalid input gracefully.** For example, what happens if the input contains a negative number?
5. **The program does not handle the end of input gracefully.** What happens if the input ends with two -1s instead of three?
6. **The program is not very efficient.** It could be made more efficient by using a more efficient data structure to store the student data.
7. **The program is not very modular.** It could be made more modular by breaking it up into smaller functions.
8. **The program is not very well-tested.** It could be made more well-tested by writing more unit tests.
9. **The program does not follow the style guide.** It could be made to follow the style guide by making some minor changes to the code.
