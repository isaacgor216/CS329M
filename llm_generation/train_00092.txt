Pain points:
1. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program, which would result in incorrect output. For example, the developer may forget to add the previous two terms when calculating the next term in the series.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The developer may use the wrong data type to store the numbers in the series, which could lead to errors. For example, the developer may use a `int` data type to store a number that is too large, which would cause the program to overflow.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may make a mistake in the indexing of the terms in the series, which would result in an incorrect output. For example, the developer may start counting the terms from 0 instead of 1.
4. **Infinite loop**. The developer may accidentally create an infinite loop in the program, which would cause the program to run forever. For example, the developer may forget to add a condition to the loop that terminates the loop after a certain number of iterations.
5. **Memory leak**. The developer may create a memory leak in the program, which could eventually lead to the program running out of memory. For example, the developer may not free the memory that is allocated for the terms in the series.
6. **Syntax error**. The developer may make a mistake in the syntax of the program, which would prevent the program from compiling or running. For example, the developer may forget to close a bracket or quote.

Title:
CODECHEF guess

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The problem states that `N` and `M` are integers, but the code below assumes they are strings. This will cause a `TypeError` when the code tries to divide them.
2. **Incorrect calculation.** The code below calculates the probability that Alice will go by dividing the number of ways she can choose a number that makes the sum odd by the total number of possible ways she can choose a number. However, this calculation is incorrect because it ignores the fact that Bob can also choose a number that makes the sum odd.
3. **Off-by-one error.** The code below calculates the number of ways that Alice can choose a number that makes the sum odd by subtracting 1 from `N` and `M`. However, this calculation is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that Alice can choose the same number as Bob.

To fix these problems, we can do the following:

1. **Cast `N` and `M` to integers.**

```python
N = int(input())
M = int(input())
```

2. **Correct the calculation of the probability.**

```python
prob = (N + M - 2) / (N * M)
```

3. **Fix the off-by-one error.**

```python
prob = (N + M - 3) / (N * M)
```

With these changes, the code will correctly calculate the probability that Alice will go.

1. **Incorrect Modulo Operator**

The modulo operator is used to find the remainder of a division operation. In this problem, we need to find the remainder of `N * X` divided by `10^6 + 3`. However, if we simply use the modulo operator, we may get the wrong answer. For example, if `N = 1000000000` and `X = 2`, then `N * X = 2000000000`, which has a remainder of `0` when divided by `10^6 + 3`. However, the correct answer is `2`.

To avoid this problem, we can use the following formula:

```
(a * b) % c = (a % c) * (b % c) % c
```

In this case, we have `a = N`, `b = X`, and `c = 10^6 + 3`. So, the correct answer is:

```
(N % (10^6 + 3)) * (X % (10^6 + 3)) % (10^6 + 3)
```

2. **Incorrect Exponentiation Operator**

The exponentiation operator is used to raise a number to a power. In this problem, we need to find the value of `N * X` raised to the power of `N`. However, if we simply use the exponentiation operator, we may get the wrong answer. For example, if `N = 2` and `X = 3`, then `N * X = 6`. If we raise `6` to the power of `2`, we get `729`. However, the correct answer is `36`.

To avoid this problem, we can use the following formula:

```
(a ^ b) % c = ((a % c) ^ b) % c
```

In this case, we have `a = N * X`, `b = N`, and `c = 10^6 + 3`. So, the correct answer is:

```
(((N * X) % (10^6 + 3)) ^ N) % (10^6 + 3)
```

3. **Incorrect Multiplication Operator**

The multiplication operator is used to multiply two numbers together. In this problem, we need to find the value of `N * X`. However, if we simply use the multiplication operator, we may get the wrong answer. For example, if `N = 1000000000` and `X = 2`, then `N * X = 2000000000`. However, the correct answer is `2`.

To avoid this problem, we can use the following formula:

```
(a * b) % c = (a % c) * (b % c) % c
```

In this case, we have `a = N`, `b = X`, and `c = 10^6 + 3`. So, the correct answer is:

```
(N % (10^6 + 3)) * (X % (10^6 + 3)) % (10^6 + 3)
```

CODEFORCES 1016_C. Vasya And The Mushrooms

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is a little tricky. It is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer. If you output anything else, the program will not be able to correctly evaluate your solution.

**3. Undefined behavior**

The problem statement does not specify what should happen if Vasya visits a cell that does not contain any mushrooms. If you do not handle this case correctly, your program may produce incorrect results.

**4. Time complexity**

The time complexity of your solution should be O(n). If your solution is too slow, it will not be able to pass the time limit on the test cases.

**5. Memory usage**

The memory usage of your solution should be O(n). If your solution uses too much memory, it will not be able to pass the memory limit on the test cases.

**6. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm you use to solve this problem must be correct. If your algorithm is incorrect, your program will not be able to find the optimal solution.

**7. Incorrect implementation**

Even if you have a correct algorithm, you still need to implement it correctly in order to get the correct answer. There are many ways to implement an algorithm, and some implementations are more efficient than others. Make sure that your implementation is efficient enough to pass the time limit on the test cases.

Title:
CODEFORCES 103_C. Russian Roulette

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly. For example, if you are using `scanf` to read the input, you need to make sure that you are using the correct format specifiers.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also very specific. It is important to make sure that you are printing the output in the correct format. For example, you need to make sure that you are using the correct characters to represent bullets and empty slots.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

One common mistake that programmers make when solving problems is off-by-one errors. This is when you accidentally miss or add one element to a calculation. For example, if you are trying to find the index of the last element in an array, you might accidentally add one to the array size, which would cause you to miss the last element.

**4. Undefined behavior**

Undefined behavior is a term used to describe code that does not have a well-defined result. This can happen when you are using uninitialized variables, dereferencing null pointers, or dividing by zero. Undefined behavior can lead to unexpected results, so it is important to avoid it whenever possible.

**5. Memory leaks**

A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing. Memory leaks can be difficult to track down, so it is important to use tools like valgrind to help you find them.

**6. Race conditions**

A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same shared data at the same time. This can lead to unexpected results, such as data corruption or deadlocks. Race conditions can be difficult to avoid, so it is important to use tools like mutexes and semaphores to help you synchronize access to shared data.

**7. Deadlocks**

A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can prevent any of the threads from making progress, and the program will eventually crash. Deadlocks can be difficult to avoid, but you can use tools like deadlock detectors to help you find them.

**8. Buffer overflows**

A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold. This can overwrite adjacent memory locations, which can lead to data corruption or security vulnerabilities. Buffer overflows can be difficult to avoid, but you can use tools like bounds checking to help you prevent them.

**9. Integer overflows**

An integer overflow occurs when a program tries to store a number that is larger than the maximum value that an integer can represent. This can lead to unexpected results, such as data corruption or security vulnerabilities. Integer overflows can be difficult to avoid, but you can use tools like overflow checking to help you prevent them.

**10. Security vulnerabilities**

Security vulnerabilities are weaknesses in a program that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system. Security vulnerabilities can be caused by a variety of factors, such as incorrect input validation, insecure coding practices, and buffer overflows. It is important to take steps to protect your programs from security vulnerabilities.

CODEFORCES 1062_D. Fun with Integers

Pain points:
**1. The input may not be a valid integer.** For example, the input `"abc"` would not be a valid integer. The developer should check that the input is a valid integer before continuing with the rest of the program.
2. The input may be negative.** For example, the input `-1` would not be a valid integer. The developer should check that the input is non-negative before continuing with the rest of the program.
3. The input may be too large.** For example, the input `1000000000` would not be a valid integer. The developer should check that the input is less than or equal to `100000` before continuing with the rest of the program.
4. The developer may not correctly calculate the maximum score.** For example, the developer may incorrectly calculate the maximum score as `n` when the maximum score is actually `n + 1`. The developer should carefully check their calculations to make sure they are correct.
5. The developer may not correctly handle the case where no transformation is possible.** For example, the developer may incorrectly print `0` when the maximum score is actually `1`. The developer should carefully check their code to make sure it handles the case where no transformation is possible.

CODEFORCES 1084_C. The Fair Nut and String

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be a string of lowercase Latin letters. If the input is not in the correct format, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer that represents the number of strictly increasing sequences p_1, p_2, …, p_k, such that:
    * For each i (1 ≤ i ≤ k), s_{p_i} = 'a'.
    * For each i (1 ≤ i < k), there is such j that p_i < j < p_{i + 1} and s_j = 'b'.
    If the output is not in the correct format, the program will not be accepted by the judge.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of sequences**. The number of sequences can be calculated by using the following formula:

```
N = (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 2
```

where n is the number of occurrences of the letter 'b' in the string s. However, this formula only works if the string s does not contain any consecutive occurrences of the letter 'b'. If the string s does contain consecutive occurrences of the letter 'b', then the number of sequences will be less than the value calculated by the formula.
4. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic**. When calculating the number of sequences, it is important to use modulo arithmetic to ensure that the answer is always a positive integer. If modulo arithmetic is not used, the answer may be negative or greater than 10^9 + 7, which will cause the program to crash.
5. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:
    * Using the wrong data type to store the number of sequences.
    * Using an incorrect algorithm to calculate the number of sequences.
    * Making a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm.
    * Failing to handle special cases correctly.

By carefully following the instructions in the problem statement and avoiding the common pitfalls listed above, you can write a program that correctly solves this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1103_E. Radix sum

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the radix sum function.** The radix sum function should take two numbers as input and return a number that is the radix sum of the two input numbers. The radix sum of two numbers is calculated by adding the digits of the two numbers together modulo 10. For example, the radix sum of the numbers 5 and 6 is 11, because 5 + 6 = 11 and 11 % 10 = 1.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm for computing the number of ways to choose one of the integers from the array n times.** The algorithm for computing the number of ways to choose one of the integers from the array n times is a recursive algorithm. The base case of the algorithm is when n is equal to 1. In this case, the number of ways to choose one of the integers from the array n times is equal to 1. The recursive case of the algorithm is when n is greater than 1. In this case, the number of ways to choose one of the integers from the array n times is equal to the sum of the number of ways to choose one of the integers from the array n - 1 times, multiplied by the number of ways to choose one of the integers from the array that is the radix sum of the integers that were chosen in the previous step.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the modulo operation.** The modulo operation is used to calculate the remainder of a division. For example, the modulo of the number 10 divided by the number 3 is 1, because 10 / 3 = 3 with a remainder of 1. The modulo operation is used in the radix sum function to ensure that the radix sum of two numbers is always less than 10.
4. **Incorrect use of the 2^58 constant.** The 2^58 constant is used to represent the maximum value that can be stored in a 64-bit integer. The 2^58 constant is used in the output of the program to ensure that the output is always a valid 64-bit integer.
5. **Incorrect use of the bitwise operators.** The bitwise operators are used to perform bitwise operations on integers. For example, the bitwise AND operator (&) is used to perform a logical AND operation on two integers. The bitwise OR operator (|) is used to perform a logical OR operation on two integers. The bitwise XOR operator (^) is used to perform a logical XOR operation on two integers. The bitwise operators are used in the radix sum function to calculate the radix sum of two numbers.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. **Test your code thoroughly.** One of the best ways to avoid bugs is to test your code thoroughly. This means testing your code with a variety of different inputs and ensuring that your code produces the correct output for each input.
2. **Use a debugger.** A debugger can be a helpful tool for debugging your code. A debugger allows you to step through your code line by line and see how the values of your variables change as your code executes. This can help you identify errors in your code.
3. **Read the documentation carefully.** The documentation for the programming language and libraries that you are using can be a valuable resource for debugging your code. The documentation can provide you with information about the different functions and operators that are available, as well as how to use them correctly.
4. **Ask for help.** If you are struggling to debug your code, don't be afraid to ask for help. There are many online resources available, such as forums and Stack Overflow, where you can ask questions and get help from other programmers.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1131_E. String Multiplication

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect implementation of the string multiplication algorithm

The string multiplication algorithm described in the problem statement is not commutative, which means that the order of the strings matters. For example, the product of the strings "abc" and "de" is not the same as the product of the strings "de" and "abc". This can lead to incorrect results if the algorithm is not implemented correctly.

### 2. Incorrect calculation of the beauty of the string

The beauty of a string is defined as the length of the longest substring that consists of only one letter. However, it is possible to incorrectly calculate the beauty of a string if the algorithm does not take into account all possible substrings. For example, the string "abc" has a beauty of 3, but the algorithm might incorrectly calculate the beauty as 2 if it only considers the substrings "a" and "bc".

### 3. Memory leaks

The string multiplication algorithm can be implemented in a way that leads to memory leaks. This can occur if the algorithm does not properly free the memory that is allocated for the intermediate strings. Memory leaks can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.

### 4. Runtime errors

The string multiplication algorithm can be implemented in a way that leads to runtime errors. This can occur if the algorithm does not handle invalid input correctly. For example, the algorithm might crash if it is given a string that contains invalid characters.

### 5. Incorrect output

The string multiplication algorithm can be implemented in a way that leads to incorrect output. This can occur if the algorithm does not correctly handle all possible cases. For example, the algorithm might incorrectly output the beauty of a string if the string contains duplicate letters.

2. **Incorrect variable name**. The variable `n` is used to store the number of chests, but the code is using it to store the number of keys. This will cause the code to produce incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code is not checking if the sum of the key number and the chest number is odd. This means that the code will incorrectly open chests that cannot be opened.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The code is counting the number of chests that can be opened one less than the actual number. This means that the code will produce incorrect results.
5. **Infinite loop**. The code is not checking if there are any keys that can be used to open a chest. This means that the code will enter an infinite loop.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1173_E2. Nauuo and Pictures (hard version)

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect modular arithmetic**

When doing modular arithmetic, it is important to be aware of the fact that **multiplication** is not commutative. This means that ```a * b % m``` is not necessarily equal to ```b * a % m```. For example, ```12 * 13 % 100``` is equal to ```156```, but ```13 * 12 % 100``` is equal to ```114```.

This can be a source of errors when solving problems involving modular arithmetic, as it is easy to accidentally make a mistake when multiplying two numbers together. To avoid this, it is important to be careful and to always keep track of the order in which you are multiplying the numbers.

**2. Using the wrong modulus**

Another common mistake that developers make when solving problems involving modular arithmetic is using the wrong modulus. This can happen when the problem statement does not specify the modulus, or when the developer mistakenly assumes that the modulus is the same as the number of elements in the set.

For example, suppose you are given a set of integers ```S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}``` and you are asked to find the sum of all the elements in the set modulo 10. If you mistakenly use the modulus ```11``` instead of ```10```, you will get the wrong answer.

To avoid this error, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and to make sure that you are using the correct modulus.

**3. Using incorrect algorithms**

There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to solve problems involving modular arithmetic. The correct algorithm to use will depend on the specific problem that you are trying to solve.

For example, if you are trying to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers, you can use the Euclidean algorithm. If you are trying to find the remainder of a division operation, you can use the modulo operator.

It is important to choose the correct algorithm for the problem that you are trying to solve. Using the wrong algorithm can lead to incorrect results.

**4. Not testing your code**

One of the most important steps in any programming project is to test your code. This is especially important when you are solving a problem involving modular arithmetic, as there are a number of potential pitfalls that you can fall into.

To test your code, you should create a set of test cases that cover all of the different possible scenarios. You should then run your code on these test cases and make sure that it produces the correct results.

By testing your code, you can help to catch any errors that you may have made and to ensure that your code is correct.

**5. Using a calculator**

While it is tempting to use a calculator to help you solve problems involving modular arithmetic, this is not always a good idea. Calculators can sometimes make mistakes, and they can also be difficult to use when the numbers are large.

It is generally better to do the calculations by hand, or to use a computer program. This will help to ensure that the calculations are correct and that you understand the process.

CODEFORCES 1191_C. Tokitsukaze and Discard Items

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correctly parsed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is `10 4 5`, the program may incorrectly parse it as `10 4 5 a` and throw an error.
* **Incorrect data type:** The data type of the input may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is `10 4 5`, the program may incorrectly parse it as `10 4 5.0` and throw an error.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic of the program may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may incorrectly assume that the special items are always in the first page, which would lead to incorrect results.
* **Off-by-one errors:** The program may make off-by-one errors, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may incorrectly calculate the number of operations, which would lead to incorrect results.
* **Memory leaks:** The program may leak memory, which may lead to the program crashing or running out of memory. For example, the program may not free the memory allocated for the input data, which would lead to a memory leak.
* **Race conditions:** The program may have race conditions, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may access the same data from multiple threads without synchronization, which could lead to data corruption.
* **Deadlocks:** The program may deadlock, which means that it will stop responding and the user will have to force-quit the program. For example, the program may have two threads that are waiting for each other to finish, which would lead to a deadlock.
* **Security vulnerabilities:** The program may have security vulnerabilities, which could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or system. For example, the program may not properly validate user input, which could allow attackers to inject malicious code into the program.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1230_A. Dawid and Bags of Candies

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a list of four integers, each separated by a space. If the input is not in the correct format, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will likely produce an incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the total number of candies.** The total number of candies is equal to the sum of the candies in each bag. If the program does not correctly calculate this value, it will not be able to determine whether it is possible to distribute the bags in such a way that each friend receives the same amount of candies.
3. **Incorrect logic for determining whether it is possible to distribute the bags.** The program must first calculate the total number of candies and then compare it to the number of friends. If the total number of candies is divisible by the number of friends, then it is possible to distribute the bags in such a way that each friend receives the same amount of candies. Otherwise, it is not possible.
4. **Incorrect output.** The output should be either "YES" or "NO". If the program outputs anything else, it is incorrect.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Make sure that the input is in the correct format.
* Use a function to calculate the total number of candies. This will help to prevent errors in calculation.
* Use a conditional statement to determine whether it is possible to distribute the bags.
* Use the `print()` function to output the correct answer.

CODEFORCES 1251_E1. Voting (Easy Version)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always followed correctly. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect variable type**. The variables used in the program must be of the correct type. For example, if a variable is declared as an integer, but it is assigned a string value, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be correct. For example, if the program is supposed to find the minimum value of a set of numbers, but it instead finds the maximum value, the program will produce incorrect output.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the program misses or adds one element when iterating over a list or array. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output.
5. **Indexing errors**. Indexing errors occur when the program accesses an element of a list or array that is out of bounds. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
6. **Null pointer exceptions**. Null pointer exceptions occur when the program tries to access a variable that has not been initialized. This can cause the program to crash.
7. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when the program allocates memory that is never freed. This can eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
8. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output or crash.
9. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely.
10. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can occur when the program is not properly protected from malicious attacks. This can allow attackers to gain access to the program's data or even take control of the program.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1294_D. MEX maximizing

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrectly calculating the MEX of the array.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. To correctly calculate the MEX of the array, you need to consider all of the possible values that the array could have after performing all of the operations. For example, in the example above, the array could have the values [0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 10], [0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 7], or [0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 4]. The MEX of each of these arrays is different, so you need to make sure to consider all of the possibilities.
2. **Incorrectly applying the operations to the array.** When you are applying the operations to the array, you need to make sure that you are not changing the MEX of the array. For example, in the example above, you cannot apply the operation `a[4] := a[4] + 3` to the array after the fifth query because it would change the MEX of the array from 4 to 5.
3. **Not using the most efficient algorithm.** There are a number of different algorithms that you can use to solve this problem. The most efficient algorithm is the binary search algorithm. This algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the range of possible values for the MEX in half until it finds the correct value.
4. **Not handling edge cases correctly.** There are a number of edge cases that you need to be aware of when solving this problem. For example, what happens if the array is empty? What happens if the array contains only one element? What happens if the array contains all of the same value?
5. **Not testing your code thoroughly.** It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it to the contest. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that developers have encountered when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly calculating the MEX of the array.** One common mistake that developers make is to incorrectly calculate the MEX of the array. For example, a developer might think that the MEX of the array [0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 10] is 7. However, this is incorrect because the array could also have the value [0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 4]. The MEX of this array is 4, which is less than 7.
* **Incorrectly applying the operations to the array.** Another common mistake that developers make is to incorrectly apply the operations to the array. For example, a developer might think that they can apply the operation `a[4] := a[4] + 3` to the array after the fifth query in the example above. However, this is incorrect because it would change the MEX of the array from 4 to 5.
* **Not using the most efficient algorithm.** Many developers use inefficient algorithms to solve this problem. For example, a developer might use a linear search algorithm to find the MEX of the array. This algorithm is very inefficient because it has to search through the entire array to find the MEX.
* **Not handling edge cases correctly.** There are a number of edge cases that developers need to be aware of when solving this problem. For example, what happens if the array is empty? What happens if the array contains only one element? What happens if the array contains all of the same value?
* **Not testing your code thoroughly.** Many developers do not test their code thoroughly before submitting it to the contest. This can lead to bugs that are not caught until it is too late.

By avoiding these common problems and bugs, you can increase your chances of solving this problem correctly.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always strictly followed, and it is easy to make a mistake when parsing the input. For example, if the input contains a space between two integers, it will be interpreted as two separate integers instead of one.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating over an array or list, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one element or count one element twice. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Indexing errors**. When accessing elements of an array or list, it is important to make sure that the index is within the bounds of the array. Otherwise, you will get an error.
4. **Arithmetic errors**. When performing arithmetic operations, it is important to make sure that the operands are of the same type and that the results are within the expected range. Otherwise, you will get an error.
5. **Logic errors**. When writing code, it is important to make sure that the logic is correct. This means that the code should do what it is supposed to do, and it should not produce any unexpected results.
6. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating over an array or list, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one element or count one element twice. This can lead to incorrect results.

CODEFORCES 1336_F. Journey

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the tree data structure.** The tree data structure is a fundamental part of this problem, and any mistakes in its implementation could lead to incorrect results. For example, if the tree is not correctly connected, then it will be impossible to find all of the pairs of travelers that will become friends.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the shortest path algorithm.** The shortest path algorithm is used to find the paths that the travelers will take. If the algorithm is not implemented correctly, then it will be impossible to determine which pairs of travelers will become friends.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm for counting the number of pairs of friends.** The algorithm for counting the number of pairs of friends is a complex one, and any mistakes in its implementation could lead to incorrect results. For example, if the algorithm does not take into account the fact that the travelers may take the same path, then it will overestimate the number of pairs of friends.
4. **Incorrect input validation.** The input to this problem is not always correct, and it is important to validate the input before processing it. For example, if the input contains an edge that does not exist in the tree, then the algorithm will crash.
5. **Incorrect output formatting.** The output to this problem must be formatted correctly. For example, the output must not contain any extra spaces or newlines.

By avoiding these common problems and bugs, you can increase the chances of your code successfully solving this problem.

```

where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of cities, `m` is the number of roads, `k` is the required maximum speed limit, and `x1`, `y1`, `s1`, `x2`, `y2`, `s2`, etc. are the cities and speed limits of the roads.

If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is:

```
ans
```

where `ans` is the minimum number of changes the Ministry has to perform so that the maximum speed limit among the remaining (n - 1) roads is exactly k.

If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly output the answer and will receive a negative score.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

CODEFORCES 1493_C. K-beautiful Strings

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct.**

The input format of the problem is:

```
The first line contains a single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 10 000) — the number of test cases.

The next 2 ⋅ T lines contain the description of test cases. The description of each test case consists of two lines.

The first line of the description contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the length of string s and number k respectively.

The second line contains string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
```

However, the input format in the example is:

```
4
4 2
abcd
3 1
abc
4 3
aaaa
9 3
abaabaaaa
```

The input format is not correct because it does not have the first line that contains the number of test cases.

**2. The output format is not correct.**

The output format of the problem is:

```
For each test case output in a separate line lexicographically smallest beautiful string of length n, which is greater or equal to string s, or -1 if such a string does not exist.
```

However, the output format in the example is:

```

acac
abc
-1
abaabaaab
```

The output format is not correct because it does not have the number of test cases.

**3. The problem is not well-defined.**

The problem is not well-defined because it does not specify what to do if there is no beautiful string that is greater than or equal to s.

**4. The problem is too difficult.**

The problem is too difficult because it requires the developer to have a good understanding of the concept of beautiful strings.

**5. The problem is not interesting.**

The problem is not interesting because it does not have any real-world applications.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1515_I. Phoenix and Diamonds

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

When reading input, make sure to read the data in the correct format. For example, if the input is an integer, make sure to read it as an integer and not as a string.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

When iterating over an array or a list, make sure to check the bounds of the iteration. For example, if you are iterating over an array of size n, make sure that you do not iterate past the index n - 1.

**3. Logic errors**

When writing your code, make sure to carefully check your logic. For example, make sure that you are not making any assumptions about the input data.

**4. Undefined behavior**

When writing your code, make sure to avoid undefined behavior. For example, do not use uninitialized variables or divide by zero.

**5. Memory leaks**

When writing your code, make sure to free any memory that you allocate. This can be done using the `delete` keyword in C++ or the `free` function in C.

**6. Race conditions**

When writing multi-threaded code, make sure to avoid race conditions. A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same shared resource at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even crashes.

**7. Deadlocks**

When writing multi-threaded code, make sure to avoid deadlocks. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, but neither thread can do so. This can lead to the threads being stuck in an infinite loop.

**8. Buffer overflows**

When writing code, make sure to check the size of the buffer before writing to it. A buffer overflow occurs when you write more data to a buffer than it can hold. This can lead to security vulnerabilities.

CODEFORCES 239_A. Two Bags of Potatoes

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is a list of integers, but the developer may accidentally use a different data type, such as a string. This can lead to errors in the calculation of the output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the output**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the possible values of x. For example, they may forget to take into account the fact that x must be a positive integer. This can lead to the output of incorrect values, or even to a runtime error.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The developer may incorrectly format the output. For example, they may not use the correct whitespace characters, or they may not print the output in the correct order. This can make the output difficult to read and understand.
4. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, they may accidentally use a variable that has not been initialized, or they may make a logical error in their code. These bugs can lead to incorrect results, or even to a runtime error.

CODEFORCES 263_D. Cycle in Graph

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are following the format exactly, or your code will not work correctly. For example, if you forget to put a space between two numbers, or if you put the numbers in the wrong order, your code will not be able to parse the input correctly.

**2. Incorrect graph representation**

The graph is represented as a list of edges. Each edge is represented by a pair of integers, where the first integer is the starting node of the edge and the second integer is the ending node of the edge. It is important to make sure that you are correctly representing the graph, or your code will not be able to find a cycle. For example, if you accidentally reverse the order of the two integers in an edge, your code will not be able to find a cycle.

**3. Incorrect cycle detection algorithm**

The cycle detection algorithm is the most important part of this problem. There are many different ways to find a cycle in a graph, but not all of them are correct. For example, a naive algorithm that simply checks every possible combination of edges will not work correctly, because it is possible for a graph to have multiple cycles. A more efficient algorithm would be to use a depth-first search or a breadth-first search.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also very specific. It is important to make sure that you are following the format exactly, or your code will not be accepted. For example, if you forget to put a space between two numbers, or if you put the numbers in the wrong order, your code will not be accepted.

**5. Other bugs**

There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the developer may accidentally use the wrong variable, or they may forget to initialize a variable. It is important to be careful and to check your code thoroughly before submitting it.

CODEFORCES 451_D. Count Good Substrings

Pain points:
**1. The input string may contain characters other than 'a' and 'b'.**

To solve this problem, we need to first check if the input string contains any characters other than 'a' and 'b'. If it does, we can raise an error.

**2. The input string may be empty.**

If the input string is empty, then there are no good substrings of any length. We can simply print `0 0` in this case.

**3. The input string may contain only one character.**

If the input string contains only one character, then there is only one good substring of that length. We can simply print `1 0` or `0 1` depending on the character.

**4. The input string may contain only characters of the same type.**

If the input string contains only characters of the same type, then all substrings are good. We can simply print `n n` in this case.

**5. The input string may contain both characters of type 'a' and characters of type 'b'.**

This is the most common case. In this case, we need to consider each substring of the input string and determine if it is good. A substring is good if it is a palindrome after merging all the consecutive equal characters. We can use a simple algorithm to check if a substring is a palindrome.

**6. The output format is incorrect.**

The output should be two space-separated integers: the number of good substrings of even length and the number of good substrings of odd length. We can check if the output format is correct by using a simple regular expression.

**7. The code is not efficient.**

The code can be made more efficient by using some data structures and algorithms. For example, we can use a hash table to store the number of occurrences of each character in the input string. This will allow us to quickly check if a substring is a palindrome.
Test inputs:
**Incorrect input:**
```
a
```

**Incorrect output:**
```
0 0
```

**Incorrect code:**
```
s = input()
count_even = 0
count_odd = 0
for i in range(len(s)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
        if s[i:j] == s[j - 1:i - 1:-1]:
            if j % 2 == 0:
                count_even += 1
            else:
                count_odd += 1
print(count_even, count_odd)
```

**Correct input:**
```
bb
```

**Correct output:**
```
1 2
```

**Correct code:**
```
s = input()
count_even = 0

    if s[i] == s[i - 1]:
        count_even += 1

CODEFORCES 474_C. Captain Marmot

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to put a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When computing the area of a square, it's easy to make a mistake and add or subtract one to the answer. This can lead to the program incorrectly identifying a regiment as compact or not.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic for determining whether a regiment is compact or not is relatively complex, and it's easy to make a mistake. For example, you might forget to check that all four moles are in the same quadrant, or you might not account for the fact that the moles can be rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise around their home points.
4. **Memory errors.** If you don't allocate enough memory for the data structures that you need, the program will crash. This is especially important to keep in mind when working with large input sets.
5. **Timeout errors.** If your program takes too long to run, it will be marked as a time limit exceeded. This can happen if your algorithm is inefficient, or if you have too much code that is not relevant to the problem.

CODEFORCES 498_B. Name That Tune

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correctly parsed by the program. This can lead to unexpected results or errors. For example, if the input contains a number with a decimal point, the program may interpret it as two separate numbers.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The program may not correctly handle data of the wrong type. For example, if the input contains a string instead of a number, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to incorrect results or errors.

**4. Array out-of-bounds errors**

Array out-of-bounds errors occur when a programmer tries to access an element of an array that does not exist. This can lead to crashes or incorrect results.

**5. Memory leaks**

Memory leaks occur when a programmer allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

**6. Race conditions**

Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or errors.

**7. Deadlocks**

Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, but neither one will release the resource first. This can lead to the program being stuck in an infinite loop.

**8. Security vulnerabilities**

Security vulnerabilities can occur when a programmer writes code that is not secure. This can allow attackers to gain access to the program or the data it is processing.

**9. Unintended consequences**

Even if a program is written correctly, it may still have unintended consequences. For example, a program that is designed to help users may actually end up causing them harm.

**10. Difficult to debug**

Bugs can be difficult to debug, especially if they are not causing obvious problems. This can lead to the program being released with bugs that are not found until it is too late.

CODEFORCES 548_E. Mike and Foam

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of integers. If the developer does not correctly parse the input data as a list of integers, the program will not work correctly.

**2. Incorrect logic**

The program needs to calculate the score of the shelf after each query. The score of the shelf is the number of pairs (i, j) of glasses in the shelf such that i < j and gcd(a, b) > 1. The developer needs to correctly implement this logic in order for the program to work correctly.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

The developer needs to be careful to avoid off-by-one errors when calculating the score of the shelf. For example, if the developer is calculating the score of the shelf after adding a beer to the shelf, they need to make sure to include the beer in the calculation.

**4. Memory leaks**

The developer needs to be careful to avoid memory leaks in their program. For example, if the developer is using a list to store the beers in the shelf, they need to make sure to delete the list when they are finished with it.

Pain points:
### Possible Problems and Bugs

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, you might accidentally read the number of layers as the number of columns, or you might forget to read the newline character between the layers. This can lead to incorrect results or runtime errors.
2. **Incorrect traversal of the grid.** The problem asks you to find all critical CPUs, which are CPUs that control other CPUs but are not controlled by any other CPUs. To do this, you need to traverse the grid of CPUs and keep track of which CPUs are controlled by which other CPUs. This can be a tricky problem to solve, and it's easy to make mistakes.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the control algorithm.** The control algorithm is the key to solving this problem. It's a recursive algorithm that takes a CPU as input and returns a list of all the CPUs that it controls. This algorithm can be tricky to implement correctly, and it's easy to make mistakes.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement specifies a few edge cases, such as the case where all the CPUs are malfunctioning or the case where there are no CPUs that control other CPUs. You need to make sure that your code handles these edge cases correctly.
5. **Incorrect output format.** The output for this problem is a single integer, which is the number of critical CPUs. You need to make sure that your code prints the output in the correct format.

### How to Avoid These Problems

To avoid these problems, you should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand the input format and the output format. You should also carefully implement the control algorithm and make sure that it handles all of the edge cases correctly. Finally, you should carefully test your code to make sure that it produces the correct output.

Here are some specific tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use a debugger to help you track down errors in your code.
* Test your code with a variety of different inputs.
* Ask a friend or colleague to review your code.
* Use a code review tool to help you find potential problems.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

CODEFORCES 666_B. World Tour

Pain points:
1. **Inefficient data structure.** The input contains a lot of data, so it is important to use a data structure that allows for fast access and updates. A naive approach would be to store the roads in a list, but this would be very inefficient. A better approach would be to use a hash map, where the key is the pair of cities and the value is the length of the road. This would allow for fast access to the roads and updates to the lengths of the roads.
2. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm used to find the optimal tour must be correct. A common mistake is to only consider the shortest path between each pair of cities. However, this is not always the best way to find the optimal tour. A better approach is to consider all possible tours and choose the one with the longest total distance.
3. **Incorrect output.** The output must be in the correct format. A common mistake is to print the cities in the wrong order or to print the wrong number of cities.
4. **Incorrect runtime.** The algorithm must run in a reasonable amount of time. A common mistake is to use an algorithm that is too slow. A better approach would be to use a more efficient algorithm or to parallelize the computation.
5. **Incorrect memory usage.** The algorithm must not use too much memory. A common mistake is to use a data structure that is too large. A better approach would be to use a more compact data structure or to use a memory-efficient algorithm.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design and implement the algorithm. It is also important to test the algorithm thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and efficient.

CODEFORCES 690_A1. Collective Mindsets (easy)

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct.**

The input format is `N`, where `N` is the number of attendees. However, the input format in the problem statement is `1 ≤ N ≤ 109`. This means that the input can be any integer between 1 and 109, inclusive. However, the input format in the code is `int(input())`, which only accepts integers that can be represented by a 32-bit signed integer. This means that the input can only be between -2147483648 and 2147483647, inclusive. This is a problem because if the input is larger than 2147483647, the code will not be able to handle it correctly.

**2. The output format is not correct.**

The output format is `B`, where `B` is the smallest number of brains that have to be in the chest for Heidi to take one brain home. However, the output format in the code is `print(B)`, which only prints the value of `B` to the console. This is a problem because the problem statement requires the output to be a single integer.

**3. The code does not handle the case where there are no brains in the chest.**

The problem statement states that there must be at least one brain in the chest for Heidi to take one brain home. However, the code does not check for this condition. This is a problem because if there are no brains in the chest, the code will not output anything.

**4. The code does not handle the case where there are more than one brain in the chest.**

The problem statement states that there must be at least one brain in the chest for Heidi to take one brain home. However, the code does not check for this condition. This is a problem because if there are more than one brain in the chest, the code will only output the number of brains that are needed to give Heidi one brain. This is not what the problem statement asks for.

**5. The code does not handle the case where there are exactly N brains in the chest.**

The problem statement states that there must be at least one brain in the chest for Heidi to take one brain home. However, the code does not check for this condition. This is a problem because if there are exactly N brains in the chest, the code will not output anything.

**6. The code does not handle the case where there are more than N brains in the chest.**

The problem statement states that there must be at least one brain in the chest for Heidi to take one brain home. However, the code does not check for this condition. This is a problem because if there are more than N brains in the chest, the code will only output the number of brains that are needed to give Heidi one brain.

2. **Off-by-one errors.** The developer may forget to add or subtract 1 when computing the number of possible games. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect modulo operation.** The developer may forget to perform the modulo operation when computing the number of possible games. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect use of the mod operator.** The developer may use the mod operator incorrectly. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
x = x % m
```

This code will only work if `x` is less than `m`. If `x` is greater than `m`, the remainder will be negative, and the code will not work correctly.
5. **Incorrect use of the pow function.** The developer may use the pow function incorrectly. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
x = pow(2, 3)
```

This code will return the value `8`, which is not the correct value of 2 raised to the power of 3. The correct code is:

```
x = 2 ** 3

4. **Memory errors:** The program may run out of memory while it is running. This can happen if the program uses too much memory, or if the program does not free up memory that it is no longer using.
5. **Time errors:** The program may take too long to run. This can happen if the program is inefficient, or if the program does not terminate correctly.
6. **Other bugs:** There are a number of other possible bugs that could occur in a program. These include bugs in the user interface, bugs in the error handling, and bugs in the testing.

**How to Avoid These Problems:**

1. **Test your code thoroughly:** The best way to avoid problems is to test your code thoroughly. This means testing your code with a variety of input values, and checking for both correct and incorrect output.
2. **Use the right data types:** Make sure that you are using the right data types for your variables. For example, if you are storing a number, you should use a `int` or `float` data type, rather than a `string` data type.
3. **Use efficient algorithms:** When you are writing your code, make sure that you are using efficient algorithms. This means using algorithms that are designed to run quickly and use as little memory as possible.
4. **Document your code:** When you are writing your code, make sure that you document it clearly. This will help other people to understand how your code works, and it will help you to debug your code if it does not work correctly.
5. **Use a debugger:** If you are having trouble debugging your code, you can use a debugger to help you. A debugger allows you to step through your code line by line, and it can help you to identify errors in your code.

It is important to read the problem statement carefully and make sure that you understand all of the requirements. In this problem, for example, it is important to understand that the cuts must be made between consecutive ingredients and that the ingredients before the first cut and after the last cut are not considered.
* **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** Once you have a good understanding of the problem statement, you need to implement a solution. It is important to carefully read the problem statement and make sure that your implementation matches the requirements. In this problem, for example, it is important to correctly calculate the maximum number of cuts that can be made and to correctly count the number of valid sets of cuts for each possible size.
* **Incorrect test cases.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. This includes providing a variety of test cases that cover all of the different possible scenarios. In this problem, for example, it is important to test your solution with both small and large inputs and with both valid and invalid inputs.
* **Incorrect submission.** Once you are confident that your solution is correct, you need to submit it to the competition. It is important to carefully follow the submission instructions and to make sure that your solution is formatted correctly. In this problem, for example, it is important to make sure that your solution is in the correct format and that it does not exceed the maximum allowed size.

Title:
CODEFORCES 802_I. Fake News (hard)

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of data types**

When dealing with large strings, it is important to use the correct data type to store them. For example, a string with a length of 100,000 characters would be too large to store in a variable of type `char`. Instead, you should use a data type such as `string` or `std::string`.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

When dealing with substrings, it is important to be careful about off-by-one errors. For example, if you are trying to find the substring `"abc"` in the string `"abcd"`, you need to make sure that you start the search at index 0 and end the search at index 2. If you start the search at index 1 or end the search at index 3, you will not find the substring.

**3. Incorrect use of loops**

When using loops to iterate over a string, it is important to make sure that you do not go out of bounds. For example, if you are trying to iterate over the characters in a string with a length of 100,000 characters, you should use a `for` loop with an upper bound of 100,000. If you use a `for` loop with an upper bound of 101,000, you will iterate over the characters in the string twice, which will result in an incorrect answer.

**4. Incorrect use of functions**

When using functions to calculate the self-similarity of a string, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct functions. For example, the `std::count()` function can be used to count the number of occurrences of a substring in a string. However, the `std::count()` function does not take into account the overlapping occurrences of a substring. To calculate the self-similarity of a string, you need to use a function that does take into account the overlapping occurrences of a substring.

**5. Incorrect use of memory**

When dealing with large strings, it is important to be careful about memory usage. For example, if you are creating a new string every time you need to find a substring, you will quickly run out of memory. Instead, you should reuse the same string whenever possible.

Title:
CODEFORCES 825_E. Minimal Labels

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly assigning labels to vertices.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. They may accidentally assign the same label to two different vertices, or they may assign a label that is not in the range 1 to n.
2. **Not considering the direction of edges.** When assigning labels to vertices, it is important to consider the direction of edges. An edge from vertex v to vertex u means that vertex v must have a smaller label than vertex u.
3. **Not finding the lexicographically smallest permutation.** The output of your program should be the lexicographically smallest permutation of labels that satisfies all the conditions. This means that the first label should be the smallest possible, the second label should be the second smallest possible, and so on.
4. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others, and some algorithms are more likely to find the correct solution. It is important to choose an algorithm that is appropriate for the problem you are trying to solve.
5. **Not testing your code.** It is always important to test your code before submitting it to a competition. This will help you to catch any errors in your code and make sure that it is correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 848_C. Goodbye Souvenir

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving problems. It is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. The algorithm should be implemented correctly, and all edge cases should be handled.
2. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The choice of data structure is important for solving some problems efficiently. For example, a hash table can be used to quickly find the location of a particular element in a list. It is important to choose the right data structure for the problem at hand.
3. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve different problems. It is important to choose the right algorithm for the problem at hand. For example, a brute-force algorithm will not be efficient for solving a problem that can be solved using a more efficient algorithm.
4. **Incorrect error handling.** It is important to handle errors gracefully. For example, if a file cannot be opened, the program should print an error message and exit.
5. **Incorrect testing.** It is important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it is working correctly. This can be done by writing unit tests, integration tests, and system tests.
6. **Incorrect documentation.** It is important to document the program so that other developers can understand how it works. This can be done by writing comments in the code, and by creating a user manual.

Title:
CODEFORCES 870_A. Search for Pretty Integers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always as expected. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may be separated by commas instead of spaces. The developer must be careful to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format must be exactly as specified in the problem statement. For example, the output must be a single integer, and it must be written in the correct format (e.g., with no leading zeros). The developer must be careful to format the output correctly.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer must use an algorithm that is correct and efficient. For example, the developer must not use a brute-force algorithm that simply checks every possible integer. The developer must use a more efficient algorithm, such as a greedy algorithm or a dynamic programming algorithm.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer must be careful to avoid off-by-one errors, which can occur when the developer is counting or indexing elements. For example, the developer might accidentally count the first element of an array twice, or the developer might index an array one element beyond the end of the array.
5. **Memory errors**. The developer must be careful not to allocate too much memory, or the program may crash. The developer must also be careful to free memory that is no longer needed, to avoid memory leaks.
6. **Synchronization errors**. The developer must be careful to synchronize access to shared data, to avoid race conditions. For example, the developer might need to use a mutex to protect access to a shared variable.
7. **Exception handling errors**. The developer must be careful to handle exceptions correctly. For example, the developer might need to catch an exception if the input file cannot be opened.
8. **Security errors**. The developer must be careful to avoid security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows and SQL injection attacks. For example, the developer must not use untrusted input in a vulnerable function, such as strcpy().
9. **Documentation errors**. The developer must provide clear and concise documentation for the code. The documentation should include a description of the code, the purpose of the code, and the assumptions and limitations of the code.

CODEFORCES 896_E. Welcome home, Chtholly

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be strictly followed. If the input format is not correct, the program may crash or give incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of each input should be correct. For example, if the input is an integer, but the program treats it as a string, the program may crash or give incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program should be correct. For example, if the program does not consider all possible cases, the program may crash or give incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. The program should be implemented correctly. For example, if the program uses the wrong data structure or algorithm, the program may crash or give incorrect output.
5. **Incorrect debugging**. If the program does not work correctly, the developer should debug the program to find the errors. The debugging process can be very time-consuming and difficult.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input format, data type, logic, implementation, and debugging.

Title:
CODEFORCES 918_A. Eleven

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Fibonacci sequence.** The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. For example, the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34. A common mistake is to start the sequence with 0, 1, 2, instead of 0, 1, 1. This will result in an incorrect sequence of numbers.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** Another common mistake is to forget to add 1 to the index when computing the next Fibonacci number. For example, if the current number in the sequence is 5, the next number should be 5 + 3 = 8. However, if you forget to add 1 to the index, you will compute the next number as 5 + 2 = 7, which is incorrect.
3. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 is 1, because 10 divided by 3 has a remainder of 1. A common mistake is to use the modulo operator incorrectly. For example, if you want to check if a number is a Fibonacci number, you cannot simply check if the number is divisible by 3. This is because some Fibonacci numbers, such as 5 and 8, are not divisible by 3. Instead, you need to check if the number is equal to the sum of the two previous Fibonacci numbers.
4. **Incorrect use of the conditional operator.** The conditional operator (? :) is used to evaluate a condition and return one of two values depending on the result of the condition. For example, the following code will print "true" if the variable `n` is equal to 5, and "false" otherwise:

```
if (n == 5) {
  print("true");
} else {
  print("false");
}
```

A common mistake is to forget to add parentheses around the condition. For example, the following code will always print "true", even if the variable `n` is not equal to 5:

```
if n == 5 {
  print("true");
} else {
  print("false");
}
```

5. **Incorrect use of the for loop.** The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence of values. For example, the following code will print the numbers from 1 to 10:

```
for (var i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  print(i);
}
```

A common mistake is to forget to initialize the loop variable. For example, the following code will not compile:

```
for (var i; i <= 10; i++) {
  print(i);
}
```

6. **Incorrect use of the break statement.** The break statement is used to terminate a loop early. For example, the following code will print the numbers from 1 to 10, but it will stop printing after the number 5:

```
for (var i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  if (i == 5) {
    break;
  }
  print(i);
}
```

A common mistake is to use the break statement incorrectly. For example, the following code will not print any numbers:

```
for (var i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  if (i == 5) {
    break;
  }
}
```

CODEFORCES 967_D. Resource Distribution

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type:** The input data is given as integers, but some developers may mistakenly use floating-point numbers to store the data. This can lead to incorrect results, as floating-point numbers are not always precise.
2. **Not handling overflow:** The input data may contain very large integers, which can cause overflow if the developer is not careful. This can lead to incorrect results or even a segmentation fault.
3. **Not using the right algorithm:** The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm, but some developers may try to use a more complex algorithm that is not necessary. This can lead to slower execution time and unnecessary complexity.
4. **Not handling special cases:** The problem statement specifies some special cases, such as when the number of servers is less than the number of services or when the resource requirements of the services are greater than the total number of resource units available. Developers should make sure to handle these special cases correctly.
5. **Not testing the code:** It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. This can be done by creating a variety of test cases, including both positive and negative cases.

Title:
HACKEREARTH dummy-3-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly using the `range()` function.** The `range()` function in Python returns a sequence of numbers from start to stop, excluding stop. This means that if you want to iterate over the numbers from 1 to 10, you would need to use `range(1, 11)`. If you accidentally use `range(1, 10)`, you will miss the number 10.
2. **Using the wrong comparison operator.** The comparison operators `<` and `>` compare two values and return a Boolean value of True or False. For example, `1 < 2` returns True and `2 > 1` returns False. However, the comparison operators `!=` and `==` compare two values and return a Boolean value of True or False. For example, `1 != 2` returns True and `1 == 2` returns False.
3. **Misunderstanding the problem statement.** The problem statement asks you to create a special list out of the given list. It should be such that the position of integer i is the i-th number in the given list. This means that if the given list is `[1, 2, 3]`, the special list should be `[3, 2, 1]`.
4. **Incorrectly using the `list()` function.** The `list()` function in Python creates a new list from the given iterable. For example, `list("abc")` creates a new list with the elements `"a"`, `"b"`, and `"c"`. However, if you accidentally use the `list()` function on a non-iterable object, you will get an error.
5. **Using the wrong data type.** The problem statement asks you to create a list of integers. However, if you accidentally create a list of strings, you will get an error.
6. **Not handling the edge cases.** The problem statement does not specify what to do if the given list is empty. You should handle this case by returning `"not inverse"`.

Title:
HACKEREARTH little-stuart-and-evil-hackers-2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 is 1, because 10 divided by 3 has a remainder of 1. However, if you try to use the modulo operator on a number that is larger than the modulus, the result will be incorrect. For example, 10000 % 3 is 2, because 10000 divided by 3 has a remainder of 2. This is because the modulo operator only returns the remainder of the division operation, and it does not take into account the sign of the numbers.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a developer forgets to add or subtract one from a calculation. For example, if you are trying to calculate the sum of the first 100 numbers, you might accidentally start with the number 0 instead of 1. This would result in an incorrect answer of 4950 instead of 5050.
3. **Incorrect use of factorials.** Factorials are a mathematical operation that is used to calculate the product of all the numbers from 1 to a given number. For example, 5! is equal to 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5, which is equal to 120. However, if you try to calculate a factorial of a number that is larger than the maximum value of an integer, the result will be incorrect. For example, 100! is equal to 9.333e+157, which is larger than the maximum value of an integer (2^31 - 1). This is because the factorial function uses recursion, which means that it calls itself over and over again. If the number is too large, the function will eventually call itself with a negative number, which will cause an error.
4. **Incorrect use of exponentiation.** Exponentiation is a mathematical operation that is used to raise a number to a power. For example, 2^3 is equal to 8, because 2 multiplied by itself three times is equal to 8. However, if you try to exponentiate a number by a negative number, the result will be incorrect. For example, 2^(-3) is equal to 0.125, because 1 / 2 multiplied by itself three times is equal to 0.125. This is because exponentiation is not commutative, which means that a^b is not equal to b^a.
5. **Incorrect use of the binomial theorem.** The binomial theorem is a mathematical formula that is used to expand a binomial expression. For example, (x + y)^2 is equal to x^2 + 2xy + y^2. However, if you try to use the binomial theorem on an expression that has negative terms, the result will be incorrect. For example, (x - y)^2 is not equal to x^2 - 2xy + y^2. This is because the binomial theorem only works for expressions that have non-negative terms.

HACKEREARTH primestring

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of distinct alphabets in the string.** This is a common mistake, as it can be difficult to keep track of all the different letters in a long string. One way to avoid this mistake is to use a set to store the unique letters in the string. This will ensure that each letter is only counted once.
2. **Incorrectly counting the number of occurrences of each alphabet in the string.** This is another common mistake, as it can be difficult to keep track of all the different occurrences of each letter. One way to avoid this mistake is to use a dictionary to store the number of occurrences of each letter. This will ensure that each letter is only counted once.
3. **Using the wrong definition of a prime number.** A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. This means that a prime number cannot be written as a product of two other natural numbers. For example, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are all prime numbers, but 4, 6, and 8 are not prime numbers because they can be written as products of two smaller natural numbers (4 = 2 * 2, 6 = 2 * 3, and 8 = 2 * 2 * 2).
4. **Not handling the special case of a string with only one letter.** A string with only one letter is always a prime string, regardless of the number of occurrences of that letter. This is because the number of distinct alphabets in the string is 1, which is a prime number, and the number of occurrences of each alphabet in the string is also 1, which is a prime number.
5. **Not handling the special case of a string with no letters.** A string with no letters is not a prime string, because the number of distinct alphabets in the string is 0, which is not a prime number.

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one errors**. The most common bug is to forget to add 1 to the final answer. This can happen when you are iterating over a list of numbers and adding them up, or when you are computing the length of a string.
2. **Incorrect boundary conditions**. Another common bug is to forget to check for boundary conditions. For example, if you are asked to find the minimum value in a list, you need to make sure that the list is not empty.
3. **Incorrect data types**. Be careful about the data types that you are using. For example, if you are asked to compute the sum of a list of numbers, you need to make sure that all of the numbers are of the same type.
4. **Logic errors**. This is a catch-all category for any errors that are not caused by the previous three problems. For example, you might make a mistake in your algorithm, or you might not understand the problem correctly.
5. **Runtime errors**. These are errors that occur when your program is running. For example, you might run out of memory, or you might divide by zero.

Title:
ATCODER p02761 AtCoder Beginner Contest 157 - Guess The Number

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of integers. If we use the wrong data type to store the input data, it may cause problems when we try to access the elements of the list. For example, if we use a string to store the input data, we will not be able to access the elements of the list using the index operator.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The problem is asking us to find the smallest integer that satisfies the given conditions. A naive solution would be to try all possible integers and check if they satisfy the conditions. However, this solution is not efficient because it will take a long time to find the answer. A more efficient solution would be to use a greedy algorithm.

**3. Not handling corner cases**

The problem statement mentions some corner cases, such as the case where the input data is invalid. We need to make sure that our solution handles these corner cases correctly.

**4. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code before submitting it to the judge. This will help us to catch any bugs that we may have missed.

Title:
ATCODER p02896 AtCoder Grand Contest 039 - Min Product Sum

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect calculation of the minimum value**

The minimum value of a set of numbers can be calculated using the following formula:

```
min(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) = \min(x_1, \min(x_2, ..., x_n))
```

For example, the minimum value of the set {1, 2, 3} is 1.

However, some developers may mistakenly calculate the minimum value using the following formula:

```
min(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) = x_1 \min(x_2, ..., x_n)
```

This will result in an incorrect answer, as the minimum value of the set {1, 2, 3} would be 2, instead of 1.

**2. Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic**

Modulo arithmetic is a mathematical operation that returns the remainder of a division. For example, 10 mod 3 is 1, because 10 divided by 3 has a remainder of 1.

When working with modulo arithmetic, it is important to remember that the result of a modulo operation will always be less than the modulus. For example, 10 mod 3 will always be less than 3.

Some developers may mistakenly use modulo arithmetic incorrectly, by performing operations that result in a value that is greater than the modulus. This will cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of programming error that occurs when a developer forgets to add or subtract one from a calculation. For example, a developer might accidentally write the following code:

```
sum = sum + i
```

instead of the correct code:

```
sum = sum + i + 1
```

This would cause the program to produce an incorrect result.

**4. Incorrect use of pointers**

Pointers are a powerful tool that can be used to access memory directly. However, they can also be a source of errors if they are not used correctly.

One common error that developers make is to dereference a null pointer. A null pointer is a pointer that points to nothing, and dereferencing a null pointer will cause the program to crash.

Another common error is to pass a pointer to a function that does not expect a pointer. This will cause the function to crash or produce incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect use of arrays**

Arrays are a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same type. When working with arrays, it is important to remember that the index of the first element is 0.

Some developers may mistakenly assume that the index of the first element is 1. This will cause the program to access invalid memory and crash.

**6. Incorrect use of functions**

Functions are a way of grouping together related code. When writing a function, it is important to make sure that the function does what it is supposed to do.

Some developers may mistakenly write functions that do not perform the desired operation. This will cause the program to produce incorrect results.

**7. Incorrect use of variables**

Variables are used to store data in a program. When declaring a variable, it is important to make sure that the variable is of the correct type.

Some developers may mistakenly declare a variable of the wrong type. This will cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**8. Incorrect use of control flow statements**

Control flow statements are used to control the flow of execution of a program. When writing control flow statements, it is important to make sure that the statements are used correctly.

Some developers may mistakenly use control flow statements incorrectly. This will cause the program to behave in an unexpected way.

**9. Incorrect use of exceptions**

Exceptions are used to handle errors that occur during the execution of a program. When writing code that can throw exceptions, it is important to make sure that the exceptions are handled correctly.

Some developers may mistakenly ignore exceptions or handle them incorrectly. This will cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**10. Incorrect use of comments**

Comments are used to document code. When writing comments, it is important to make sure that the comments are clear and concise.

Some developers may mistakenly write comments that are not helpful or that are misleading. This will make it difficult for other developers to understand the code.

Title:
ATCODER p03794 Mujin Programming Challenge 2017 - Oriented Tree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm**

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm for finding the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. It is a recursive algorithm that works by repeatedly applying the following formula:

```
D(u, v) = min(D(u, v), D(u, w) + D(w, v))
```

where `D(u, v)` is the shortest distance from vertex `u` to vertex `v`, and `w` is any vertex that lies on the shortest path from `u` to `v`.

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is often implemented incorrectly, resulting in incorrect results. One common mistake is to forget to initialize the distance matrix `D` to infinity. This can lead to incorrect results, as the algorithm will then incorrectly compute the shortest distance between two vertices that are not connected by an edge.

Another common mistake is to use the wrong order of iteration when applying the Floyd-Warshall formula. The algorithm should iterate over the vertices in a topological order, such that each vertex is visited before any of its adjacent vertices. This ensures that the algorithm will correctly compute the shortest distances between all pairs of vertices.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the Euler tour**

An Euler tour is a path that visits every edge of a directed graph exactly once. The Euler tour can be used to find the number of spanning trees in a graph.

The Euler tour can be implemented incorrectly in a number of ways. One common mistake is to forget to check if the graph is connected. If the graph is not connected, then there will be no Euler tour.

Another common mistake is to forget to handle the case where the graph has multiple edges between two vertices. In this case, the Euler tour will need to visit each edge multiple times.

**3. Incorrect implementation of the Euler path**

An Euler path is a path that visits every edge of a directed graph exactly once, except for one edge that is visited twice. The Euler path can be used to find the number of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in a graph.

The Euler path can be implemented incorrectly in a number of ways. One common mistake is to forget to check if the graph is acyclic. If the graph is not acyclic, then there will be no Euler path.

Another common mistake is to forget to handle the case where the graph has multiple edges between two vertices. In this case, the Euler path will need to visit each edge multiple times.

**4. Incorrect implementation of the topological sort**

A topological sort is a linear ordering of the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge `(u, v)`, vertex `u` comes before vertex `v` in the ordering. The topological sort can be used to find the number of DAGs in a graph.

The topological sort can be implemented incorrectly in a number of ways. One common mistake is to forget to check if the graph is acyclic. If the graph is not acyclic, then there will be no topological sort.

Another common mistake is to forget to handle the case where the graph has multiple edges between two vertices. In this case, the topological sort will need to handle the edges in a specific order.

**5. Incorrect implementation of the Kosaraju's algorithm**

Kosaraju's algorithm is a linear-time algorithm for finding the strongly connected components of a directed graph. The strongly connected components of a graph are the maximal subgraphs of the graph that are both strongly connected and acyclic.

Kosaraju's algorithm can be implemented incorrectly in a number of ways. One common mistake is to forget to initialize the visited array to all false. This can lead to incorrect results, as the algorithm will then incorrectly mark some vertices as visited when they are not.

Another common mistake is to forget to check if the graph is connected. If the graph is not connected, then the algorithm will not find all of the strongly connected components.

**6. Incorrect implementation of the Tarjan's algorithm**

Tarjan's algorithm is a linear-time algorithm for finding the bridges and articulation points of a directed graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal would disconnect the graph, and an articulation point is a vertex whose removal would disconnect the graph.

Tarjan's algorithm can be implemented incorrectly in a number of ways. One common mistake is to forget to initialize the low pointer to -1. This can lead to incorrect results, as the algorithm will then incorrectly mark some vertices as articulation points when they are not.

Another common mistake is to forget to check if the graph is connected. If the graph is not connected, then the algorithm will not find

Title:
ATCODER p03963 AtCoder Beginner Contest 046 - Painting Balls with AtCoDeer

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input states that `N` and `K` are at most `1000`. However, if you use an integer data type to store these values, you may run into an overflow error. To avoid this, you should use a larger data type, such as a long integer.

**2. Using an incorrect formula**

The formula for the number of ways to paint the balls is `(K-1)! * (K-1)!`. However, if you forget to subtract 1 from `K` in either of the factorials, you will get the wrong answer.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When counting the number of ways to paint the balls, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, if you forget to include the case where the first and last balls are painted the same color, you will get the wrong answer.

**4. Using an inefficient algorithm**

The naive algorithm for solving this problem would be to enumerate all possible ways to paint the balls and then count the number of ways that satisfy the constraints. However, this algorithm would be very inefficient, as it would have to consider a very large number of possibilities.

A more efficient algorithm would be to use dynamic programming. This algorithm would build up a table of the number of ways to paint the balls for each possible number of balls and colors. This table could then be used to quickly find the answer to the problem.

AIZU p00054 Sum of Nth decimal places

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for `a`, `b`, or `n`.** This could result in incorrect results or errors. For example, if `a` is a string instead of an integer, the program will not be able to divide `a` by `b` correctly.
2. **Using the wrong formula for `f(i)`.** The formula for `f(i)` is `a / b * 10^i`, where `i` is the index of the fraction. If the formula is incorrect, the program will not produce the correct output.
3. **Using an incorrect loop to iterate over the fractions.** The loop should iterate from `i = 1` to `i = n`. If the loop is incorrect, the program will not sum all of the fractions correctly.
4. **Not using the correct data type for `s`.** `s` should be a floating-point number, since it represents a sum of fractions. If `s` is an integer, the program will not produce the correct output.
5. **Not printing the output correctly.** The output should be a single line containing the value of `s`. If the output is not formatted correctly, the program will not produce the correct output.
6. **Using an infinite loop.** The loop to iterate over the fractions should have a terminating condition. If the loop does not have a terminating condition, it will run forever and the program will not terminate.

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain a negative number or a number that is greater than 120. The developer should check the input format and handle invalid input appropriately.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not always correct. For example, the output may contain a number that is not an integer or a number that is not in the range of 0 to 7. The developer should check the output format and handle invalid output appropriately.
* **Off-by-one errors:** The developer may accidentally miscount the number of visitors or the number of people in each age group. This can lead to incorrect results. The developer should carefully check their code to avoid off-by-one errors.
* **Memory leaks:** The developer may accidentally create a memory leak. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash. The developer should use a memory management tool to check for memory leaks.
* **Race conditions:** The developer may accidentally create a race condition. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or to crash. The developer should use a thread-safe programming library to avoid race conditions.
* **Security vulnerabilities:** The developer may accidentally introduce a security vulnerability. This can allow attackers to access sensitive data or to take control of the program. The developer should use secure coding practices to avoid security vulnerabilities.

1. The input format is not well defined. For example, the input "100 2 2 2" can be interpreted as "100 2 2 2" or "100 2 2 2 0".
2. The output format is not well defined. For example, the output "20" can be interpreted as "20" or "20\n".
3. The program is not robust. For example, it will crash if the input contains invalid data.
4. The program is not efficient. For example, it sorts the list of secret artists and the list of standard artists twice.
5. The program is not modular. For example, the logic for selecting artists is not separated from the logic for printing the output.

Here are some possible solutions to these problems:

1. The input format can be defined more strictly. For example, the input can be required to have exactly four lines, and each line can be required to have exactly three elements.
2. The output format can be defined more strictly. For example, the output can be required to be a single integer.
3. The program can be made more robust by checking for invalid input. For example, the program can check that the input values are within the valid ranges.
4. The program can be made more efficient by sorting the lists of secret artists and standard artists only once.
5. The program can be made more modular by separating the logic for selecting artists from the logic for printing the output.

Title:
AIZU p01556 ConvexCut

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the number of vertices is not specified in the first line, the program may not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong type, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. For example, if the coordinates of the vertices are specified as strings, the program may not be able to correctly calculate the area of the polygon.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program may contain logical errors, which may cause it to produce incorrect results. For example, if the program does not correctly account for all possible cases, it may produce incorrect results for some inputs.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The program may make off-by-one errors, which may cause it to produce incorrect results. For example, if the program calculates the area of the polygon one vertex too few, it will produce an incorrect result.
5. **Floating-point errors**. The program may produce floating-point errors, which may cause it to produce incorrect results. For example, if the program calculates the area of the polygon with a precision of 10 digits, it may produce an incorrect result if the actual area is not exactly representable with 10 digits of precision.
6. **Memory errors**. The program may run out of memory, which may cause it to crash. For example, if the program tries to store too much data in memory, it may run out of memory and crash.
7. **Timeout errors**. The program may take too long to run, which may cause it to time out. For example, if the program is asked to solve a very large problem, it may take too long to run and time out.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may contain security vulnerabilities, which may allow attackers to exploit the program to gain unauthorized access to the system. For example, if the program allows users to input arbitrary data, attackers may be able to input malicious code that could be executed by the program.

Title:
AIZU p01711 Idempotent Filter

Pain points:
**Possible Problems and Bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, the input should not contain spaces between digits, and the input should end with a single '#'.
* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm:** The algorithm for determining whether a filter is idempotent is not trivial, and it is easy to make a mistake when implementing it. For example, it is important to correctly handle the case where the filter outputs the same value for all possible inputs.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output should be a single line that says "yes" if the filter is idempotent, or "no" otherwise. It is important to make sure that the output is formatted correctly, and that it does not contain any typos.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems and bugs:

* **Be careful when reading the input:** Make sure that you understand the input format, and that you are correctly reading the input data.
* **Test your implementation of the algorithm:** Write unit tests to verify that your implementation of the algorithm is correct.
* **Check your output format:** Make sure that your output is formatted correctly, and that it does not contain any typos.

    t_i -= 1
    t_j += 1

print(s_i, s_j, t_i, t_j)
```

## Possible problems

1. The input format is not specified clearly. For example, it is not clear whether the input should be in the form of `H W` or `H, W`.
2. The output format is not specified clearly. For example, it is not clear whether the output should be in the form of `s_i s_j t_i t_j` or `(s_i, s_j), (t_i, t_j)`.
3. The problem statement does not specify what to do if there is no house in the town.
4. The problem statement does not specify what to do if the typhoon does not move.
5. The problem statement does not specify what to do if the typhoon moves outside the town.

## Possible bugs

1. The program may not handle the case where the input format is not correct.
2. The program may not handle the case where the output format is not correct.
3. The program may not handle the case where there is no house in the town.
4. The program may not handle the case where the typhoon does not move.
5. The program may not handle the case where the typhoon moves outside the town.

## Solutions

1. To avoid problems with the input format, the program can first check that the input is in the correct format. If the input is not in the correct format, the program can exit with an error message.
2. To avoid problems with the output format, the program can first check that the output is in the correct format. If the output is not in the correct format, the program can exit with an error message.

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly initializing the state.** The state is initialized to all OFF flags, but if the developer forgets to do this, the results of the test, all, any, none, count, and val operations will be incorrect.
* **Misusing the test, set, clear, flip, all, any, none, count, and val operations.** The developer must be careful to use these operations correctly, or the results will be incorrect. For example, the test operation should be used to check if a particular flag is ON, the set operation should be used to set a particular flag to ON, the clear operation should be used to set a particular flag to OFF, the flip operation should be used to invert the value of a particular flag, the all operation should be used to check if all flags are ON, the any operation should be used to check if at least one flag is ON, the none operation should be used to check if all flags are OFF, the count operation should be used to count the number of ON flags, and the val operation should be used to print the decimal value of the state.
* **Incorrectly handling invalid input.** The input may contain invalid queries, such as queries with invalid values or queries that are not in the correct format. The developer must be careful to handle these invalid queries correctly, or the program will crash or produce incorrect output.
* **Incorrectly implementing the algorithm.** The algorithm for solving this problem is relatively simple, but the developer must be careful to implement it correctly, or the program will run slowly or produce incorrect output.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems and bugs:

* Carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements.
* Make sure to initialize the state correctly.
* Carefully use the test, set, clear, flip, all, any, none, count, and val operations.
* Handle invalid input correctly.
* Implement the algorithm correctly.
* Test your program thoroughly to catch any errors.
