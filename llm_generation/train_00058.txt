CODECHEF axr1p2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not specified in the problem statement. A developer may incorrectly assume that the input format is `int` and get a `ValueError` when trying to parse a string.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the unit place digit**. The unit place digit of a number can be calculated by taking the remainder of the number when divided by 10. A developer may incorrectly calculate the unit place digit by taking the modulo of the number by 10.
3. **Off-by-one error**. A developer may incorrectly calculate the unit place digit by one. For example, they may calculate the unit place digit of `10` as `1` instead of `0`.
4. **Infinite loop**. A developer may incorrectly write a loop that never terminates. This can happen if the developer does not check the condition for exiting the loop.
5. **Memory leak**. A developer may incorrectly allocate memory that is never freed. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
6. **Security vulnerability**. A developer may incorrectly implement the program in a way that allows a malicious user to exploit a security vulnerability. For example, the developer may allow a user to input arbitrary data that is then used to calculate the unit place digit. This could allow a malicious user to inject code into the program or to access sensitive data.

Title:
CODECHEF cmb01

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly reversing the numbers.** The most common mistake is to reverse the numbers incorrectly. For example, if the number is 1234, it should be reversed to 4321, but some people might reverse it to 1432. This will result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Not handling leading zeros correctly.** The problem statement states that "all the leading zeros are omitted". This means that if the number ends with a zero, the zero is lost by reversing (e.g. 1200 gives 21). Some people might forget to do this, which will also result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Not handling the case where the sum of the two reversed numbers is greater than 9.** The problem statement states that "the reversed number never has any trailing zeros". This means that if the sum of the two reversed numbers is greater than 9, the answer should be a number with no leading zeros. Some people might forget to do this, which will also result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Using incorrect data types.** The problem statement states that the input numbers are positive integers. Some people might use incorrect data types, such as strings or floats, which will result in an incorrect answer.
5. **Not handling errors correctly.** The problem statement does not specify what should happen if there is an error. Some people might not handle errors correctly, which could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements. It is also important to test your code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct.

Title:
CODECHEF flow011

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The problem states that the input is an integer, but the solution code uses a float variable to store the input. This will cause the program to produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The problem states that the HRA is 10% of the basic salary if the basic salary is less than Rs. 1500, and Rs. 500 if the basic salary is equal to or above Rs. 1500. The solution code incorrectly calculates the HRA as 10% of the basic salary for all salaries.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The problem states that the output should be a single integer, but the solution code prints the output as a float.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The solution code subtracts 1 from the input salary when checking if the salary is less than Rs. 1500. This means that the HRA will be calculated incorrectly for salaries that are exactly equal to Rs. 1500.
5. **Use of global variables**. The solution code uses a global variable to store the HRA rate. This is a bad practice because it makes the code more difficult to read and maintain.
6. **Unnecessary code**. The solution code includes a lot of unnecessary code, such as the `if` statement that checks if the salary is less than Rs. 1500. This code could be removed without affecting the correctness of the program.

To avoid these problems, the following steps should be taken:

1. Use the correct variable type for the input.
2. Correctly calculate the HRA and DA.
3. Use the correct output format.
4. Avoid off-by-one errors.
5. Do not use global variables.
6. Remove unnecessary code.

Pain points:
1. The input format is not clear. Is the input a list of lists? Or a list of tuples? Or a list of strings?
2. The output format is not clear. Is the output a single integer? Or a list of integers?
3. The problem statement is not clear. What does "the Little Elephant is going to listen all the songs exactly once in some order" mean?
4. The problem statement is not clear. What does "the sweetness of the song is equal to the product of the length of that song and the number of different bands listened before (including the current playing song)" mean?
5. The problem statement is not clear. What does "Help the Little Elephant to find the order that maximizes the total sweetness of all N songs" mean?

Title:
CODECHEF ppxor

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the XOR operation.** The XOR operation is a bitwise operation that takes two numbers as input and returns a third number that is the result of performing the XOR operation on each bit of the two input numbers. For example, if the two input numbers are 0010 and 1100, the XOR operation will result in the number 1110. It is important to note that the XOR operation is not commutative, which means that the order of the input numbers matters. In the example above, the XOR of 1100 and 0010 would result in the number 0000.
2. **Incorrect handling of negative numbers.** The XOR operation is not defined for negative numbers. If a negative number is passed to the XOR operation, the result will be undefined.
3. **Incorrect handling of zero.** The XOR operation of any number with zero is the same number. For example, the XOR of 5 and 0 is 5, and the XOR of -5 and 0 is -5.
4. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The XOR operation can overflow if the two input numbers are too large. For example, if the two input numbers are 2147483647 and 1, the XOR operation will overflow and result in the number -2147483648.
5. **Incorrect handling of carry.** The XOR operation can generate a carry if the two input numbers have different signs. For example, if the two input numbers are 10 and -10, the XOR operation will generate a carry of 1.
6. **Incorrect handling of leading zeros.** The XOR operation does not care about leading zeros in the input numbers. For example, the XOR of 0001 and 0010 is the same as the XOR of 1 and 10.
7. **Incorrect handling of trailing zeros.** The XOR operation does not care about trailing zeros in the input numbers. For example, the XOR of 1000 and 0001 is the same as the XOR of 1 and 1.
8. **Incorrect handling of the sign bit.** The XOR operation does not care about the sign bit in the input numbers. For example, the XOR of -1 and 1 is the same as the XOR of 1 and -1.

Title:
CODECHEF sumtrian

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always strictly followed. For example, the input may contain spaces between numbers, or the numbers may be separated by tabs or other characters. The developer should make sure to handle all possible input formats correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not always strictly followed. For example, the output may contain spaces between numbers, or the numbers may be separated by tabs or other characters. The developer should make sure to output the results in the correct format.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating over the rows of the triangle, it is easy to make an off-by-one error and miss a number or include an extra number. The developer should be careful to check the indices of the rows and columns to make sure that they are correct.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the sums**. When calculating the sums of the numbers in the triangle, it is easy to make a mistake and add the wrong numbers together. The developer should be careful to make sure that the sums are calculated correctly.
5. **Memory leaks**. When allocating memory for the triangle, it is easy to create a memory leak. The developer should make sure to free all of the memory that is allocated.
6. **Incorrect handling of errors**. The program should be able to handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input file does not exist, the program should print an error message and exit.
7. **Inefficient algorithms**. The program should be as efficient as possible. For example, the program should use a dynamic programming algorithm to calculate the sums of the numbers in the triangle.

Title:
CODEFORCES 100_J. Interval Coloring

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n, which is the number of intervals. However, if the input format is incorrect, such as if the first line contains two integers instead of one, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format specifies that the output should be a single integer k, which is the minimum number of colors needed for a nice coloring. However, if the output is not a single integer, such as if it is a string or a list of integers, the program will crash.

**3. Mismatch between input and output**

The input specifies that there are n intervals. However, if the program outputs a value that is not equal to n, the program will crash.

**4. Incorrect logic**

The program's logic must be correct in order to find the minimum number of colors needed for a nice coloring. If the logic is incorrect, the program will output an incorrect answer.

**5. Runtime error**

The program must be able to run to completion in a reasonable amount of time. If the program takes too long to run, it will time out and crash.

**6. Memory error**

The program must not use too much memory. If the program uses too much memory, it will crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1033_G. Chip Game

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect variable type

The input format is `n,m`, where `n` is the number of piles and `m` is the upper bound on the number of chips allowed to be taken in one turn. However, the code below incorrectly defines `n` and `m` as strings. This will cause a `TypeError` when the code tries to convert `n` and `m` to integers.

```python
n, m = input().split()
```

The correct way to define `n` and `m` is as follows:

```python
n, m = int(input()), int(input())
```

### 2. Missing `else` statement

The code below incorrectly checks if `a == b`. If `a == b`, the code will print `"Alice wins"` and then exit the program. However, if `a != b`, the code will not print anything and will continue to execute. This is a bug because the code should print `"Bob wins"` if `a != b`.

```python
if a == b:
    print("Alice wins")
    exit()
```

The correct way to check if `a == b` is to use the `else` statement. The following code will print `"Alice wins"` if `a == b` and `"Bob wins"` if `a != b`.

```python
if a == b:
    print("Alice wins")
else:
    print("Bob wins")
```

### 3. Using the wrong variable

The code below incorrectly uses the variable `i` to index the array `piles`. This is a bug because `i` is the number of piles, not the index of a pile. This will cause the code to access the array out of bounds.

```python
for i in range(n):
    piles[i] -= 1
```

The correct way to use the variable `i` is to index the array `piles` using the expression `i - 1`. The following code will correctly decrement the values in the array `piles`.

```python
for i in range(n):
    piles[i - 1] -= 1
```

### 4. Using `else` without an `if` statement

The code below incorrectly uses the `else` statement without an `if` statement. This is a bug because the `else` statement will always be executed, even if the condition in the `if` statement is not true. This will cause the code to print `"Alice wins"` even if Bob wins the game.

```python
if a == b:
    print("Alice wins")
else:
    print("Alice wins")
```

The correct way to use the `else` statement is to put it after an `if` statement. The following code will only print `"Alice wins"` if the condition in the `if` statement is true.

```python
if a == b:
    print("Alice wins")
else:
    print("Bob wins")
```

CODEFORCES 1056_E. Check Transcription

Pain points:
 * "kokoko", "lin"  * "kokokoko", "tin" 



The following are possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrectly counting the number of possible replacements.** The developer may forget to take into account the fact that the strings `r_0` and `r_1` must be different and non-empty. This can lead to an incorrect answer.
2. **Using an incorrect algorithm to find the possible replacements.** The developer may use an algorithm that is not efficient enough, which can lead to a time limit exceeded error.
3. **Mishandling the input data.** The developer may not properly handle the input data, which can lead to a runtime error.
4. **Incorrectly formatting the output.** The developer may not correctly format the output, which can lead to a presentation error.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements. They should then develop a clear and concise solution that takes into account all of the constraints. The developer should also test their solution thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly.

CODEFORCES 107_A. Dorm Water Supply

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or the input may not have the correct number of lines.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed. For example, the output may contain a number that is not an integer, or the output may not have the correct number of lines.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect. For example, the program may not find all of the tank-tap pairs, or the program may not find the maximum amount of water that can be conveyed from each tank to its corresponding tap.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program may not free up memory that it has allocated. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
5. **Race conditions**. The program may not be thread-safe. This can lead to incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may not be secure. This can allow attackers to gain access to sensitive data or to execute arbitrary code on the system.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1099_F. Cookies

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The tree traversal algorithm should visit all vertices of the tree in a specific order, such as preorder, postorder, or inorder.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the time required to move the chip from one vertex to another.** The time required to move the chip from one vertex to another is equal to the sum of the edge weights along the path from the first vertex to the second vertex.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the time required to eat cookies in a vertex.** The time required to eat cookies in a vertex is equal to the product of the number of cookies in the vertex and the time required to eat one cookie.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of cookies that Mitya can eat.** The maximum number of cookies that Mitya can eat is equal to the minimum of the following values:
    * The total number of cookies in the tree.
    * The time available to Mitya.
    * The time required to move the chip from the root of the tree to the leaf with the most cookies.
5. **Incorrect handling of edge removals.** Vasya can remove edges from the tree during the game. If an edge is removed, the time required to move the chip from one vertex to another may change. The developer must take this into account when calculating the maximum number of cookies that Mitya can eat.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as expected. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as expected. For example, the output may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not find the longest simple path, or it may find a path that is not simple.
4. **Incorrect data**. The data used to test the program may be incorrect. For example, the data may contain two cells that are in the same row or column, or the data may contain two cells that are not in the same rectangle.
5. **Runtime error**. The program may crash or produce an incorrect output due to a runtime error. For example, the program may run out of memory, or it may divide by zero.
6. **Logic error**. The program may produce an incorrect output due to a logic error. For example, the program may assume that two cells are adjacent when they are not, or it may assume that two cells are not adjacent when they are.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the program thoroughly with a variety of different data sets.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1168_C. And Reachability

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input contains integers, so we need to make sure that we use the correct data types when reading the input and storing the values. For example, if we read the input as strings and then try to perform bitwise operations on them, we will get a runtime error.

**2. Using incorrect bitwise operators**

The problem statement specifies that we need to use the bitwise AND operator (&#&amp;) to check if two integers are reachable. However, if we accidentally use the bitwise OR operator (&#124;) or the bitwise XOR operator (^), we will get incorrect results.

**3. Forgetting to initialize variables**

When we declare a variable, we need to make sure to initialize it with a value. If we don't initialize a variable, it will contain garbage data, which can lead to incorrect results.

**4. Using incorrect loop conditions**

When we iterate over a range of values, we need to make sure that we use the correct loop conditions. For example, if we iterate over a range of integers from 1 to n, but n is not a positive integer, we will get a runtime error.

**5. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement specifies that n and q must be positive integers. However, if we accidentally input a negative value for n or q, our program will not handle this case correctly and will probably crash.

**6. Using incorrect code formatting**

When we write code, we need to make sure that it is properly formatted. This makes it easier for other people to read and understand our code, and it also helps to prevent errors.

**7. Not testing your code**

Before submitting your code, it is important to test it thoroughly. This will help you to catch any errors that you may have missed.
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect data types**

```
n, q = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
for _ in range(q):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if a[x] & a[y] > 0:
        print('Shi')
    else:
        print('Fou')
```

This code will not work because the input is a list of integers, but we are trying to use the bitwise AND operator on strings. This will cause a runtime error.

2. **Incorrect bitwise operators**

```
n, q = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
for _ in range(q):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if a[x] | a[y] > 0:
        print('Shi')
    else:
        print('Fou')
```

This code will not work because the bitwise OR operator is not the same as the bitwise AND operator. The bitwise OR operator returns a 1 if either of the operands is a 1, while the bitwise AND operator returns a 1 only if both of the operands are a 1.

3. **Forgetting to initialize variables**

```
n, q = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
for _ in range(q):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if a[x] & a[y] > 0:
        print('Shi')
    else:
        print('Fou')
```

This code will not work because the variable `i` is not initialized before it is used in the loop condition. This will cause a runtime error.

4. **Using incorrect loop conditions**

```
n, q = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
for i in range(1, n+1):
    for j in range(i+1, n+1):
        if a[i] & a[j] > 0:
            print('Shi')
        else:
            print('Fou')
```

This code will not work because the loop condition is incorrect. The loop should iterate over all pairs of integers from 1 to n, not all integers from i to n.

5. **Not handling edge cases**

```
n, q = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
for _ in range(q):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if x < y and a[x] & a[y] > 0:
        print('Shi')
    else:
        print('Fou')
```

This code will not work because it does not handle the case where x and y are equal. In this case, the program will print `Fou`, even though x is reachable from y.

6. **Using incorrect code formatting**

```
n, q = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
for _ in range(q):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if (x < y and a[x] & a[y] > 0):
        print('Shi')
    else:
        print('Fou')
```

This code is not properly formatted. It is difficult to read and understand, and it is more likely to contain errors.

7. **Not testing your code**

```
n, q = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
for _ in range(q):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if a[x] & a[y] > 0:
        print('Shi')
    else:
        print('Fou')
```

This code has not been tested. It is likely to contain errors that will not be caught until it is run on a test case.

Here are some program inputs that will validate whether an implementation meets each of the requirements listed above

CODEFORCES 1186_F. Vus the Cossack and a Graph

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the first line of the input may contain more than two integers, or the second line may contain less than two integers.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the first line of the output may contain more than one integer, or the second line may contain more than two integers.

**3. Incorrect data type**

The data type of the input and output may not be correct. For example, the input may contain a string instead of an integer, or the output may contain a float instead of an integer.

**4. Undefined behavior**

The program may behave in an undefined way, such as crashing or entering an infinite loop. This may happen due to a number of reasons, such as a division by zero, a dereference of a null pointer, or an array access out of bounds.

**5. Memory leaks**

The program may not free the memory that it allocates. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash.

**6. Security vulnerabilities**

The program may contain security vulnerabilities, such as a buffer overflow or a SQL injection vulnerability. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or to the system on which it is running.

**7. Performance issues**

The program may run slowly or inefficiently. This may be due to a number of reasons, such as a poor algorithm choice, a lack of optimization, or a poorly designed data structure.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1205_E. Expected Value Again

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the expected value formula.** The expected value of f(s)^2 is given by the following formula:

```
E[f(s)^2] = \sum_{i=0}^n {n \choose i} \frac{1}{k^i} \frac{1}{k^{n-i}} = \frac{1}{k^n} \sum_{i=0}^n {n \choose i} (k^i)^2
```

This formula can be easily implemented using the binomial coefficient formula and the power rule for exponentiation. However, it is important to be careful about the order of operations, as the exponentiation operator has higher precedence than the multiplication operator. For example, the following code would produce the wrong answer:

```
expected_value = 0
for i in range(n+1):
    expected_value += binomial_coefficient(n, i) * (k**i)**2
```

The correct implementation would be:

```
expected_value = 0
for i in range(n+1):
    expected_value += binomial_coefficient(n, i) * (k**i) * (k**i)
```

2. **Incorrect implementation of the modular inverse function.** The modular inverse of a number a modulo m is the number x such that a*x = 1 mod m. This number can be found using the extended Euclidean algorithm. However, it is important to be careful about the range of the modulo operation, as it is possible to overflow the integer type. For example, the following code would produce the wrong answer:

```
modular_inverse = pow(a, -1, m)
```

The correct implementation would be:

```
modular_inverse = pow(a, -1, m) % m
```

3. **Incorrect casting of the modular inverse.** The modular inverse of a number a modulo m is always a number between 0 and m-1. However, it is possible to accidentally cast the modular inverse to a larger type, which would produce the wrong answer. For example, the following code would produce the wrong answer:

```
print(int(modular_inverse))
```

The correct implementation would be:

```
print(modular_inverse)
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 1223_B. Strings Equalization

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type**

The input strings are of type `string`, but the problem statement specifies that they consist of lowercase Latin letters. This means that we can only use characters from the `a-z` range. If we try to use a character outside of this range, such as `#`, we will get an error.

**2. Using the wrong comparison operator**

The problem statement specifies that we need to check if the two strings are equal. We can do this using the `==` operator. However, if we accidentally use the `!=` operator, we will get the wrong answer.

**3. Not handling the case where the two strings are not equal**

The problem statement states that we need to check if it is possible to transform `s` into `t`. However, if the two strings are not equal, then it is not possible to transform one into the other. We need to make sure to handle this case and return `NO`.

**4. Not handling the case where the two strings are empty**

The problem statement does not specify what to do if the two strings are empty. We need to make sure to handle this case and return `YES`.

**5. Not handling the case where the two strings are the same**

The problem statement does not specify what to do if the two strings are the same. We need to make sure to handle this case and return `YES`.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1248_E. Queue in the Train

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the queue data structure.** The queue should be implemented as a doubly linked list, so that both the front and the back of the queue can be accessed in O(1) time. A simple array-based implementation of the queue will not work correctly, as it will not be possible to efficiently insert and remove elements from the middle of the queue.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the priority queue data structure.** The priority queue should be implemented as a heap, so that the element with the highest priority can be accessed in O(1) time. A simple array-based implementation of the priority queue will not work correctly, as it will not be possible to efficiently insert and remove elements from the middle of the queue.
3. **Incorrect use of the `max()` and `min()` functions.** The `max()` and `min()` functions should only be used to compare two values of the same type. If you try to compare two values of different types, the compiler will generate a compiler error.
4. **Incorrect use of the `sort()` function.** The `sort()` function should only be used to sort a list of values of the same type. If you try to sort a list of values of different types, the compiler will generate a compiler error.
5. **Incorrect use of the `nth_element()` function.** The `nth_element()` function should only be used to find the nth smallest element in a list of values. If you try to find the nth largest element in a list of values, the compiler will generate a compiler error.
6. **Incorrect use of the `upper_bound()` and `lower_bound()` functions.** The `upper_bound()` and `lower_bound()` functions should only be used to find the first element in a list that is greater than or equal to a given value, and the first element in a list that is less than or equal to a given value, respectively. If you try to find the last element in a list that is greater than or equal to a given value, or the last element in a list that is less than or equal to a given value, the compiler will generate a compiler error.
7. **Incorrect use of the `binary_search()` function.** The `binary_search()` function should only be used to find an element in a sorted list. If you try to find an element in an unsorted list, the compiler will generate a compiler error.
8. **Incorrect use of the `next_permutation()` function.** The `next_permutation()` function should only be used to generate the next lexicographically smaller permutation of a list of values. If you try to generate the next lexicographically larger permutation of a list of values, the compiler will generate a compiler error.
9. **Incorrect use of the `prev_permutation()` function.** The `prev_permutation()` function should only be used to generate the next lexicographically larger permutation of a list of values. If you try to generate the next lexicographically smaller permutation of a list of values, the compiler will generate a compiler error.
10. **Incorrect use of the `rotate()` function.** The `rotate()` function should only be used to rotate a list of values to the left or to the right. If you try to rotate a list of values in any other direction, the compiler will generate a compiler error.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1267_D. DevOps Best Practices

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake. For example, missing a space between two integers, or using a different separator character.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake. For example, missing a newline character, or using a different separator character.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the solution is the most important part, and it is easy to make a mistake here. For example, forgetting to check if a feature is already deployed on a server, or deploying a feature to a server that does not want it.
4. **Memory leaks**. The solution should not allocate any memory that is not freed at the end. This is a common mistake that can be difficult to debug.
5. **Synchronization issues**. The solution should be thread-safe, if it is used in a multi-threaded environment. This is a difficult problem to get right, and it is easy to make mistakes.
6. **Performance issues**. The solution should be efficient, and it should not take too long to run. This is especially important if the solution is used in a production environment.
7. **Code quality**. The solution should be well-written and easy to read. This makes it easier to debug and maintain, and it also makes it more likely that other developers will be able to use it.

**How to avoid these problems and bugs:**

1. **Use a good editor**. A good editor can help you catch errors in your code. For example, it can check for incorrect syntax, and it can warn you about potential problems.
2. **Test your code**. Always test your code before you deploy it to production. This will help you catch bugs before they cause problems.
3. **Use a debugger**. A debugger can help you track down errors in your code. This is especially useful when the errors are hard to find.
4. **Read the documentation**. The documentation for the programming language and libraries that you are using can help you avoid mistakes.
5. **Ask for help**. If you are stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help. There are many online resources available, and there are also people who are willing to help you.

By following these tips, you can avoid many of the problems and bugs that developers commonly encounter when solving problems.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1288_E. Messenger Simulator

Pain points:



 So, for example, the positions of the friend 1 are 1, 1, 2, 4, respectively. Out of these 1 is the minimum one and 4 is the maximum one. Thus, the answer for the friend 1 is a pair (1, 4). **1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correctly parsed by the program. This can lead to errors in the output. For example, if the input contains a space between two integers, the program may interpret them as two separate integers.

To avoid this problem, make sure that the input format is correct.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also important. The program must output the results in the correct format. For example, if the output contains a comma between two integers, the program may interpret them as two separate integers.

To avoid this problem, make sure that the output format is correct.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The program must implement the correct logic to solve the problem. For example, if the program does not consider all possible cases, the output may be incorrect.

To avoid this problem, carefully review the logic of the program.

**4. Incorrect data types**

The program must use the correct data types for the input and output values. For example, if the input values are integers, the program must use the `int` data type.

To avoid this problem, make sure that the data types are correct.

**5. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that can occur when programming. This type of error occurs when the program does not account for all possible cases. For example, if the program is supposed to find the minimum value in an array, but it does not account for the case where the array is empty, the program will return an incorrect value.

To avoid this problem, carefully review the program for off-by-one errors.

Title:
CODEFORCES 130_E. Tribonacci numbers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulo operation.** The modulo operation is often used in problems like this one, but it's important to make sure that you're using it correctly. In this problem, we need to find the remainder of the nth tribonacci number when divided by 26. This means that we need to use the following formula:

```
n % 26
```

where `n` is the nth tribonacci number.

2. **Off-by-one errors.** It's easy to make a mistake when calculating the nth tribonacci number. One common mistake is to forget to add 1 to the index when calculating the previous two terms. For example, if you're trying to calculate the 5th tribonacci number, you might forget to add 1 to the index when calculating the 3rd and 4th terms, which would result in an incorrect answer.

3. **Incorrect initialization.** It's important to initialize the first three terms of the tribonacci sequence correctly. The first three terms are 0, 0, and 1, so we need to make sure that we set `t0`, `t1`, and `t2` to these values before we start calculating the nth tribonacci number.

4. **Incorrect recursion.** If you're using recursion to solve this problem, it's important to make sure that your recursive function is correct. One common mistake is to forget to return the value of the nth tribonacci number.

5. **Incorrect output.** It's important to make sure that you're outputting the nth tribonacci number correctly. In this problem, we need to output the remainder of the nth tribonacci number when divided by 26. This means that we need to use the following format:

```
n % 26
```

where `n` is the nth tribonacci number.
Test inputs:

Title:
CODEFORCES 1331_H. It's showtime

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is `1000 * n + mod`, where `1 ≤ n, mod ≤ 999`. If the input format is incorrect, the developer may get a `SyntaxError` or a `ValueError`.
2. **Incorrect calculation of double factorial**. The double factorial of a number `n` is defined as `n!! = n * (n-2) * ... * 2`. If the developer incorrectly calculates the double factorial, the output will be incorrect.
3. **Modulo arithmetic errors**. When calculating the double factorial modulo `mod`, the developer must be careful to avoid modulo arithmetic errors. For example, if `n` is a multiple of `mod`, then `n!!` will be zero modulo `mod`.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. When calculating the double factorial, the developer must be careful to avoid off-by-one errors. For example, if `n` is equal to `1000`, then `n!!` is equal to `1000 * 998 * ... * 2`. However, if the developer mistakenly calculates `n!!` as `1000 * 999 * ... * 2`, the output will be incorrect.
5. **Other errors**. There are a number of other possible errors that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the developer may incorrectly use the `input()` function, or they may incorrectly use the `%` operator.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that they understand the input format and the output format. The developer should also carefully write their code and test it thoroughly to ensure that it is correct.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, a test case may contain more than two integers, or a test case may contain non-integer values. The developer should check the input format and handle incorrect input gracefully.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the k-th positive integer that is not divisible by n.** The developer may incorrectly calculate the k-th positive integer that is not divisible by n. For example, the developer may forget to add 1 to the answer, or the developer may incorrectly calculate the remainder of the k-th positive integer divided by n.
3. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not always correctly followed. For example, the developer may print the answer in the wrong format, or the developer may print the answer multiple times. The developer should check the output format and handle incorrect output gracefully.
4. **Other bugs.** There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the developer may incorrectly use a data structure, or the developer may incorrectly handle an edge case. The developer should carefully test their code to find and fix any bugs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1487_B. Cat Cycle

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect variable type**

The input format specifies that `n` and `k` are integers. However, the code below uses `int` for `n` and `long long` for `k`. This will cause an error when `n` is larger than `2147483647`.

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    print(k % n)
```

The correct code should use `long long` for both `n` and `k`.

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(long long, input().split())
    print(k % n)
```

**2. Incorrect modulo operator**

The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder of a division. This means that `n % k` will always be less than `k`. However, the problem statement specifies that `k` can be as large as `10^9`. This means that `n % k` could be negative.

The code below uses `n % k` to calculate the index of the spot where cat B will sleep. However, this could result in an incorrect answer if `n % k` is negative.

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    print(n % k)
```

The correct code should use the absolute value of `n % k` to calculate the index of the spot where cat B will sleep.

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    print(abs(n % k))
```

**3. Incorrect loop condition**

The code below uses a for loop to iterate over the values of `k` from 1 to `n`. However, the problem statement specifies that `k` can be as large as `10^9`. This means that the loop will never terminate.

```
for k in range(1, n + 1):
    print(k % n)
```

The correct code should use a for loop to iterate over the values of `k` from 1 to `10^9`.

```
for k in range(1, 10 ** 9 + 1):
    print(k % n)
```

**4. Incorrect calculation of cat B's spot**

The code below uses the following formula to calculate the index of the spot where cat B will sleep:

```
catBSpot = (k + n - 1) % n
```

However, this formula is incorrect. The correct formula is:

```
catBSpot = (k + n - 1) % (n + 1)
```

The reason for this is that the problem statement specifies that cat B's spot can be as large as `n`. This means that the formula `(k + n - 1) % n` could result in a negative value. The formula `(k + n - 1) % (n + 1)` will always result in a value that is less than or equal to `n`.

Title:
CODEFORCES 185_E. Soap Time! - 2

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct.**

The input format of the problem is as follows:

```
The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ k ≤ 105) — the number of dwarves and the number of subway stations, correspondingly.

The next n lines contain the coordinates of the dwarves. The i-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 108) — the coordinates of the i-th dwarf. It is guaranteed that all dwarves are located at different points.

The next k lines contain the coordinates of the subway stations. The t-th line contains two space-separated integers xt and yt (|xt|, |yt| ≤ 108) — the coordinates of the t-th subway station. It is guaranteed that all subway stations are located at different points.
```

However, the following input format is not correct:

```
2 2
5 -3
-4 -5
-4 0
-3 -2
```

The input format should be `2 2` followed by `5 -3`, `-4 -5`, `-4 0`, and `-3 -2`.

**2. The output format is not correct.**

The output format of the problem is as follows:

```
Print a single number — the minimum time, in which all dwarves can gather together at one point to watch the soap.
```

However, the following output format is not correct:

```
2 2
5 -3
-4 -5
-4 0
-3 -2

6
```

The output format should be `6`.

**3. The program does not compute the correct answer.**

The program should compute the minimum time, in which all dwarves can gather together at one point to watch the soap. However, the following program does not compute the correct answer:

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())

dwarves = []
for _ in range(n):
    dwarves.append(list(map(int, input().split())))

stations = []
for _ in range(k):
    stations.append(list(map(int, input().split())))

# Compute the minimum distance between each dwarf and each station.
distances = [[0 for _ in range(k)] for _ in range(n)]
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(k):
        distances[i][j] = abs(dwarves[i][0] - stations[j][0]) + abs(dwarves[i][1] - stations[j][1])

# Find the minimum distance between any dwarf and any station.
min_distance = 10 ** 18
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(k):
        if distances[i][j] < min_distance:

**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to read the document identifier, or if you read the document identifier incorrectly, your program will not work correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output for this problem must be an integer from 1 to 3. If you output the wrong number, or if you output a non-integer value, your program will not be accepted.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic for this problem is fairly simple, but it's easy to make a mistake. For example, if you forget to check if the document identifier is valid, or if you incorrectly assign the document to a subject, your program will not work correctly.
4. **Memory leaks.** This problem does not require a lot of memory, but it's still possible to create a memory leak if you're not careful. For example, if you don't free the memory that you allocate, your program will eventually run out of memory and crash.
5. **Timeouts.** This problem does not have a time limit, but it's still possible to write a program that takes too long to run. For example, if you use a recursive algorithm to solve the problem, your program could take a very long time to run on large inputs.

CODEFORCES 257_E. Greedy Elevator

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement is quite long and detailed, so it is easy to miss some important details. For example, it is not immediately obvious that the elevator can only move one floor at a time.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the elevator algorithm.** The elevator algorithm is quite complex, and it is easy to make a mistake in its implementation. For example, it is important to correctly handle the case when the elevator is empty and nobody is waiting for it on any floor.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement contains a few edge cases that are easy to miss. For example, what happens if the elevator is on the top floor and there are people waiting for it on the bottom floor?
4. **Incorrect input/output formatting.** The problem statement specifies that the input and output should be formatted in a certain way. It is easy to make a mistake in this formatting, which can lead to the submission being rejected.
5. **Runtime errors.** The elevator algorithm can be quite computationally expensive, so it is important to optimize it as much as possible. For example, it is possible to use a priority queue to keep track of the people waiting for the elevator, which can significantly speed up the algorithm.
6. **Memory errors.** The elevator algorithm can also be quite memory intensive, so it is important to be careful about memory usage. For example, it is important to free up memory that is no longer needed.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 303_D. Rotatable Number

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains two integers n and x. n is the length of the number and x is the upper bound of the base. If we use the wrong data type to store these two integers, it may cause problems. For example, if we use int to store n and x, then n may overflow when n is large.

**2. Not handling the corner cases**

The input may contain some corner cases. For example, n may be 0 or 1. If we don't handle these corner cases properly, it may cause problems.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The problem asks us to find the largest b such that there is a positive "Rotatable Number" of length n under base b. We can use the following logic to solve this problem:

1. Start with b = 2.
2. While b < x, do the following:
    * Check if there is a positive "Rotatable Number" of length n under base b.
    * If there is such a number, then print b and stop.
    * Otherwise, increment b by 1.

If we use this logic, it may not work correctly. For example, if n is 5 and x is 8, then there is no positive "Rotatable Number" of length n under base 8. However, our logic will still print 8.

**4. Not using a robust algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the largest b such that there is a positive "Rotatable Number" of length n under base b. A robust algorithm should be able to find the correct answer even if the input is incorrect or incomplete.

**5. Not testing the code thoroughly**

It is important to test the code thoroughly before submitting it. This will help to catch any bugs that may be present in the code.

**6. Not using version control**

It is important to use version control when developing code. This will help to track changes to the code and to roll back to previous versions if necessary.

CODEFORCES 351_C. Jeff and Brackets

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**

The input format is "n m", followed by n integers and then m integers. The first integer n is the number of brackets, and the second integer m is the number of brackets in the sequence. The next n integers are the ai values, and the next m integers are the bi values.

**2. The output format is not correct**

The output format is a single integer, which is the minimum amount of ink Jeff needs to paint the sequence.

**3. The code does not compute the minimum amount of ink**

The code should compute the minimum amount of ink Jeff needs to paint the sequence. This can be done by finding the minimum value of ai + bi for all i.

**4. The code does not handle the case where n is not a prime number**

The code should handle the case where n is not a prime number. This can be done by using the Chinese remainder theorem.

**5. The code does not handle the case where m is not even**

The code should handle the case where m is not even. This can be done by adding 1 to m before computing the minimum amount of ink.

**6. The code is not efficient**

The code can be made more efficient by using a more efficient algorithm to compute the minimum amount of ink. One possible algorithm is to use dynamic programming.

CODEFORCES 375_D. Tree and Queries

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. The tree traversal algorithm should visit each vertex of the tree exactly once, and the order in which the vertices are visited should not matter.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the query processing algorithm.** The query processing algorithm should correctly count the number of vertices in the subtree of the given vertex that have the given color.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The input to this problem may contain edge cases, such as a tree with no vertices or a tree with only one vertex. The developer's solution must be able to handle these edge cases correctly.
4. **Memory leaks.** The developer's solution must not leak memory. This is especially important for large trees, which can quickly exhaust the memory of the system.
5. **Time complexity.** The developer's solution must have a time complexity that is linear in the size of the input. This is because the input to this problem is relatively small, and a solution with a quadratic or worse time complexity would not be able to solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time.

CODEFORCES 398_A. Cards

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains two integers, so you should use `int` to store them. However, if you use `long` or `long long` instead, you may get a compilation error or a runtime error.

**2. Not initializing the variables**

Before using a variable, you should initialize it with a value. Otherwise, the variable may contain garbage values, which may lead to incorrect results.

**3. Using the wrong operators**

The problem statement says that the score of a block of contiguous "o"s with length `x` is `x^2`, and the score of a block of contiguous "x"s with length `y` is `-y^2`. So, if you use the wrong operators, you may get incorrect results.

**4. Not considering all the possible cases**

The problem statement says that "ainta has to arrange all his cards". So, you should make sure that your solution arranges all the cards.

**5. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The problem statement says that "ainta likes big numbers", so you should try to maximize the score. However, if you use an incorrect algorithm, you may not get the maximum score.

**6. Not handling errors correctly**

The problem statement does not mention any errors. However, you should still handle errors correctly. For example, if the input is invalid, you should print an error message and exit the program.

Title:
CODEFORCES 515_A. Drazil and Date

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be a line with three integers separated by spaces. If the input is not in the correct format, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be either "Yes" or "No". If the output is not in the correct format, the program will get a runtime error.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The program needs to calculate the distance between (0, 0) and (a, b) and compare it to s. If the distance is greater than s, the program should output "No". Otherwise, it should output "Yes".
4. **Off-by-one errors**. When calculating the distance between two points, it is important to make sure that you are not off by one. For example, if the two points are (0, 0) and (1, 0), the distance between them is 1, not 2.
5. **Arithmetic overflow**. When calculating the distance between two points, it is important to make sure that you do not overflow the integer data type. For example, if the two points are (1000000000, 1000000000) and (1000000001, 1000000001), the distance between them is 2, not 2000000002.
6. **Other bugs**. There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:
    * Using the wrong data type for a variable
    * Making a logical error in the code
    * Forgetting to check for special cases
    * Using an incorrect algorithm
    * Misunderstanding the problem statement

CODEFORCES 569_C. Primes or Palindromes?

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be two positive integers p, q, the numerator and denominator of the fraction that is the value of A. If the input is not in the correct format, the program should raise an error.
2. **Incorrect value of A**. The value of A should be a positive fraction. If the value of A is not a positive fraction, the program should raise an error.
3. **Incorrect value of n**. The value of n should be a positive integer. If the value of n is not a positive integer, the program should raise an error.
4. **Arithmetic error**. The program may encounter arithmetic errors when computing the values of π(n) and rub(n). These errors can be avoided by using the correct data types and by performing the calculations carefully.
5. **Off-by-one error**. The program may make an off-by-one error when computing the value of n. This can be avoided by carefully checking the boundary conditions.
6. **Infinite loop**. The program may enter an infinite loop if it does not properly handle the case where π(n) > A·rub(n). This can be avoided by checking the condition π(n) > A·rub(n) before entering the loop.
7. **Incorrect output**. The program may output the wrong answer if it does not properly handle the cases where π(n) > A·rub(n) or n does not exist. This can be avoided by carefully checking the conditions and by outputting the correct answer.

CODEFORCES 611_H. New Year and Forgotten Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format should be a single integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200 000) on the first line, followed by `n - 1` lines, each containing two space-separated non-empty strings, both consisting of questions marks only. No string should have more characters than the number of digits in `n`.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single line with `-1` (without the quotes) if there is no tree matching Limak's records, or `n - 1` lines, each with two space-separated integers – indices of vertices connected by an edge. You can print edges in any order.
3. **Incorrect tree construction.** The tree must be a connected undirected graph with `n - 1` edges, where `n` denotes the number of vertices. Vertices are numbered 1 through `n`.
4. **Limak's mistake.** It is possible that Limak made a mistake and there is no suitable tree. In this case, you should print `-1` (without the quotes).

CODEFORCES 631_E. Product Sum

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specified in the problem statement is n followed by n integers. However, a developer may accidentally read the input incorrectly, for example, by reading n as a single integer and then the n integers as a single string. This would result in a ValueError being raised.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specified in the problem statement is a single integer. However, a developer may accidentally print multiple integers, or a string, or nothing at all. This would result in a Wrong Answer verdict.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the characteristic.** The characteristic is defined as the sum of the products of the values ai by i. However, a developer may accidentally calculate the sum of the values ai or the sum of the products of the values ai by i-1. This would result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect choice of the element to move.** The goal is to get the array with the maximum possible value of characteristic. However, a developer may accidentally choose an element that does not lead to the maximum value of characteristic. This would result in an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect implementation of the move operation.** The move operation is allowed to move the element to any position in the array. However, a developer may accidentally move the element to a position that is not allowed. This would result in an incorrect answer.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to carefully implement the calculation of the characteristic and the choice of the element to move. Finally, it is important to carefully implement the move operation.

CODEFORCES 683_G. The Fraction

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input may not be in the correct format, e.g., it may contain non-numeric characters or the period may be missing.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output must be in the format `p / q`, where `p` and `q` are integers and `q` is not equal to 0.
3. **Arithmetic errors**. The developer may make mistakes when performing arithmetic operations, e.g., when computing the GCD of two integers.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer may forget to add or subtract 1 when computing the period of the fraction.
5. **Infinite loops**. The developer may write an infinite loop, e.g., when trying to compute the GCD of two numbers that are not coprime.
6. **Memory errors**. The developer may run out of memory, e.g., when trying to store a large number of digits in the period of the fraction.
7. **Time errors**. The developer's solution may run too slowly, e.g., when using a brute-force algorithm to compute the GCD of two numbers.
8. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem, e.g., an algorithm that does not always produce the correct answer.

CODEFORCES 707_A. Brain's Photos

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific. It expects two integers on the first line, followed by n lines of m space-separated characters. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output for this problem should be a single line containing either "#Black&White" or "#Color". If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will likely receive a incorrect verdict.
3. **Incorrect use of variables.** The program should use variables in a consistent and logical way. For example, the variable `n` should be used to store the number of rows in the photo, and the variable `m` should be used to store the number of columns in the photo. If the variables are used incorrectly, the program will likely produce incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The program should use correct logic to determine whether the photo is black-and-white or colored. For example, the program should check if any of the pixels in the photo are cyan, magenta, or yellow. If any of these colors are present, the photo should be considered colored. If no colors are present, the photo should be considered black-and-white. If the logic is incorrect, the program will likely produce incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The program should handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input format is incorrect, the program should print an error message and exit. If the program encounters a runtime error, it should also print an error message and exit. If errors are not handled correctly, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 72_B. INI-file

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not very clear.** The problem statement does not explicitly state that the first line of input contains the number of lines in the file. This could lead to confusion for developers who are not familiar with the INI file format.
2. **The problem statement does not specify how to handle comments.** The problem statement states that comment lines should be ignored, but it does not specify how to do this. This could lead to developers implementing different solutions that produce different results.
3. **The problem statement does not specify how to handle duplicate key-value pairs.** The problem statement states that only one key-value pair with the same key should be printed, but it does not specify how to handle duplicate key-value pairs. This could lead to developers implementing different solutions that produce different results.
4. **The problem statement does not specify how to handle empty sections.** The problem statement states that all sections should be printed in alphabetical order, but it does not specify what to do if a section does not contain any key-value pairs. This could lead to developers implementing different solutions that produce different results.
5. **The problem statement does not specify how to handle whitespace.** The problem statement states that all redundant spaces should be removed, but it does not specify how to do this. This could lead to developers implementing different solutions that produce different results.

Here are some possible solutions to these problems:

1. **The input format could be made more clear by explicitly stating that the first line of input contains the number of lines in the file.** This would help to prevent confusion for developers who are not familiar with the INI file format.
2. **The problem statement could be clarified by specifying how to handle comments.** The problem statement could state that comment lines should be ignored by simply skipping over them.
3. **The problem statement could be clarified by specifying how to handle duplicate key-value pairs.** The problem statement could state that only the first key-value pair with a given key should be printed.
4. **The problem statement could be clarified by specifying how to handle empty sections.** The problem statement could state that empty sections should not be printed.
5. **The problem statement could be clarified by specifying how to handle whitespace.** The problem statement could state that all leading and trailing whitespace should be removed.

CODEFORCES 773_C. Prairie Partition

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect prairie partition**

A prairie partition is a representation of a positive integer as a sum of consecutive powers of 2. For example, 12 can be represented as 1 + 2 + 4 + 5, which is a valid prairie partition. However, 12 cannot be represented as 1 + 2 + 4 + 4, because 4 is not a consecutive power of 2. If a developer incorrectly uses an invalid prairie partition, the resulting sequence of numbers will not be in non-decreasing order.

**2. Incorrect sorting**

The resulting sequence of numbers must be in non-decreasing order. If a developer does not sort the sequence correctly, the output will be incorrect.

**3. Missing a possible solution**

The output should list all possible values of m such that there exists a sequence of positive integers of length m such that if you replace every element with the summands in its prairie partition and arrange the resulting numbers in non-decreasing order, you will get the sequence given in the input. If there are multiple possible solutions, all of them should be listed. A developer may miss a possible solution if they do not consider all possible cases.

**4. Incorrect implementation of the prairie partition algorithm**

The prairie partition algorithm is a recursive algorithm that can be used to find the prairie partition of a positive integer. If a developer incorrectly implements the algorithm, the resulting sequence of numbers will not be a valid prairie partition.

**5. Incorrect input validation**

The input must be a valid sequence of positive integers. If a developer does not validate the input correctly, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

**6. Incorrect output formatting**

The output must be in the format specified in the problem statement. If a developer does not format the output correctly, the submission will be incorrect.
Test inputs:
1. Incorrect prairie partition

```
n = 5
arr = [1, 2, 4, 4, 4]
```

This input will cause the program to output -1, because the prairie partition of 4 is 1 + 2 + 1, which is not a valid prairie partition.

2. Incorrect sorting

```
n = 5
arr = [1, 2, 4, 4, 4]
```

This input will cause the program to output 1, because the prairie partition of 4 is 1 + 2 + 1, which is not a valid prairie partition. However, the resulting sequence of numbers will be in non-decreasing order, so the program will output 1.

3. Missing a possible solution

```
n = 6
arr = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]
```

This input will cause the program to output 2, because there is only one possible solution: [4, 5]. However, the program should also output 3, because there is also a possible solution: [3, 3, 3].

4. Incorrect implementation of the prairie partition algorithm

```
n = 5
arr = [1, 2, 4, 4, 4]
```

This input will cause the program to output 1, because the prairie partition of 4 is 1 + 2 + 1, which is not a valid prairie partition. However, the program will still output 1, because the algorithm will incorrectly return the prairie partition of 4 as 1 + 2 + 1.

5. Incorrect input validation

```
n = -1
arr = []
```

This input will cause the program to crash, because the input is not a valid sequence of positive integers.

6. Incorrect output formatting

```
n = 5
arr = [1, 2, 4, 4, 4]
```

This input will cause the program to output 1, because the prairie partition of 4 is 1 + 2 + 1, which is not a valid prairie partition. However, the program will output 1, because the output will be formatted incorrectly.

Here are some additional program inputs that will validate whether an implementation meets the other requirements of the problem spec:

* An input with a single number
* An input with a negative number
* An input with a number that is not a positive integer
* An input with a number that is too large
* An input with a sequence of numbers that is not in non-decreasing order
* An input with a sequence of numbers that contains duplicates

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may contain a non-integer number, a string, or a value that is out of range.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm that the developer uses to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not account for all of the constraints in the problem statement, or it may not be efficient enough to solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time.
4. **Incorrect data structures**. The developer may use data structures that are not appropriate for the problem. For example, the developer may use a linked list to store the data, when a hash table would be more efficient.
5. **Incorrect error handling**. The developer may not handle errors correctly. For example, the developer may not check for errors when reading the input data, or the developer may not handle exceptions that are thrown by the code.
6. **Incorrect testing**. The developer may not test the code thoroughly enough. For example, the developer may only test the code on a small number of inputs, or the developer may not test the code on inputs that are intentionally designed to cause errors.
7. **Incorrect documentation**. The developer may not provide adequate documentation for the code. For example, the developer may not include a README file, or the developer may not include comments in the code.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully read the problem statement and understand all of the constraints. Developers should also use appropriate data structures and algorithms to solve the problem. Developers should test the code thoroughly and provide adequate documentation.

CODEFORCES 88_B. Keyboard

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input format is incorrect, the program may not be able to parse the input correctly and may produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input may not be correctly specified, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input is a string but the program expects an integer, the program may not be able to process the input correctly and may produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, which can lead to errors in the output. For example, if the program does not correctly account for all of the possible cases, the output may be incorrect.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the program does not correctly account for the size of an array or other data structure. For example, if the program iterates over an array one element too many or one element too few, the output may be incorrect.
5. **Memory errors**. The program may run out of memory, which can lead to errors in the output. For example, if the program allocates too much memory, it may crash.
6. **Timeout errors**. The program may take too long to run, which can lead to errors in the output. For example, if the program is not efficient enough, it may not finish running before the time limit is reached.

CODEFORCES 912_E. Prime Gift

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n, the second line should list n distinct prime numbers p1, p2, ..., pn in ascending order, and the third line should give a single integer k. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect use of mathematical operators**. The problem requires the program to find the k-th smallest integer such that all its prime divisors are in the given set. To do this, the program must first find the list of all integers that have all their prime divisors in the given set. Then, the program must sort this list and find the k-th smallest element. If the program incorrectly uses mathematical operators, it may produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect use of data structures**. The problem requires the program to store the list of all integers that have all their prime divisors in the given set. To do this, the program must use a data structure that can store a large number of integers. If the program incorrectly uses a data structure, it may not be able to store all of the integers and will produce incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect algorithm**. The problem requires the program to find the k-th smallest integer such that all its prime divisors are in the given set. There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. If the program uses an incorrect algorithm, it may produce incorrect output.
5. **Incorrect implementation**. Even if the program uses the correct algorithm and data structures, it may still produce incorrect output if the implementation is incorrect. The program must be carefully implemented to ensure that it correctly performs all of the necessary operations.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements. It is also important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it produces the correct output for all possible inputs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 960_G. Bandit Blues

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer, which is the number of valid permutations modulo 998244353.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of valid permutations**. The number of valid permutations can be calculated in a number of ways. One way is to use the following formula:

```
P(N, A, B) = (N! / (A! * B!)) % 998244353
```

where N is the number of bags, A is the number of bags that are picked from the front, and B is the number of bags that are picked from the back.
4. **Modulo arithmetic errors**. When calculating the number of valid permutations modulo 998244353, it is important to perform all calculations modulo 998244353. This can be done by using the following formula:

```
(a * b) % 998244353 = ((a % 998244353) * (b % 998244353)) % 998244353
```

where a and b are integers.
5. **Off-by-one errors**. When calculating the number of valid permutations, it is important to make sure that you do not count any permutations twice. For example, if you are counting the number of permutations of the set {1, 2, 3}, you should not count the permutations {1, 2, 3} and {2, 1, 3} as two different permutations.
6. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These bugs can include:

* Using the wrong formula to calculate the number of valid permutations.
* Using the wrong modulo arithmetic operations.
* Counting some permutations twice.
* Making other logical errors.

CODEFORCES 988_D. Points and Powers of Two

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect sorting**

The input points are first sorted in ascending order. However, the distance between two points is not necessarily an integral power of two. For example, the distance between 3 and 5 is 2, which is not an integral power of two.

**2. Incorrect calculation of distance**

The distance between two points is calculated as |x_i - x_j|. However, this is not correct when one of the points is 0. For example, the distance between 0 and 5 is 5, which is not an integral power of two.

**3. Incorrect choice of subset**

The subset of points is chosen such that the distance between each pair of points is an integral power of two. However, this is not always possible. For example, if the input points are all equal, then there is no subset of points that satisfies the required condition.

**4. Incorrect output**

The output should be the maximum possible number of points in a subset that satisfies the conditions described above. However, the output may be less than the maximum possible number of points. For example, if the input points are all equal, then the output should be 1, but the output may be 0.

Title:
HACKEREARTH amazing-race-3

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is given in the form of integers, but the developer may accidentally store it as strings. This will lead to incorrect results.

**2. Off-by-one error**

The developer may accidentally calculate the distance between two points incorrectly, resulting in an off-by-one error. This will lead to incorrect results.

**3. Floating-point error**

The developer may accidentally round the distance between two points incorrectly, resulting in a floating-point error. This will lead to incorrect results.

**4. Undefined behavior**

The developer may accidentally access an array element that is out of bounds, resulting in undefined behavior. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

**5. Memory leak**

The developer may accidentally allocate memory that is not freed, resulting in a memory leak. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

**6. Race condition**

The developer may accidentally access a shared resource from multiple threads at the same time, resulting in a race condition. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.

**7. Deadlock**

The developer may accidentally create a situation where two threads are waiting for each other to finish, resulting in a deadlock. This can prevent the program from making any progress and eventually crashing.

Title:
HACKEREARTH candy-1

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data consists of integers. So we need to use the `int` data type to store the values. However, if we accidentally use the `float` data type, we may get incorrect results. For example, if we have an input value of `1000000000`, the `float` data type will store it as `1e+09`. This is not the same as the integer value of `1000000000`. So, we need to make sure that we use the correct data type to store the input values.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the cheapest product that Daenerys cannot buy. We can solve this problem using a binary search algorithm. However, if we use the wrong algorithm, we may not get the correct answer. For example, if we use a linear search algorithm, we will have to iterate through all the products in the market, which is inefficient.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The problem asks us to find the cheapest product that Daenerys cannot buy. So, we need to find the smallest product that is not divisible by any of the coins that Daenerys has. However, if we use incorrect logic, we may not get the correct answer. For example, if we only consider the coins that are smaller than the product, we may miss some coins that are larger than the product.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement does not specify any edge cases. So, we need to make sure that we handle all the possible edge cases. For example, if the input data is empty, we need to return `-1`.

**5. Insufficient testing**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed. You can test your code by using different input data sets. You can also use a debugger to help you find bugs in your code.

Title:
HACKEREARTH defuse-the-bomb-3

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly identifying the number of digits in B.** The number of digits in B is not always equal to the length of the string representation of B. For example, the number 100 has two digits, but its string representation is only three characters long.
2. **Using the wrong modulus operator.** The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. This means that if you divide a number by 10 and then take the modulus, you will get the last digit of the number. However, if you divide a number by 10 and then multiply it by another number, you will not get the last digit of the product.
3. **Using the wrong order of operations.** When multiplying numbers, it is important to remember that multiplication is performed before addition. This means that if you have an expression like `a * b + c`, the value of `a * b` will be calculated first, and then the result will be added to `c`.
4. **Using the wrong type of variable.** When working with numbers, it is important to use the correct type of variable. For example, if you are working with integers, you should use the `int` type, and if you are working with floating-point numbers, you should use the `float` type.
5. **Using an incorrect loop condition.** When looping through a sequence of numbers, it is important to use the correct loop condition. For example, if you are looping through the numbers from 1 to 10, you should use the condition `i < 11`.
6. **Using an incorrect index.** When accessing elements of an array or list, it is important to use the correct index. For example, if you are trying to access the first element of an array, you should use the index `0`.
7. **Not handling errors correctly.** When working with code, it is important to handle errors correctly. This means that you should check for errors and take appropriate action if an error occurs. For example, if you try to divide a number by zero, you should throw an exception.

HACKEREARTH game-of-thrones

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not always followed correctly. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. This can cause the program to crash or give incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect variable type**. The variables used in the program must be of the correct type. For example, if a variable is declared as an integer, it cannot be used to store a string. This can cause the program to crash or give incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be correct. For example, the program must check if the input is valid before processing it. If the input is invalid, the program must exit with an error message.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output of the program must be in the correct format. For example, the output must be a single number, or a list of numbers. If the output is not in the correct format, the program will not be accepted.
5. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can cause the program to skip over or repeat a line of code, which can lead to incorrect results.
6. **Indexing errors**. Indexing errors occur when a programmer accesses an element of an array or list that is out of bounds. This can cause the program to crash or give incorrect results.
7. **Null pointer errors**. Null pointer errors occur when a programmer tries to access a memory address that does not contain a valid value. This can cause the program to crash or give incorrect results.
8. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when a programmer allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
9. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to give incorrect results or crash.
10. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely.

HACKEREARTH kth-shortest-path

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not very clear. It is not clear whether the first line of each test case should contain two space-separated integers or three space-separated integers. It is also not clear whether the values in the matrix should be space-separated or comma-separated. This can lead to errors in parsing the input.
2. **Incorrect handling of obstacles**. The problem states that obstacles are marked by "##", but it does not specify how to handle obstacles when computing the shortest path. This can lead to errors in the output.
3. **Incorrect handling of queries**. The problem states that the output for a query should be the kth shortest path, but it does not specify what to do if k exceeds the total number of paths to the given cell. This can lead to errors in the output.
4. **Incorrect use of data structures**. The problem requires computing the shortest path from the top-left corner to a given cell. A naive approach would be to use a breadth-first search or a depth-first search. However, these algorithms can be inefficient for large matrices. A more efficient approach would be to use a dynamic programming algorithm.
5. **Incorrect implementation of the dynamic programming algorithm**. The dynamic programming algorithm for computing the shortest path from the top-left corner to a given cell is relatively straightforward. However, there are a few common errors that can be made when implementing the algorithm. For example, it is important to correctly initialize the DP table and to correctly update the DP table when considering each possible move.
6. **Incorrect handling of boundary conditions**. The dynamic programming algorithm for computing the shortest path from the top-left corner to a given cell must correctly handle the boundary conditions. For example, the algorithm must correctly handle the case where the given cell is an obstacle.
7. **Incorrect output format**. The problem states that the output for a query should be the kth shortest path. However, it does not specify how to represent the shortest path. This can lead to errors in the output. For example, the output could be a list of the nodes in the shortest path, or it could be the sum of the costs of the nodes in the shortest path.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable names.** The variable `N` is used to represent the number of students in the class, but it is also used to represent the roll number of the student who wins the game. This could lead to confusion.
2. **Incorrect use of the `in` operator.** The `in` operator is used to check if a value is contained in a sequence. In this problem, the `in` operator is used to check if a letter is contained in a string. This is incorrect because the `in` operator can only be used to check if a value is contained in a sequence of the same type.
3. **Incorrect use of the `ord()` function.** The `ord()` function is used to convert a character to its ASCII code. In this problem, the `ord()` function is used to convert a string to its ASCII code. This is incorrect because the `ord()` function can only be used to convert a single character to its ASCII code.
4. **Incorrect use of the `chr()` function.** The `chr()` function is used to convert an ASCII code to a character. In this problem, the `chr()` function is used to convert a string to a character. This is incorrect because the `chr()` function can only be used to convert a single ASCII code to a character.
5. **Incorrect use of the `range()` function.** The `range()` function is used to generate a sequence of numbers. In this problem, the `range()` function is used to generate a sequence of characters. This is incorrect because the `range()` function can only be used to generate a sequence of numbers.
6. **Incorrect use of the `while` loop.** The `while` loop is used to iterate over a sequence of values. In this problem, the `while` loop is used to iterate over a string. This is incorrect because the `while` loop can only be used to iterate over a sequence of numbers.
7. **Incorrect use of the `if` statement.** The `if` statement is used to check if a condition is true. In this problem, the `if` statement is used to check if a value is equal to a string. This is incorrect because the `if` statement can only be used to check if a value is equal to a number.
8. **Incorrect use of the `else` statement.** The `else` statement is used to execute code if a condition is not true. In this problem, the `else` statement is used to execute code if a value is not equal to a string. This is incorrect because the `else` statement can only be used to execute code if a value is not equal to a number.
9. **Incorrect use of the `break` statement.** The `break` statement is used to break out of a loop. In this problem, the `break` statement is used to break out of a function. This is incorrect because the `break` statement can only be used to break out of a loop.
10. **Incorrect use of the `return` statement.** The `return` statement is used to return a value from a function. In this problem, the `return` statement is used to return a string. This is incorrect because the `return` statement can only be used to return a value.

Title:
HACKEREARTH roy-and-counting-sorted-substrings-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of substring function**. The substring function in Python starts at the specified index and goes to the end of the string. For example, the substring of the string "abc" starting at index 1 is "bc". If you want to get the substring from index 1 to index 3, you need to use the following syntax: ```
substring = string[1:4]
```

2. **Using the wrong data type**. When counting the number of sorted substrings, you need to use a data type that can store large numbers. The default data type in Python is `int`, which can only store numbers up to 2^31-1. If you have a string with a length of more than 2^31-1 characters, you will need to use a data type such as `long` or `numpy.int64`.

3. **Off-by-one errors**. When counting the number of sorted substrings, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, if you are counting the number of sorted substrings of length 3 in the string "abc", you might accidentally count the substring "abc" twice. To avoid this error, you need to be careful about the bounds of your loop.

4. **Incorrect use of the break statement**. The break statement can be used to terminate a loop early. However, it is important to use the break statement correctly. For example, the following code will not work correctly:
```
for i in range(len(string)):
    if string[i] > string[i+1]:
        break
    count += 1
```
This code will only count the number of sorted substrings up to the first character that is not sorted. To correctly count the number of sorted substrings, you need to use the following code:
```
count = 0
for i in range(len(string)):
    if string[i] > string[i+1]:
        continue
    count += 1
```

5. **Using global variables**. Global variables are variables that are accessible from anywhere in your program. This can be dangerous because it can make it difficult to track down bugs. Whenever possible, you should avoid using global variables.

6. **Not using comments**. Comments are used to explain your code. They can be very helpful for other developers who are trying to understand your code. It is important to use comments liberally so that your code is easy to understand.

Title:
HACKEREARTH string-query-22

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the frequency array.**

The frequency array stores the number of times each character appears in the string. If you use an integer array, you will not be able to store frequencies greater than 255. You should use a long array instead.

**2. Not handling the case where the character does not appear in the string.**

In the problem statement, it is stated that "the letter to be deleted always exists and the string is never empty". However, it is possible for a query to ask you to delete a character that does not appear in the string. In this case, you should simply do nothing.

**3. Using the wrong index when deleting a character.**

When you delete a character from the string, you need to update the frequencies of all the characters that come after it. If you use the wrong index, you will not update the frequencies correctly and your answer will be incorrect.

**4. Not handling the case where the character is deleted from the beginning of the string.**

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**

The input format is given as follows:

```
N L
```

where `N` is the number of apples and `L` is the flavor of the first apple. However, the input format in the problem statement is incorrect. It should be:

```
N L + 1
```

where `N` is the number of apples and `L + 1` is the flavor of the first apple.

**2. The output format is not correct**

The output format is given as follows:

```
The flavor of the apple pie made of the remaining N-1 apples when you optimally choose the apple to eat.
```

However, the output format in the problem statement is incorrect. It should be:

```
The flavor of the apple pie made of all the N apples.
```

**3. The problem is not well-defined**

The problem is not well-defined because it does not specify what happens if the apple you eat is the last apple. In this case, the flavor of the apple pie made of the remaining N-1 apples would be zero.

**4. The problem is too easy**

The problem is too easy because the optimal solution is always to eat the apple with the lowest flavor.

**5. The problem is too hard**

The problem is too hard because there is no known polynomial-time algorithm to solve it.

Title:
ATCODER p03915 CODE FESTIVAL 2016 Final - Zigzag MST

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data structure**

The input format of this problem is a bit tricky. It is easy to make a mistake and use the wrong data structure to store the edges. For example, you might try to use a list of tuples to store the edges, but this will not work because the edges will not be sorted by their weights.

The correct way to store the edges is to use a heap. A heap is a data structure that can be used to efficiently find the smallest element in a set of elements. In this problem, we can use a heap to store the edges that are currently in the minimum spanning tree. This will allow us to quickly find the edge with the smallest weight that is not currently in the minimum spanning tree.

**2. Not considering all of the edges**

Another common mistake is to only consider the edges that are added in the current query. In this problem, we need to consider all of the edges that have been added in all of the queries. This means that we need to keep track of all of the edges that have been added, and we need to update our minimum spanning tree whenever a new edge is added.

**3. Using the wrong algorithm**

The correct algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree is Kruskal's algorithm. Kruskal's algorithm works by repeatedly adding the edge with the smallest weight that does not create a cycle in the graph. This process will eventually find a minimum spanning tree for the graph.

**4. Not handling duplicate edges correctly**

It is possible that the same edge will be added multiple times in the input. In this case, we need to handle the duplicate edges correctly. We can do this by simply ignoring the duplicate edges. This is because the weight of a duplicate edge will not change the weight of the minimum spanning tree.

**5. Not handling negative weights correctly**

The weights of the edges in this problem can be negative. In this case, we need to handle the negative weights correctly. We can do this by using the following algorithm:

1. Sort the edges by their weights.
2. Add the edges to the minimum spanning tree in order of increasing weight.
3. If an edge creates a cycle in the minimum spanning tree, then remove the edge from the minimum spanning tree.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no more edges can be added to the minimum spanning tree.

This algorithm will find a minimum spanning tree for the graph, even if the weights of the edges are negative.

Title:
AIZU p00017 Caesar Cipher

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect decoding algorithm**. The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher, but it is not as secure as more modern ciphers. If the developer does not implement the algorithm correctly, the decoded text may not be correct.
2. **Incorrect input validation**. The input to the program should be a string of lowercase letters, periods, spaces, and end-of-lines. If the developer does not validate the input correctly, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect output formatting**. The output of the program should be a single line of text. If the developer does not format the output correctly, it may be difficult to read and understand.
4. **Incorrect handling of errors**. The program should handle errors gracefully. If the program encounters an error, it should print an error message and exit.
5. **Inefficient implementation**. The program can be implemented in a more efficient way. For example, the program can use a lookup table to map encrypted letters to their decoded equivalents.
6. **Unnecessary complexity**. The program can be simplified by removing unnecessary features. For example, the program does not need to support multiple datasets.
7. **Poor documentation**. The program should be well-documented so that other developers can understand how it works.
8. **Inconsistent coding style**. The program should use a consistent coding style so that it is easy to read and maintain.
9. **Missing unit tests**. The program should have unit tests to ensure that it is working correctly.
10. **Missing integration tests**. The program should have integration tests to ensure that it is working correctly with other components.

AIZU p00662 The Great Summer Contest

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The problem states that the input values are integers, but the code below incorrectly treats them as strings. This can lead to errors when the input values contain non-numeric characters.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The code below incorrectly calculates the number of contests that can be held by adding the number of problems of each type together. This will result in an incorrect answer if there are not enough problems of each type to hold a contest.
3. **Infinite loop**. The code below contains an infinite loop that will never terminate if the input values are all zero. This can be fixed by adding a condition to the loop that checks if the input values are all zero.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The code below incorrectly outputs the number of contests as a string instead of an integer. This can be fixed by changing the type of the output variable to an integer.

Here is a corrected version of the code that solves the problem without any of the above errors:

AIZU p01069 Sum of Sequences

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is given as integers, but the developer may mistakenly treat it as strings. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer may forget to take into account the fact that the indices of the elements in the sequences start from 0. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the absolute value**. The developer may forget to take the absolute value of the difference between the two sums. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect counting of the number of combinations**. The developer may not correctly account for the fact that the elements in the sequences can be repeated. This can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect output format**. The developer may not correctly format the output, which can make it difficult to read and understand.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that they understand all of the constraints. They should also carefully test their code to make sure that it produces the correct results.

Title:
AIZU p01506 Digit

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong base for the calculation**

The problem states that we should find the sum of the digits in base `l`. However, if we accidentally use the wrong base, the results will be incorrect.

**2. Using the wrong modulo**

The problem states that we should print the answer modulo `m`. However, if we accidentally print the answer without modulo, the results will be incorrect.

**3. Not handling the special case of `N == 0` correctly**

The problem states that we should find the minimum `a` such that `L(a) = N`. However, if `N == 0`, then `L(a) = 0` for all `a`. In this case, we should simply print `0`.

**4. Not handling the special case of `l == 2` correctly**

The problem states that we should find the minimum `a` such that `L(a) = N`. However, if `l == 2`, then `L(a) = 1` for all `a`. In this case, we should simply print `1`.

Title:
AIZU p01956 Window

Pain points:
**1. Mismatch between input and output format**

The input format is "$N$ $H$ $W$
$x_1$ ... $x_N$", but the output format is "Print the area where the window is open after the instructions in one line". The developer may forget to convert the output to the correct format.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the area of the open window**

The developer may incorrectly calculate the area of the open window. For example, the developer may forget to take into account the width of the windowpanes.

**3. Incorrect handling of negative values**

The input may contain negative values. The developer may incorrectly handle negative values, which may lead to incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

The input may contain edge cases, such as $N = 1$ or $W = 0$. The developer may incorrectly handle edge cases, which may lead to incorrect results.

Title:
AIZU p02243 Single Source Shortest Path II

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm**

Dijkstra's algorithm is a well-known algorithm for finding the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. However, there are a few common mistakes that developers make when implementing Dijkstra's algorithm.

* **Using a priority queue with the wrong ordering**. Dijkstra's algorithm uses a priority queue to keep track of the vertices that have not yet been visited and their estimated distances from the source vertex. The priority queue should be ordered by the estimated distances, with the vertex with the smallest estimated distance being at the top of the queue. If the priority queue is not ordered correctly, then Dijkstra's algorithm will not find the shortest paths.
* **Not updating the estimated distances**. As Dijkstra's algorithm iterates through the vertices, it updates the estimated distances of the vertices that are adjacent to the current vertex. If the estimated distance of a vertex is updated, then the vertex should be reinserted into the priority queue. If the vertex is not reinserted into the priority queue, then Dijkstra's algorithm will not find the shortest paths.
* **Terminating the algorithm too early**. Dijkstra's algorithm terminates when the priority queue is empty. However, if there are still vertices that have not been visited, then Dijkstra's algorithm has not found all of the shortest paths. The algorithm should be terminated only after all of the vertices have been visited.

**2. Using an incorrect data structure for the graph**

Dijkstra's algorithm requires a data structure to represent the graph. The most common data structure for representing a graph is an adjacency list. An adjacency list stores the vertices that are adjacent to each vertex. However, there are other data structures that can be used to represent a graph, such as an adjacency matrix. If the wrong data structure is used, then Dijkstra's algorithm will not work correctly.

**3. Using incorrect data types**

Dijkstra's algorithm requires the use of certain data types. For example, the estimated distances of the vertices must be represented using a data type that can store negative numbers. If the wrong data types are used, then Dijkstra's algorithm will not work correctly.

**4. Using incorrect values**

Dijkstra's algorithm requires the use of certain values. For example, the weight of each edge must be a non-negative number. If the wrong values are used, then Dijkstra's algorithm will not work correctly.

**5. Not handling errors correctly**

Dijkstra's algorithm can throw errors if the graph is not represented correctly or if the data types or values are incorrect. It is important to handle these errors correctly so that the algorithm does not crash.

By avoiding these common mistakes, developers can implement Dijkstra's algorithm correctly and find the shortest paths in a weighted graph.

Title:
AIZU p02389 Rectangle

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be two integers separated by a single space. If the input format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of area and perimeter**. The area of a rectangle is equal to its length multiplied by its breadth. The perimeter of a rectangle is equal to twice its length plus twice its breadth. The program must correctly calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be two integers separated by a single space. The program must correctly format the output.
4. **Other bugs**. There may be other bugs in the program that are not listed here. The developer should carefully test the program to identify and fix any bugs.
