Title:
CODECHEF cstrike3

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type for the input string.** The input string is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters. This means that it can contain any character from 'a' to 'z'. If we use an incorrect data type for the input string, such as an integer or a floating-point number, then we will not be able to correctly parse the input and our program will not work correctly.
2. **Using an incorrect algorithm to determine the number of distinct characters in the input string.** The number of distinct characters in a string can be determined using the following algorithm:

```
1. Create a set of all the characters in the string.
2. Count the number of elements in the set.
```

This algorithm will correctly determine the number of distinct characters in the input string, regardless of the order of the characters in the string.
3. **Using an incorrect comparison operator to compare the number of distinct characters in the input string to the number 1.** The number of distinct characters in a string can be either odd or even. To correctly determine whether the number of distinct characters in the input string is odd or even, we need to use the following comparison operator:

```
==
```

This operator will return `True` if the two operands are equal and `False` otherwise.
4. **Outputting the wrong answer.** The output of the program should be either `"Terrorist"` or `"Counter Terrorist"`. If the program outputs the wrong answer, then it is not working correctly.
5. **Not handling invalid input correctly.** The input string may be invalid for a number of reasons. For example, it may be empty, it may contain characters that are not lowercase English letters, or it may contain more than one space character. If the input string is invalid, then the program should handle it gracefully and output an appropriate error message.

CODECHEF

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one errors**. When comparing two strings, it is important to make sure that you are comparing the same number of characters. For example, if you are comparing the strings "CODECHEF" and "DRINKEATCODE", you would need to compare the first 6 characters of each string. If you compare the first 5 characters, you would miss the "E" in "DRINKEATCODE".
2. **Incorrect case sensitivity**. When comparing strings, it is important to make sure that you are comparing the strings in the same case. For example, if you are comparing the strings "CODECHEF" and "drInkeatcode", you would need to make sure that you are comparing the strings in lowercase. If you compare the strings in uppercase, you would miss the "e" in "drInkeatcode".
3. **Incorrect character encoding**. When comparing strings, it is important to make sure that the strings are encoded in the same way. For example, if you are comparing the strings "CODECHEF" and "DRINKEATCODE", you would need to make sure that the strings are both encoded in UTF-8. If one of the strings is encoded in a different character encoding, you would get unexpected results.
4. **Incorrect string comparison algorithm**. There are many different algorithms that can be used to compare strings. The best algorithm to use depends on the specific application. For example, if you are comparing strings that are very long, you might want to use a different algorithm than if you are comparing strings that are very short.
5. **Incorrect handling of invalid strings**. When comparing strings, it is important to handle invalid strings correctly. For example, if you are comparing a string that contains a null character, you would need to handle the null character correctly. If you ignore the null character, you might get unexpected results.

Pain points:
Example case 2. The only possible subarray is [-1]. So the maximal sum is -1. 1. **Incorrectly using the prefix sum array.** The prefix sum array is a useful tool for solving problems on subarray sums. However, it is important to use it correctly. In particular, the prefix sum array should be initialized to 0, not to the first element of the input array.
2. **Not considering the case where all elements of the array are negative.** In this case, the maximum possible subarray sum is 0, which can be achieved by removing all elements of the array.
3. **Not handling the case where the input array is empty.** In this case, the maximum possible subarray sum is 0.
4. **Not handling the case where the input array contains only one element.** In this case, the maximum possible subarray sum is equal to the value of the element.

Title:
CODECHEF repub

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type to store the frequency of each letter.**

The problem statement states that we need to count the frequency of each letter in the speech. We can do this by using a dictionary, where the keys are the letters and the values are the frequencies. However, if we use a `int` type for the values, we may encounter a bug if there are two letters with the same frequency. In this case, the output will be the first letter that was encountered, even if the second letter has a higher ASCII value.

To avoid this bug, we should use a `dict` type for the values, so that we can store the letters in sorted order. This will ensure that the letter with the highest ASCII value is always printed first.

**2. Not considering upper case letters as lower case for counting.**

The problem statement states that we should consider upper case letters as lower case for counting. This means that we need to convert all of the letters in the speech to lowercase before counting them. If we don't do this, we may miss some letters that are repeated in the speech.

To avoid this bug, we should use the `str.lower()` method to convert all of the letters in the speech to lowercase.

**3. Using the wrong algorithm to find the letter with the highest frequency.**

The problem statement states that we need to find the letter with the highest frequency in the speech. We can do this by using a simple algorithm that iterates through the dictionary of frequencies and returns the key with the highest value.

However, this algorithm is not very efficient, especially if the speech is long. A more efficient algorithm would be to use a heap data structure. This would allow us to find the letter with the highest frequency in O(log n) time, where n is the number of letters in the speech.

**4. Not handling invalid input correctly.**

The problem statement does not specify what should happen if the input is invalid. For example, what if the input is a string that contains non-alphabetic characters? In this case, we should handle the invalid input gracefully and print an appropriate error message.

To avoid this bug, we should check the input to make sure that it is a valid string of alphabetic characters. If the input is not valid, we should print an error message and exit the program.

CODEFORCES 1017_D. The Wu

Pain points:
**Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs That a Developer May Encounter When Solving This Problem**

1. **Incorrectly calculating the "Wu" value of a pair of strings.** This is a common mistake that can be made when the strings are not of equal length. To avoid this, it is important to make sure that the strings are of the same length before calculating the "Wu" value.
2. **Incorrectly counting the number of strings in the multiset that satisfy the given condition.** This is another common mistake that can be made when the strings are not of equal length. To avoid this, it is important to make sure that the strings are of the same length before counting the number of strings that satisfy the condition.
3. **Not handling the case where the given k value is greater than the maximum possible "Wu" value of a pair of strings.** This is a rare case, but it is important to handle it correctly. To do this, it is necessary to return 0 as the answer.
4. **Not handling the case where the given k value is negative.** This is a rare case, but it is important to handle it correctly. To do this, it is necessary to return -1 as the answer.
5. **Not handling the case where the given t string is not of the same length as the strings in the multiset.** This is a rare case, but it is important to handle it correctly. To do this, it is necessary to return 0 as the answer.

**Additional Tips for Solving This Problem**

1. It is helpful to use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. This will allow you to efficiently calculate the "Wu" value of a pair of strings and count the number of strings in the multiset that satisfy the given condition.
2. It is also helpful to use a bitmask to represent the strings in the multiset. This will allow you to quickly check whether a given string is in the multiset.
3. Finally, it is important to be careful when handling the special cases that are described above. These cases can be easily missed if you are not careful.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1132_F. Clear the String

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input specifies that the length of the string `s` is at most 500. However, if we declare `s` as a string, it will take up a lot of memory. A better solution is to declare `s` as a character array of size `n`.

**2. Not handling the case where `s` is empty**

The problem statement does not explicitly state that `s` cannot be empty. However, if we try to delete an empty string, we will get a runtime error. A better solution is to check if `s` is empty before trying to delete it.

**3. Not handling the case where `s` contains only one character**

The problem statement does not explicitly state that `s` cannot contain only one character. However, if we try to delete a string with only one character, we will get a runtime error. A better solution is to check if `s` contains only one character before trying to delete it.

**4. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a simple greedy algorithm. We start by iterating over the string `s` from left to right. At each step, we delete the longest substring of `s` that consists of all the same characters. We repeat this process until `s` is empty.

**5. Not handling the corner cases**

There are a few corner cases that we need to handle when solving this problem. For example, we need to handle the case where `s` is empty, the case where `s` contains only one character, and the case where `s` contains a repeated substring.

**6. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it to Codeforces. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed.

If you make a mistake in the input format, the checker will not be able to understand your input and will give you an error.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is also very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when writing it. For example, you might forget to put a space between two numbers, or you might put the wrong number of points in a shape. If you make a mistake in the output format, the checker will not be able to understand your output and will give you an error.
* **Incorrect solution:** Even if your input and output formats are correct, your solution might still be incorrect. For example, you might not be using the scissors and tape operations correctly, or you might not be producing a shape that is equivalent to the target shape. If your solution is incorrect, the checker will give you a score of 0.
* **Time limit:** The time limit for this problem is 2 seconds. If your solution takes longer than 2 seconds to run, it will be marked as incorrect.
* **Memory limit:** The memory limit for this problem is 256 MB. If your solution uses more than 256 MB of memory, it will be marked as incorrect.

To avoid these problems, make sure to carefully read the problem statement and the input and output formats. Test your solution on a few small examples before submitting it to the checker. And, if you are running out of time or memory, try to optimize your solution.

CODEFORCES 1210_E. Wojtek and Card Tricks

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible that the input will be in a different format than expected. For example, the input may contain spaces between the numbers, or it may contain commas instead of spaces. If the input is not in the correct format, the program will not be able to correctly parse it and will produce an incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is possible that the output will be in a different format than expected. For example, the output may contain spaces between the numbers, or it may contain commas instead of spaces. If the output is not in the correct format, the program will not be able to correctly print it and will produce an incorrect result.

**3. Incorrect calculation**

The program may incorrectly calculate the number of different decks that Wojtek can generate. This could happen if the program does not correctly account for all of the possible ways to shuffle the deck. For example, the program may not correctly account for the fact that some tricks may cancel each other out.

**4. Memory leak**

The program may leak memory if it does not properly free up the memory that it allocates. This could eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

**5. Race condition**

The program may experience a race condition if two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This could lead to the program producing incorrect results or crashing.

**6. Deadlock**

The program may deadlock if two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This could lead to the program being stuck in an infinite loop and never finishing.

Pain points:
**1. The input data may not be valid.** For example, the input may contain negative numbers, or the number of rows or columns may be less than 3. The developer should check the input data for validity and raise an error if it is not valid.

**2. The developer may not correctly implement the algorithm for finding the maximum possible sum of matrix elements.** The algorithm should consider all possible ways of replacing the zeros with positive numbers and find the one that results in the maximum sum. The developer should be careful to avoid any off-by-one errors or other mistakes in the implementation of the algorithm.

**3. The developer may not correctly output the results.** The output should be a single integer, which is the maximum possible sum of matrix elements. The developer should be careful to format the output correctly and to avoid any typos.

**4. The developer may not handle corner cases correctly.** For example, the input may contain a matrix with all zeros, or the input may contain a matrix with no zeros. The developer should handle these corner cases correctly and ensure that the output is correct.

**5. The developer may not be able to optimize the solution.** The time complexity of the algorithm for finding the maximum possible sum of matrix elements is O(n^2m^2). The developer should try to optimize the algorithm to improve the performance.

CODEFORCES 1252_F. Regular Forestation

Pain points:
```
1. The input is a tree of 13 nodes.
2. The edges of the tree are: (1, 5), (1, 7), (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 11), (3, 12), (4, 7), (4, 12), (6, 11), (7, 13), (9, 10), (9, 12).
3. By removing node 4, we will get three disconnected trees: \{5, 1, 7, 13\}, \{8, 2, 11, 6\}, and \{3, 12, 9, 10\}.
4. All those disconnected trees are pairwise identical.
5. Thus, the maximum number of disconnected trees that can be obtained by removing exactly one good cutting point is 3.

CODEFORCES 1272_E. Nearest Opposite Parity

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a number of elements that is not equal to n, or the elements may not be integers in the range 1 to n.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may contain a number of elements that is not equal to n, or the elements may not be integers in the range 1 to n.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of moves**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the minimum number of moves required to reach a position with the opposite parity. For example, the developer may not consider all possible paths from the starting position to the target position, or the developer may not take into account the cost of each move.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. The developer may not handle edge cases correctly. For example, the developer may not handle the case where the starting position or the target position is not valid, or the developer may not handle the case where there is no path from the starting position to the target position.
5. **Memory leaks**. The developer may not free up memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
6. **Synchronization issues**. The developer may not synchronize access to shared resources correctly. This can lead to data corruption or deadlocks.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1295_F. Good Contest

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is a little bit tricky. It is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you accidentally read the first line as "2 3" instead of "2 ≤ n ≤ 50", your program will crash.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the probability**

The probability that there will be no inversions in the contest can be expressed as an irreducible fraction x/y, where y is coprime with 998244353. To calculate this probability, you need to find two integers x and y such that x/y is the desired fraction and gcd(x, y) = 1. One way to do this is to use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

**3. Incorrect modulo operation**

When computing the value of xy^{-1} modulo 998244353, you need to make sure that you are using the correct modulo operation. The modulo operation in Python is denoted by the % operator. However, this operator does not always work the way you expect it to. For example, if you compute 1000000007 % 1000000007, you will get the value 0, even though the correct answer is 1.

To avoid this problem, you can use the following function to compute the modulo operation:

```
def mod(a, m):
    if a < 0:
        a += m
    return a % m
```

**4. Incorrect use of the factorial function**

The factorial function in Python is denoted by the factorial() function. However, this function does not always work the way you expect it to. For example, if you compute factorial(998244353), you will get the value -1, even though the correct answer is 0.

To avoid this problem, you can use the following function to compute the factorial function:

```
def factorial(n):
    if n < 0:
        return -1
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

**5. Incorrect use of the gcd function**

The gcd function in Python is denoted by the gcd() function. However, this function does not always work the way you expect it to. For example, if you compute gcd(998244353, 1), you will get the value 998244353, even though the correct answer is 1.

To avoid this problem, you can use the following function to compute the gcd function:

```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect modular arithmetic**

When calculating the strength of a battalion, you may accidentally use the wrong modulus. For example, you may calculate the strength modulo $10^9$ instead of $10^9+7$. This will result in incorrect answers.

**2. Incorrect use of factorials**

When calculating the strength of a battalion, you may accidentally use the factorial of a negative number. This will result in an error.

**3. Incorrect use of the Chinese remainder theorem**

When calculating the strength of the army, you may accidentally use the Chinese remainder theorem incorrectly. This will result in incorrect answers.

**4. Incorrect use of floating-point numbers**

When calculating the strength of the army, you may accidentally use floating-point numbers. This will result in incorrect answers.

**5. Incorrect use of big integers**

When calculating the strength of the army, you may accidentally use big integers that are too large. This will result in an overflow error.

**6. Incorrect use of bit operations**

When calculating the strength of the army, you may accidentally use bit operations incorrectly. This will result in incorrect answers.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1338_B. Edge Weight Assignment

Pain points:
**1. Incorrectly assigning the weights to the edges.**

This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. They will often assign the weights to the edges in a way that does not satisfy the given constraints. For example, they might assign the same weight to two edges that are on the same path between two leaves. This will cause the bitwise XOR of the weights of the edges on the path to be non-zero, which is not allowed.

**2. Using too many distinct weights.**

Another common mistake is to use too many distinct weights. This can lead to a larger value of f than is necessary. For example, if there are only two leaves in the tree, then it is only necessary to use two distinct weights. Using more than two weights will not increase the minimum value of f, but it will increase the maximum value of f.

**3. Not considering all possible assignments of weights.**

When solving this problem, it is important to consider all possible assignments of weights to the edges. This is because the minimum and maximum values of f can vary depending on the assignment of weights. For example, if there are only two leaves in the tree, then the minimum value of f is 1 if the two edges are assigned the same weight, and the maximum value of f is 2 if the two edges are assigned different weights.

**4. Using incorrect data structures.**

The data structures that you use to solve this problem can have a significant impact on the performance of your solution. For example, if you use a linked list to store the edges of the tree, then your solution will be much slower than if you use a hash table.

**5. Not using the most efficient algorithms.**

There are a number of different algorithms that you can use to solve this problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. For example, the brute-force algorithm is very inefficient, but the dynamic programming algorithm is much more efficient.

**6. Making a mistake in your implementation.**

Even if you understand the problem and have a good algorithm, you can still make a mistake in your implementation. This is why it is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it.
Test inputs:
**1. Incorrectly assigning the weights to the edges.**

```

Title:
CODEFORCES 1360_A. Minimal Square

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong formula**

The formula for the area of a square is `a^2`, where `a` is the side length. So, to find the minimum area of a square that contains two identical rectangles, you would need to find the smallest value of `a` that satisfies the following equation:

```
a^2 >= 2ab
```

However, this formula is incorrect. The correct formula is:

```
a^2 >= max(a, b)^2
```

This is because the two rectangles can be rotated so that they are touching at a corner, in which case the minimum area of the square that contains them is `max(a, b)^2`.

**2. Not considering all possible rotations**

When finding the minimum area of a square that contains two identical rectangles, you need to consider all possible rotations of the rectangles. For example, if the two rectangles are both squares with side length `a`, then the minimum area of the square that contains them is `a^2`. However, if you only consider the rotation where the two squares are aligned with each other, then the minimum area of the square that contains them is `2a^2`.

**3. Not handling invalid inputs**

The input to this problem may contain invalid values. For example, the side lengths of the rectangles may be negative or zero. In these cases, you should print `-1` as the output.

**4. Using floating-point numbers**

The input to this problem is given in integers. So, you should use integers to represent the side lengths of the rectangles and the area of the square. Using floating-point numbers can lead to rounding errors, which can cause your answer to be incorrect.

**5. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The most efficient algorithm for finding the minimum area of a square that contains two identical rectangles is to use a binary search. This algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half until the minimum area is found.

The following is an implementation of the binary search algorithm in Python:

```python
def find_min_area(a, b):
  """
  Finds the minimum area of a square that contains two identical rectangles with side lengths a and b.

  Parameters:
    a: The side length of one of the rectangles.
    b: The side length of the other rectangle.

  Returns:
    The minimum area of the square that contains both rectangles.
  """

  # Initialize the search space.
  low = min(a, b)
  high = max(a, b) * 2

  # Perform a binary search.
  while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2

    # Check if the square with side length mid contains both rectangles.
    if mid >= a and mid >= b:
      # The square with side length mid contains both rectangles.
      # Update the minimum area and continue the search.
      low = mid + 1
      min_area = mid * mid
    else:
      # The square with side length mid does not contain both rectangles.
      # Update the search space and continue the search.
      high = mid - 1

  # The minimum area is the value of min_area.
  return min_area
```
Test inputs:
The following program inputs will validate whether an implementation meets each of the requirements listed above:

1. Using the wrong formula

```

3. Not handling invalid inputs

```
-1 0
```

4. Using floating-point numbers

```
3.1 2.2
```

The correct answer is 16, but the implementation will return 16.0.

5. Not using the most efficient algorithm

```
100 100

CODEFORCES 1469_D. Ceil Divisions

Pain points:

 You've got array with 3 ones and 1 two in 3 steps. **1. Using the wrong data type**

The input is a list of integers, so you should use the `int` data type to store the values. If you use a smaller data type, such as `short`, you may lose precision and get incorrect results.

**2. Not handling boundary cases correctly**

The problem states that `n` is at least 3, so you should make sure to handle the case where `n == 3` correctly. In this case, the answer is `2`, and you should print `2` followed by the two pairs of indices `(3, 2)` and `(3, 2)`.

**3. Using inefficient algorithms**

The problem can be solved in linear time using a simple greedy algorithm. A more efficient solution would be to use a dynamic programming approach.

**4. Not testing your code**

It is always important to test your code before submitting it to a competition. This will help you catch any bugs and ensure that your code runs correctly.

**5. Not following the problem statement**

CODEFORCES 1494_F. Delete The Edges

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect graph representation**. The graph is represented as an adjacency list, where each vertex is represented by a list of its adjacent vertices. However, the graph is not connected, so it is impossible to destroy all of its edges.
2. **Incorrect mode shift operation**. The mode shift operation can only be performed when the current vertex has at least two undestroyed adjacent vertices. However, in the given example, the current vertex has only one undestroyed adjacent vertex, so the mode shift operation cannot be performed.
3. **Incorrect edge destruction**. The edges are destroyed in the following way: the first edge after the mode shift is not destroyed, the second one is destroyed, the third one is not destroyed, the fourth one is destroyed, and so on. However, in the given example, the first edge after the mode shift is destroyed, which is incorrect.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a sequence of k integers, where k is the number of actions and each integer is either the index of the next vertex in the traversal or -1 if the mode shift operation is performed. However, in the given example, the output is not in the correct format.
5. **Incorrect number of actions**. The number of actions should be k ≤ 2m + 2, where m is the number of edges in the graph. However, in the given example, the number of actions is k > 2m + 2.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the constraints. It is also important to correctly implement the graph representation and the mode shift operation. Finally, it is important to correctly format the output and to ensure that the number of actions is within the specified limits.

CODEFORCES 1517_E. Group Photo

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The most common mistake is to implement the algorithm incorrectly. This can lead to incorrect results or even a runtime error.

**2. Using incorrect data types**

Another common mistake is to use incorrect data types. For example, if you are working with large numbers, you should use a data type that can represent them accurately.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of mistake that can occur when you are counting or indexing. For example, if you are counting the number of elements in an array, you might accidentally count one element too many or too few.

**4. Using uninitialized variables**

Uninitialized variables can contain any value, which can lead to incorrect results. It is important to initialize variables before using them.

**5. Not handling edge cases**

Edge cases are special cases that can occur in your code that you may not have anticipated. For example, if you are sorting an array, you need to handle the case where the array is empty.

**6. Using a brute-force approach**

A brute-force approach is an algorithm that tries every possible solution to a problem. This can be very inefficient, especially for large problems.

**7. Not using the right data structure**

The right data structure can make your code much more efficient. For example, if you are sorting an array, you should use a sorting algorithm that is designed for arrays.

**8. Not using the right algorithm**

The right algorithm can make your code much more efficient. For example, if you are searching for an element in an array, you should use a search algorithm that is designed for arrays.

**9. Not using memoization**

Memoization can be used to speed up recursive algorithms. This is done by storing the results of subproblems so that they do not need to be recomputed.

**10. Not using parallelism**

Parallelism can be used to speed up some algorithms. This is done by running multiple parts of the algorithm at the same time.

CODEFORCES 1545_D. AquaMoon and Wrong Coordinate

Pain points:
 **Possible problems and bugs:**

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, you might forget to include a space between two numbers, or you might accidentally put a comma instead of a space. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the modified coordinate**. The modified coordinate is calculated by adding the speed of the person to their initial coordinate and then subtracting the number of moments that have passed. If you make a mistake in this calculation, the program will output the wrong answer.
3. **Incorrect identification of the person whose coordinate was modified**. The person whose coordinate was modified is identified by their index in the array of people. If you make a mistake in this identification, the program will output the wrong answer.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output for this problem should be a single line with two integers: the moment that the coordinate was modified and the original coordinate. If you don't format the output correctly, the program will not be able to read it.
5. **Other errors**. There are a number of other possible errors that could occur when solving this problem, such as incorrect memory management or incorrect use of the programming language's features. These errors can be difficult to debug, so it's important to be careful when writing your code.

CODEFORCES 23_D. Tetragon

Pain points:

 **1. The input format is not correct**. The input format is "T x1,y1 x2,y2 x3,y3", where T is the number of test cases, and x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3 are the coordinates of the three equal sides of a strictly convex tetragon. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will output incorrect results.

**2. The output format is not correct**. The output format is "YES\n(x1,y1) (x2,y2) (x3,y3) (x4,y4)", where YES indicates that the required tetragon exists, and (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), (x4,y4) are the coordinates of the four vertices of the tetragon in clockwise or counter-clockwise order. If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly output the results and will not be able to pass the test cases.

**3. The program does not correctly check if the required tetragon exists**. To check if the required tetragon exists, the program must first check if the three equal sides of the tetragon are collinear. If the three equal sides of the tetragon are collinear, then the tetragon does not exist. The program must also check if the four vertices of the tetragon are all distinct. If any of the four vertices of the tetragon are not distinct, then the tetragon does not exist.

**4. The program does not correctly calculate the coordinates of the four vertices of the tetragon**. The coordinates of the four vertices of the tetragon can be calculated using the following formulas:

```
x1 = (x1 + x2 + x3) / 3
y1 = (y1 + y2 + y3) / 3
x2 = (x1 + x2 + x4) / 3
y2 = (y1 + y2 + y4) / 3
x3 = (x3 + x4 + x1) / 3
y3 = (y3 + y4 + y1) / 3
x4 = (x3 + x4 + x2) / 3
y4 = (y3 + y4 + y2) / 3
```

If the program does not correctly calculate the coordinates of the four vertices of the tetragon, the output will be incorrect.

**5. The program does not output the results in the correct format**. The program must output the results in the following format:

```
YES
(x1,y1) (x2,y2) (x3,y3) (x4,y4)
```

If the program does not output the results in the correct format, the output will be incorrect.

CODEFORCES 265_B. Roadside Trees (Simplified Edition)

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type to store the heights of the trees.** The heights of the trees can be very large, so it is important to use a data type that can store them accurately. For example, using an integer to store the heights of the trees could result in an overflow error.
2. **Not taking into account the fact that Liss can jump to the next tree.** When Liss is at height h of the tree i, she can jump to height h of the tree i + 1. This can save her a lot of time, so it is important to take this into account when computing the minimum time required to eat all the nuts.
3. **Making a mistake in the calculation of the minimum time required to eat all the nuts.** The minimum time required to eat all the nuts is the sum of the time required to walk up to the top of each tree, the time required to eat the nut on top of each tree, and the time required to jump to the next tree. It is important to be careful when calculating each of these times, as a mistake could result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Not handling the special case where the last tree is shorter than the height that Liss is currently at.** In this case, Liss cannot jump to the next tree, so she must walk down to the top of the last tree before she can eat the nut. It is important to handle this special case correctly, as a mistake could result in an incorrect answer.

CODEFORCES 453_A. Little Pony and Expected Maximum

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect calculation of the expected value**. The expected value of a random variable is the sum of the product of each possible outcome and its probability. For example, if the random variable X can take on the values 1, 2, and 3 with probabilities 1/2, 1/4, and 1/4, respectively, then the expected value of X is (1 * 1/2) + (2 * 1/4) + (3 * 1/4) = 2.

In the problem statement, we are given a dice with m faces, where the first face contains 1 dot, the second face contains 2 dots, and so on, the m-th face contains m dots. We are also told that each face appears with probability 1 / m. To calculate the expected maximum number of dots that Twilight Sparkle could get after tossing the dice n times, we need to sum the product of each possible outcome and its probability. The possible outcomes are the maximum number of dots that Twilight Sparkle could get after each toss of the dice. For example, if Twilight Sparkle tosses the dice once, the possible outcomes are 1, 2, ..., m. The probability of each outcome is 1 / m. So the expected maximum number of dots that Twilight Sparkle could get after tossing the dice once is (1 * 1 / m) + (2 * 1 / m) + ... + (m * 1 / m) = (m + 1) / 2.

**2. Incorrect use of the binomial distribution**. The binomial distribution is a probability distribution that describes the number of successes in a sequence of independent experiments, each of which has a constant probability of success. In the problem statement, we are told that each toss of the dice is independent from others. This means that we can use the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of getting a certain number of dots on the dice.

The binomial distribution is defined by the following formula:

```
P(X = x) = nCx * p^x * (1 - p)^(n - x)
```

where

* X is the number of successes
* n is the number of experiments
* p is the probability of success
* C is the binomial coefficient

In the problem statement, we are given m and n. We can use these values to calculate the probability of getting a certain number of dots on the dice. For example, if we want to calculate the probability of getting 3 dots on the dice, we would use the following formula:

```
P(X = 3) = nC3 * (1 / m)^3 * (1 - 1 / m)^(n - 3)
```

**3. Incorrect use of the central limit theorem**. The central limit theorem states that the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases. This means that if we take a large number of samples from a population, the distribution of the sample means will be bell-shaped and symmetrical.

In the problem statement, we are given m and n. We can use these values to calculate the expected value of the sample mean. The expected value of the sample mean is the same as the expected value of the population. So the expected value of the sample mean is (m + 1) / 2.

We can also use the central limit theorem to calculate the standard deviation of the sample mean. The standard deviation of the sample mean is the square root of the variance of the population divided by the sample size. The variance of the population is (m^2 - 1) / 12. So the standard deviation of the sample mean is sqrt((m^2 - 1) / 12) / n.

We can use the expected value and standard deviation of the sample mean to calculate the probability of getting a certain value of the sample mean. For example, if we want to calculate the probability of getting a sample mean of 3, we would use the following formula:

```
P(X = 3) = 1 / sqrt(2 * pi) * (sqrt((m^2 - 1) / 12) / n) * exp(-(3 - (m + 1) / 2)^2 / 2 * (sqrt((m^2 - 1) / 12) / n)^2)
```
Test inputs:
1. ```
m, n = map(int, input().split())

print((m * n + 1) / 2)
```

2. ```
m, n = map(int, input().split())

```

3. ```
m, n = map(int, input().split())

print(m * (n / m) ** 2)
```

4. ```
m, n = map(int, input().split())

print(m ** (n / m))
```

5. ```
m, n = map(int, input().split())

print(m ** 2 * (n / m) ** 3)
```

CODEFORCES 523_B. Mean Requests

Pain points:
3.000000 3.438441 0.145988
 **Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect calculation of the mean with exponential decay.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when implementing this algorithm. The key to a correct implementation is to use the following formula:

```
mean = (mean + at / T) / c
```

where `mean` is the current value of the mean, `at` is the number of queries that came at the last second, `T` is the length of the time range for which we need the mean number of requests, and `c` is the coefficient of the work of approximate algorithm.

2. **Incorrect calculation of the real mean number of queries for the last T seconds.** This mistake is often made when developers try to calculate the real mean number of queries by simply summing up the number of queries for each second in the time range and dividing by the length of the time range. This is incorrect because the real mean number of queries should be calculated using the following formula:

```
real = sum(at) / (t - T + 1)
```

where `at` is the number of queries that came at second `t`, `T` is the length of the time range for which we need the mean number of requests, and `t` is the current moment of time.

3. **Incorrect calculation of the relative error of the approximate algorithm.** The relative error of the approximate algorithm is calculated using the following formula:

```
error = abs(approx - real) / real
```

where `approx` is the approximate value of the mean, `real` is the real value of the mean, and `error` is the relative error.

4. **Incorrect formatting of the output.** The output of the program should be formatted in the following way:

```
real approx error
```

where `real` is the real mean number of queries for the last T seconds, `approx` is the approximate value of the mean, and `error` is the relative error.

5. **Incorrect input.** The input of the program should be in the following format:

```
n T c
at1 at2 ... atn
m
pj1 pj2 ... pjm
```

where `n` is the number of seconds, `T` is the length of the time range for which we need the mean number of requests, `c` is the coefficient of the work of approximate algorithm, `at1` through `atn` are the number of queries for each second, `m` is the number of moments of time when we are interested in the mean number of queries for the last T seconds, and `pj1` through `pjm` are the moments of time for which we need statistics.

However, some developers may accidentally calculate the determinant as follows:

```
|a b|
|c d|

```

This will result in an incorrect answer.

2. **Incorrect calculation of the norm.** The norm of a matrix is defined as the maximum of the absolute values of its elements. However, some developers may accidentally calculate the norm as the sum of the absolute values of the elements. This will also result in an incorrect answer.

3. **Incorrect choice of degenerate matrix.** The goal of the problem is to find a degenerate matrix B such that the norm ||A - B|| is minimized. However, some developers may accidentally choose a degenerate matrix that does not minimize the norm. This will also result in an incorrect answer.

4. **Incorrect rounding of the answer.** The problem states that the answer must be rounded to within 10^-9. However, some developers may accidentally round the answer to a greater precision. This will also result in an incorrect answer.

5. **Incorrect use of floating-point arithmetic.** Floating-point arithmetic is not exact, and some developers may accidentally make mistakes when using it. This can lead to incorrect answers.

6. **Incorrect use of the `cin` and `cout` functions.** The `cin` and `cout` functions can be used to read and write data from the console. However, some developers may accidentally use these functions incorrectly. This can lead to incorrect answers.

7. **Incorrect use of the `assert` macro.** The `assert` macro can be used to check for errors in your code. However, some developers may accidentally use this macro incorrectly. This can lead to incorrect answers.

8. **Incorrect use of the `std::vector` class.** The `std::vector` class can be used to store a collection of elements. However, some developers may accidentally use this class incorrectly. This can lead to incorrect answers.

9. **Incorrect use of the `std::algorithm` library.** The `std::algorithm` library contains a number of functions that can be used to perform common operations on data. However, some developers may accidentally use this library incorrectly. This can lead to incorrect answers.

CODEFORCES 690_C3. Brain Network (hard)

Pain points:
The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are as follows:

1. **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is very specific. If the input format is not followed correctly, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
2. **Incorrect data type:** The data type of the input and output values must be correct. For example, if the input values are integers, but the output values are strings, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
3. **Off-by-one errors:** Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that can occur when iterating through a list or array. For example, if you are iterating through a list of numbers and you accidentally start at index 0 instead of index 1, you will miss the first element in the list.
4. **Indexing errors:** Indexing errors can occur when you are accessing elements of a list or array. For example, if you try to access an element of a list that does not exist, the program will crash.
5. **Logic errors:** Logic errors can occur when the logic of your program is incorrect. For example, if you are trying to find the maximum value in a list, but you are not using the correct algorithm, the program will not be able to find the correct answer.

By following the tips below, you can help to avoid these common problems and bugs:

1. **Be careful to follow the input format exactly.** If you are not sure about the input format, you can always refer to the problem statement.

CODEFORCES 714_B. Filya and Homework

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if the input contains a number that is too large, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if the output contains a space between two numbers, the program may not be accepted.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, if the algorithm does not take into account all possible cases, the program may not find the correct answer.
4. **Incorrect data**. The data used to test the program may be incorrect. For example, if the data contains a number that is too large, the program may crash.
5. **Incorrect implementation**. The program may be incorrectly implemented. For example, if the program uses a variable that is not initialized, the program may crash.
6. **Incorrect debugging**. The program may be incorrectly debugged. For example, if the program uses a print statement to print the value of a variable, the program may not be able to find the bug.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the program with different data sets to make sure that it is working correctly.

CODEFORCES 734_E. Anton and Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the parsing of the input data. For example, if the number of vertices is not a positive integer, or if the colors of the vertices are not 0 or 1, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect graph representation.** The graph is represented as a list of edges, where each edge is a pair of vertices. However, the edges may not be represented in the correct order, or they may not be unique. This can lead to errors in the traversal of the graph and the calculation of the minimum number of operations.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of operations.** The minimum number of operations is calculated by finding the number of vertices that are not the same color as the majority of the vertices in the graph. However, this calculation may be incorrect if the graph is not connected, or if there are multiple connected components with different colors.
4. **Incorrect output.** The output should be a single integer, which is the minimum number of operations required to make all vertices of the tree the same color. However, the output may be incorrect if the minimum number of operations is not a whole number, or if the output is not formatted correctly.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully follow the input format and to correctly represent the graph. The minimum number of operations should be calculated carefully, and the output should be formatted correctly.

CODEFORCES 803_B. Distances to Zero

Pain points:
```
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not specified clearly, so it is easy to make mistakes when reading the input. For example, if the input is a list of numbers, you might accidentally read it as a string and get a wrong answer.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not specified clearly, so it is easy to make mistakes when writing the output. For example, if the output is a list of numbers, you might accidentally print them out as a string and get a wrong answer.
3. **Incorrect calculation of distances**. The distances to zero are calculated by finding the index of the nearest zero element. However, if there are multiple zero elements, it is not clear which one to use. For example, if the input is `[2, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 2, 4]`, the distance to the first zero element is 1, but the distance to the second zero element is 2.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. When calculating the distances, it is easy to make off-by-one errors. For example, if the input is `[2, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 2, 4]`, the distance to the first zero element is 1, but the distance to the second zero element is 2.
5. **Incorrect use of pointers**. When using pointers to iterate over an array, it is easy to make mistakes. For example, if you are iterating over an array of integers, you might accidentally increment the pointer by one instead of two.
6. **Memory leaks**. When allocating memory for an array, it is important to free the memory when you are finished with it. Otherwise, you will have a memory leak.
7. **Undefined behavior**. When writing code, it is important to avoid undefined behavior. For example, if you divide by zero, the program will crash.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. When writing code, it is important to avoid security vulnerabilities. For example, if you allow users to input data, you should make sure that the data is sanitized before it is used.
9. **Performance issues**. When writing code, it is important to optimize the performance of your code. For example, you should avoid using loops if you can use a more efficient data structure.
10. **Usability issues**. When writing code, it is important to make your code easy to use. For example, you should provide clear documentation and error messages.

Title:
CODEFORCES 84_A. Toy Army

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that `n` should be an integer between 2 and 108, inclusive, and even. However, a developer may accidentally hard-code a value that does not meet these criteria, or they may incorrectly parse the input and end up with an invalid value. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of soldiers that can be killed.** The maximum number of soldiers that can be killed is equal to the number of soldiers in each army multiplied by the number of turns in the game. However, a developer may accidentally forget to multiply these two values together, or they may use the wrong value for the number of turns. This could cause the program to produce incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer that represents the maximum number of soldiers that can be killed. However, a developer may accidentally output multiple values, or they may output a value that is not an integer. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
4. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other potential bugs that a developer could encounter when solving this problem, such as:
    * Using the wrong data type for `n`
    * Using an incorrect algorithm to calculate the maximum number of soldiers that can be killed
    * Failing to handle invalid input
    * Failing to handle errors gracefully

Title:
CODEFORCES 871_C. Points, Lines and Ready-made Titles

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is given as integers, but the problem statement asks for the answer modulo 10^9 + 7. This means that we need to use a data type that can store numbers larger than 10^9. The default data type for integers in Python is int, which can only store numbers up to 2^31 - 1. This is not enough for our problem, so we need to use a larger data type such as long.

**2. Not using the modulo operator**

The problem statement asks for the answer modulo 10^9 + 7. This means that we need to use the modulo operator (%) to ensure that our answer is within the range 0 to 10^9 + 7. For example, if we have the number 100 and we want to find its remainder when divided by 10^9 + 7, we would do the following:

```
100 % (10**9 + 7)
```

This would give us the answer 3.

**3. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a simple algorithm. We can first sort the points by their x-coordinate. Then, for each point, we can count the number of points to the left of it and the number of points to the right of it. The number of distinct pictures that we can get is then the product of these two numbers.

**4. Making a mistake in the implementation**

Once we have come up with an algorithm to solve the problem, we need to be careful when implementing it. There are a few common mistakes that people make when implementing algorithms, such as:

* Using the wrong data type
* Not using the modulo operator
* Using the wrong algorithm
* Making a mistake in the implementation

By being careful when implementing our algorithm, we can avoid these common mistakes and ensure that our code is correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 898_C. Phone Numbers

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type for storing phone numbers.**

The input data contains phone numbers that can contain leading zeros. If we store phone numbers as strings, we will need to remove the leading zeros before comparing them. This can be done using the `lstrip()` method, but it is an unnecessary complication. A better solution is to store phone numbers as integers. This will allow us to compare them directly without any need for processing.

**2. Not handling duplicate phone numbers correctly.**

The input data may contain duplicate phone numbers. For example, the following data contains two phone numbers that are identical:

```
ivan 1 123
petr 1 123
```

If we simply print out all of the phone numbers, we will print the duplicate number twice. A better solution is to only print out each phone number once. We can do this by using a set to store the unique phone numbers.

**3. Not handling phone numbers with different formats correctly.**

The input data may contain phone numbers in different formats. For example, the following data contains two phone numbers that are different only in the format of the area code:

```
ivan 1 415-555-1212
petr 1 555-1212
```

If we simply compare the phone numbers as strings, we will incorrectly determine that they are not the same. A better solution is to convert the phone numbers to a common format before comparing them.

**4. Not handling phone numbers with leading zeros correctly.**

The input data may contain phone numbers with leading zeros. For example, the following data contains a phone number with a leading zero:

```
ivan 1 0123
```

If we simply compare the phone numbers as strings, we will incorrectly determine that the phone number does not have a leading zero. A better solution is to remove the leading zeros before comparing the phone numbers.

**5. Not handling phone numbers with different lengths correctly.**

The input data may contain phone numbers of different lengths. For example, the following data contains two phone numbers that are different in length:

```
ivan 1 123
petr 1 123456
```

If we simply compare the phone numbers as strings, we will incorrectly determine that they are not the same. A better solution is to convert the phone numbers to a common length before comparing them.

**6. Not handling phone numbers with different separators correctly.**

The input data may contain phone numbers with different separators. For example, the following data contains two phone numbers that are different only in the separator:

```
ivan 1 123-456-7890
petr 1 1234567890
```

If we simply compare the phone numbers as strings, we will incorrectly determine that they are not the same. A better solution is to convert the phone numbers to a common separator before comparing them.

Title:
CODEFORCES 919_D. Substring

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is a graph with n nodes and m directed edges. One lowercase letter is assigned to each node. We define a path's value as the number of the most frequently occurring letter. For example, if letters on a path are "abaca", then the value of that path is 3. Your task is find a path whose value is the largest.

The input data is in the form of two lines. The first line contains two positive integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 300 000), denoting that the graph has n nodes and m directed edges.

The second line contains a string s with only lowercase English letters. The i-th character is the letter assigned to the i-th node.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers x, y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n), describing a directed edge from x to y. Note that x can be equal to y and there can be multiple edges between x and y. Also the graph can be not connected.

Output

Output a single line with a single integer denoting the largest value. If the value can be arbitrarily large, output -1 instead.

Output

Note

In the first sample, the path with largest value is 1 → 3 → 4 → 5. The value is 3 because the letter 'a' appears 3 times.

If the input data is not in the correct format, the program will crash. For example, if the first line of the input data is "1 2 3", the program will crash because the first two integers are not positive.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the largest value**

The largest value is the number of the most frequently occurring letter. For example, if letters on a path are "abaca", then the value of that path is 3.

To calculate the largest value, we need to find the letter that occurs the most frequently in the input string. We can do this by using a hash table. A hash table is a data structure that stores data in a key-value format. The key is the letter, and the value is the number of times the letter occurs in the input string.

Once we have the hash table, we can find the letter that occurs the most frequently by iterating through the hash table and finding the key with the largest value. The value of this key is the largest value.

However, there is a bug in the code that calculates the largest value. The bug is that the code does not check if the hash table is empty. If the hash table is empty, the code will return -1, which is incorrect.

The correct code should check if the hash table is empty before trying to find the letter that occurs the most frequently. If the hash table is empty, the code should return 0.

**3. Incorrect output**

The output of the program should be a single line with a single integer denoting the largest value. If the value can be arbitrarily large, the output should be -1.

However, the code in the question outputs the largest value as a string. This is incorrect. The output should be an integer.

The correct code should output the largest value as an integer. If the value can be arbitrarily large, the output should be -1.

**4. Incorrect error handling**

The code in the question does not handle errors correctly. If there is an error, the code will crash.

The correct code should handle errors correctly. If there is an error, the code should print an error message and exit.

CODEFORCES 946_C. String Transformation

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input string can contain up to 10^5 characters, so it's important to use a data type that can store that many characters. Using a data type that is too small, such as a char array, will cause the program to crash.

**2. Not handling invalid input correctly**

The input string may contain invalid characters, such as non-alphabetic characters or characters that are not in the correct order. The program should handle these cases gracefully, such as by printing an error message or exiting.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve the problem must be correct. A incorrect algorithm may not find the correct answer, or it may take a very long time to run.

**4. Not handling edge cases correctly**

The program should handle edge cases correctly. For example, the program should handle the case where the input string is empty.

**5. Not testing the program thoroughly**

It's important to test the program thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly. This includes testing for all possible input cases, as well as edge cases.

CODEFORCES 994_F. Compute Power

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two integers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when printing the output. For example, if you forget to multiply the answer by 1000, the program will not produce the correct output.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When working with arrays, it is easy to make off-by-one errors. For example, if you iterate over an array from 0 to n-1, you will miss the last element.

**4. Logical errors**

When solving a problem, it is important to think carefully about the solution and to avoid logical errors. For example, if you are trying to find the maximum value in an array, you need to make sure that you check all of the elements in the array.

**5. Runtime errors**

When writing a program, it is important to make sure that it runs correctly. For example, you need to make sure that you allocate enough memory for your data structures and that you handle all of the possible exceptions.

**6. Memory leaks**

HACKEREARTH harry-the-mathemagician-2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of modulo operator**. The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 5 % 2 returns 1 because 5 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. However, if you try to use the modulo operator to check if a number is even or odd, you will get the wrong answer. For example, 5 % 2 returns 1, which means that 5 is odd. But 6 % 2 returns 0, which means that 6 is even.
2. **Incorrect use of the bitwise AND operator**. The bitwise AND operator (&&) returns 1 if both of its operands are 1. For example, 1 && 1 returns 1, but 0 && 1 returns 0. However, if you try to use the bitwise AND operator to check if a number is even or odd, you will get the wrong answer. For example, 5 && 1 returns 0, which means that 5 is odd. But 6 && 1 returns 1, which means that 6 is even.
3. **Incorrect use of the bitwise OR operator**. The bitwise OR operator (||) returns 1 if either of its operands is 1. For example, 1 || 1 returns 1, but 0 || 1 returns 1. However, if you try to use the bitwise OR operator to check if a number is even or odd, you will get the wrong answer. For example, 5 || 1 returns 1, which means that 5 is odd. But 6 || 1 returns 1, which means that 6 is even.
4. **Incorrect use of the bitwise NOT operator**. The bitwise NOT operator (^) returns the opposite of its operand. For example, ~1 returns 0, but ~0 returns 1. However, if you try to use the bitwise NOT operator to check if a number is even or odd, you will get the wrong answer. For example, ~5 returns -6, which is not even or odd. But ~6 returns -7, which is odd.
5. **Incorrect use of the conditional operator**. The conditional operator (? :) returns the first operand if the condition is true, and the second operand if the condition is false. For example, 5 ? 1 : 0 returns 1, but 6 ? 1 : 0 returns 0. However, if you try to use the conditional operator to check if a number is even or odd, you will get the wrong answer. For example, 5 ? 1 : 0 returns 1, which means that 5 is odd. But 6 ? 1 : 0 returns 0, which means that 6 is even.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The variable `n` should be of type `int`, but it is of type `str` in the following code:

```
n, k = input().split()
```

2. **Incorrect operator:** The operator `%=` should be used to calculate the remainder, but the following code uses the operator `//=`, which calculates the quotient:

```
if (n // k) == 0:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

3. **Off-by-one error:** The following code incorrectly checks if `n` is divisible by `k`:

```
if (n % k) == 0:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")

Title:
HACKEREARTH mystery-9

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator**. The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 is 1 because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1. However, some developers mistakenly use the modulo operator to check if a number is divisible by another number. For example, the following code will incorrectly print "divisible" if n is divisible by 3:

```
if (n % 3 == 0) {
  printf("divisible");
}
```

The correct way to check if a number is divisible by another number is to use the bitwise AND operator (&). For example, the following code will correctly print "divisible" if n is divisible by 3:

```
if (n & 3 == 0) {
  printf("divisible");
}
```

2. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a developer forgets to add or subtract one from a calculation. For example, the following code will incorrectly print the sum of the first 10 numbers:

```
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  sum += i;
}
printf("sum = %d\n", sum);
```

The correct code should be:

```
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  sum += i;
}
printf("sum = %d\n", sum);
```

3. **Incorrect use of pointers**. Pointers are a powerful tool that can be used to access memory directly. However, they can also be a source of bugs if they are not used correctly. For example, the following code will incorrectly print the value of the variable x:

```
int x = 10;
int *p = &x;
printf("*p = %d\n", *p);
```

The correct code should be:

```
int x = 10;
int *p = &x;
printf("*p = %d\n", x);
```

4. **Use of uninitialized variables**. Uninitialized variables are variables that have not been assigned a value. Using uninitialized variables can lead to unpredictable behavior and security vulnerabilities. For example, the following code will incorrectly print the value of the variable y:

```
int x = 10;
int y;
printf("y = %d\n", y);
```

The correct code should be:

```
int x = 10;
int y = 20;
printf("y = %d\n", y);
```

5. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers**. Floating-point numbers are a type of number that can represent both positive and negative numbers, as well as decimals. However, floating-point numbers can be a source of bugs if they are not used correctly. For example, the following code will incorrectly print the value of pi:

```
double pi = 3.14159;
printf("pi = %f\n", pi);
```

The correct code should be:

```
double pi = 3.141592653589793;
printf("pi = %f\n", pi);

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect logic**

The most common bug is an incorrect logic in the code. For example, the developer might forget to check if all the vertices of the rectangle are inside the circle.

**2. Incorrect data type**

Another common bug is using the incorrect data type for the input or output. For example, the developer might use a float for the radius of the circle, when it should be an integer.

**3. Off-by-one error**

An off-by-one error occurs when the developer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to incorrect results.

**4. Undefined behavior**

Undefined behavior occurs when the compiler is not able to determine the output of a program. This can happen when the developer uses uninitialized variables or divides by zero.

**5. Memory leak**

A memory leak occurs when the developer allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

**6. Race condition**

A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.

**7. Deadlock**

A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can prevent the program from making any progress and it will eventually crash.

**8. Stack overflow**

A stack overflow occurs when the program pushes too many items onto the stack. This can cause the program to crash.

**9. Buffer overflow**

A buffer overflow occurs when the program writes data to a buffer that is not big enough. This can cause the program to crash or to execute arbitrary code.

**10. Security vulnerability**

A security vulnerability occurs when the program allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system. This can happen when the developer uses weak passwords or fails to implement security controls.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the fibonacci formula.** The fibonacci formula is $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$, where $F_0 = 0$ and $F_1 = 1$. A common mistake is to use $F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ as the base case, which will result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the fibonacci numbers, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct index. A common mistake is to use $n-1$ instead of $n$, which will result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Modulo arithmetic errors.** When calculating the fibonacci numbers modulo $10^9+7$, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct modulus. A common mistake is to use $10^9$ instead of $10^9+7$, which will result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect use of the factorial function.** The factorial function is defined as $n! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot ... \cdot n$. A common mistake is to use the factorial function incorrectly, such as by using $n! = n(n-1)!$. This will result in an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect use of the binomial coefficient.** The binomial coefficient is defined as $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. A common mistake is to use the binomial coefficient incorrectly, such as by using $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!}$. This will result in an incorrect answer.
6. **Incorrect use of the Lucas number.** The Lucas number is defined as $L_n = L_{n-1} + L_{n-2}$, where $L_0 = 2$ and $L_1 = 1$. A common mistake is to use the Lucas number incorrectly, such as by using $L_n = F_n$. This will result in an incorrect answer.

HACKEREARTH th-ultimate-digit

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is given as two integers, but the output data is a single digit. If the developer uses the wrong data type to store the input data, they may get incorrect results. For example, if the developer uses an integer to store the input data, they may get incorrect results for large powers.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The correct algorithm for finding the last digit of a^b is to repeatedly multiply a by itself, taking the remainder modulo 10 after each multiplication. However, if the developer uses the wrong algorithm, they may get incorrect results. For example, if the developer uses an algorithm that only calculates the first few digits of a^b, they may get incorrect results for large powers.

**3. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

The input data is given as two integers, but the output data is a single digit. If the developer does not check for boundary conditions, they may get incorrect results. For example, if the developer does not check that a is positive, they may get incorrect results for negative powers.

**4. Using floating-point arithmetic**

The input data is given as two integers, but the output data is a single digit. If the developer uses floating-point arithmetic to calculate the last digit of a^b, they may get incorrect results. For example, if the developer uses floating-point arithmetic to calculate the remainder modulo 10, they may get incorrect results for large powers.

**5. Not handling overflow**

The input data is given as two integers, but the output data is a single digit. If the developer does not handle overflow, they may get incorrect results for large powers. For example, if the developer does not check that the product of a and b does not overflow, they may get incorrect results for large powers.

ATCODER p02769 AtCoder Beginner Contest 156 - Roaming

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**

The modulo operator (%) is used to find the remainder of a division. For example, 10 % 3 is 1, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.

In this problem, we need to find the number of possible combinations of numbers of people in the n rooms, modulo (10^9 + 7). This means that we need to find the remainder of the number of combinations when divided by (10^9 + 7).

If we accidentally use the wrong modulo operator, we may get an incorrect answer. For example, if we use the modulo operator (%) instead of the modulo operator (mod), we may get an incorrect answer.

**2. Not using the correct data type**

The input to this problem is a pair of integers, n and k. The value of n can be up to 2 * 10^5, which is a very large number. If we do not use the correct data type to store n, we may get an incorrect answer.

For example, if we use the data type int to store n, we may get an incorrect answer because the value of n may overflow.

**3. Not using the correct algorithm**

The correct algorithm to solve this problem is the following:

1. Initialize a variable called count to 1.
2. For each possible value of k, do the following:
    1. Multiply count by the number of ways to choose k people from n rooms.
    2. Divide count by (k + 1).
3. Subtract 1 from count.
4. Return count.

If we use the wrong algorithm, we may get an incorrect answer.

**4. Not using the correct modular arithmetic techniques**

When working with modulo arithmetic, it is important to use the correct techniques to avoid getting incorrect answers.

For example, when adding two numbers modulo (10^9 + 7), we need to make sure that the sum does not exceed (10^9 + 7). We can do this by reducing the sum modulo (10^9 + 7).

Similarly, when multiplying two numbers modulo (10^9 + 7), we need to make sure that the product does not exceed (10^9 + 7). We can do this by reducing the product modulo (10^9 + 7).

If we do not use the correct modular arithmetic techniques, we may get incorrect answers.

### Possible Problems and Bugs ###

* **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.
* **Incorrect edge traversal**. The program may incorrectly traverse the edges of the graph, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program traverses an edge in the wrong direction, it may not find the shortest path between two vertices.
* **Incorrect tree construction**. The program may incorrectly construct the tree, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program does not connect all of the vertices in the graph, it may not be a tree.
* **Incorrect output format**. The program may output the results in the wrong format, which may make it difficult to understand. For example, if the program outputs the results in a different order than expected, it may be difficult to compare them.

### How to Avoid These Problems and Bugs ###

To avoid these problems and bugs, it is important to carefully follow the input format and to correctly traverse the edges of the graph. The tree should be constructed carefully to ensure that it is a tree. The output should be formatted correctly so that it is easy to understand.

Here are some specific tips for avoiding these problems and bugs:

* Use a programming language that is well-suited for graph traversal, such as Python or Java.
* Use a data structure that is designed for storing and traversing graphs, such as a linked list or a hash table.
* Write unit tests to verify that the program is correctly traversing the edges of the graph and constructing the tree.
* Write a test harness to verify that the program is correctly outputting the results in the correct format.

By following these tips, you can help to ensure that your program is free of errors and that it produces the correct results.

Title:
ATCODER p03649 AtCoder Regular Contest 079 - Decrease (Judge ver.)

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data is a sequence of non-negative integers. If we use an incorrect data type to store the input data, we may get incorrect results. For example, if we use `int` to store the input data, we may get incorrect results for large input data.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the number of times we will perform the operation until the largest element in the sequence becomes N-1 or smaller. A naive algorithm is to iterate through the input data and find the largest element. Then, we decrease the value of the largest element by N and increase each of the other elements by 1. We repeat this process until the largest element becomes N-1 or smaller. However, this algorithm is inefficient because it has to iterate through the input data multiple times.

A more efficient algorithm is to use a heap data structure. A heap is a data structure that can be used to store a set of elements in a way that allows us to find the largest element in the set quickly. We can use a heap to store the input data. Then, we can repeatedly pop the largest element from the heap and decrease its value by N. We repeat this process until the largest element becomes N-1 or smaller. This algorithm is much more efficient than the naive algorithm.

**3. Not handling corner cases**

The problem statement does not explicitly mention any corner cases. However, there are a few corner cases that we need to handle. For example, we need to handle the case where the input data is empty. We also need to handle the case where the largest element in the input data is N-1 or smaller.

**4. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code thoroughly before submitting it. This will help us to catch any bugs in the code. We can test the code by using a variety of input data, including both valid and invalid input data. We can also test the code by using different data types.

**5. Not using a debugger**

A debugger can be a helpful tool for debugging code. A debugger allows us to step through the code line by line and see what is happening at each step. This can help us to identify bugs in the code.

Title:
ATCODER p03805 AtCoder Beginner Contest 054 - One-stroke Path

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always strictly followed, and it is easy to make a mistake when parsing the input. For example, if the input contains a space between the first two numbers, the program may incorrectly parse the first number as two numbers.
2. **Incorrect graph representation.** The graph is represented as a list of edges, where each edge is a pair of vertices. However, it is easy to make a mistake when representing the graph, such as by using the wrong order for the vertices in an edge.
3. **Incorrect traversal of the graph.** The program must traverse the graph in such a way that it visits all the vertices exactly once. However, it is easy to make a mistake when traversing the graph, such as by visiting a vertex twice or not visiting a vertex at all.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the number of paths.** The number of paths that start from vertex 1 and visit all the vertices exactly once can be calculated using the following formula:

```
N! / (2! * (N-2)!)
```

where N is the number of vertices in the graph. However, it is easy to make a mistake when calculating this formula, such as by using the wrong factorial.
5. **Incorrect output.** The program must output the number of paths that start from vertex 1 and visit all the vertices exactly once. However, it is easy to make a mistake when outputting this number, such as by printing the wrong number or by not printing anything at all.

AIZU p00348 Sort

Pain points:
### Possible problems and bugs ###

1. **Off-by-one errors.** The input format specifies that the first row contains the number of elements in the column, and the second row contains the elements themselves. It is easy to make a mistake and write the elements in the first row, or the number of elements in the second row.
2. **Incorrect comparison of elements.** The algorithm compares the selected element with the element immediately before it. It is easy to make a mistake and compare the selected element with the element immediately after it.
3. **Incorrect handling of duplicate elements.** The input specifies that there are no duplicate elements in the column. It is easy to make a mistake and count the number of operations to move an element that is already at the end of the column.
4. **Incorrect handling of the end of the column.** The algorithm terminates when the selected element is at the end of the column. It is easy to make a mistake and continue the algorithm after the selected element has reached the end of the column.
5. **Incorrect calculation of the number of operations.** The algorithm counts the number of operations to move an element immediately after the end of the column. It is easy to make a mistake and count the number of operations to move an element to the end of the column, or the number of operations to move an element to a different location in the column.

### How to avoid these problems and bugs ###

1. **Be careful to follow the input format.** Make sure that you are reading the input correctly and that you are not making any mistakes.
2. **Compare elements carefully.** Make sure that you are comparing the selected element with the correct element.
3. **Check for duplicate elements.** Make sure that you are not counting the number of operations to move an element that is already at the end of the column.
4. **Handle the end of the column correctly.** Make sure that the algorithm terminates when the selected element is at the end of the column.
5. **Calculate the number of operations correctly.** Make sure that you are counting the number of operations to move an element immediately after the end of the column.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces or new lines, or the input may not be a valid integer.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the output may contain extra spaces or new lines, or the output may not be a valid integer.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect. For example, the program may not find the minimum number of squares that need to be repainted, or the program may output an incorrect answer.
4. **Runtime error**. The program may crash or throw an exception. For example, the program may run out of memory, or the program may try to access a non-existent memory address.
5. **Memory leak**. The program may allocate memory that is never freed. This can lead to a decrease in performance and eventually a crash.
6. **Security vulnerability**. The program may be vulnerable to attack. For example, the program may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. The logic of the program should be carefully tested to ensure that it is correct. The program should be tested for runtime errors and memory leaks. Finally, the program should be tested for security vulnerabilities.

Title:
AIZU p00708 Building a Space Station

Pain points:
**Possible Problems and Bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is very specific, and a slight deviation can cause the program to crash. For example, if the number of cells is not a positive integer, or if any of the coordinates or radius values are not in the correct format, the program will not work correctly.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is also very specific, and a slight deviation can cause the program to produce incorrect results. For example, if the output is not rounded to three decimal places, or if the error is greater than 0.001, the program will not be correct.
* **Incorrect calculation of the shortest total length of the corridors:** The shortest total length of the corridors is a complex calculation, and there are many ways to make mistakes. For example, if two cells are not connected, but the program assumes that they are, the total length of the corridors will be incorrect.
* **Inefficient algorithm:** The algorithm used to calculate the shortest total length of the corridors can be very inefficient. For example, if the number of cells is large, the algorithm can take a long time to run.
* **Memory leaks:** The program may leak memory, which can eventually cause the system to crash.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the program thoroughly with a variety of input data sets. Finally, it is important to use an efficient algorithm and to avoid memory leaks.

AIZU p01111 Skyscraper MinatoHarukas

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input format is not very clear. It is not clear what the `b` in the input represents. It is also not clear what the output should be.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the budget is not divisible by the rent of the first floor.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the budget is 0.
* The algorithm is not very efficient. It takes O(n) time to find the maximum number of floors that can be rented for a given budget.
* The algorithm does not take into account the fact that the rent for a floor may be more than the rent for the previous floor. This could lead to an incorrect answer.

Here are some possible solutions to these problems:

* The input format could be improved by making it more clear what the `b` in the input represents. For example, the input could be in the form of `budget floor_number`.
* The problem statement could be improved by specifying what to do if the budget is not divisible by the rent of the first floor. For example, the problem statement could say that the budget should be rounded down to the nearest multiple of the rent of the first floor.
* The problem statement could be improved by specifying what to do if the budget is 0. For example, the problem statement could say that the output should be `0 0`.
* The algorithm could be improved by using a binary search to find the maximum number of floors that can be rented for a given budget. This would reduce the running time to O(log n).
* The algorithm could be improved by taking into account the fact that the rent for a floor may be more than the rent for the previous floor. This could be done by using a priority queue to keep track of the floors that have the highest rent-to-floor ratio.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correct. For example, the input format is "N A1 B1 ... AN BN", but the input is "N A1 B1 ... AN BN C".
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input is not correct. For example, the input is "1 2 3 4", but the data type of "1" is string, not integer.
3. **Incorrect range**. The input value is out of range. For example, the input is "N -1 0", but N should be an integer greater than or equal to 1.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may forget to add 1 to the answer. For example, the correct answer is 10, but the developer outputs 9.
5. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the developer may use a greedy algorithm to solve the problem, but the problem requires a dynamic programming algorithm.
6. **Runtime error**. The developer's code may have a runtime error. For example, the developer may use an infinite loop in their code.
7. **Memory error**. The developer's code may use too much memory. For example, the developer may create a large array in their code.
8. **Incorrect output format**. The developer's code may output the wrong format. For example, the developer may output the answer in a different format than the expected format.

AIZU p01726 Almost Same Substring

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input variables `S` and `T'` are given as strings, but the developer may accidentally treat them as integers. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator**. The problem statement specifies that `T` and `T'` differ by exactly one character. The developer may accidentally use the wrong comparison operator, such as `==` or `!=`, which would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The problem statement specifies that the substring must be of length `|T'|`. The developer may accidentally include or exclude the first or last character of the substring, which would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect loop termination condition**. The developer may forget to terminate the loop when the substring is no longer valid, which would cause the program to run indefinitely or produce incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect use of `count()`**. The `count()` method returns the number of occurrences of a substring in a string. The developer may accidentally use `count()` to find the number of characters that differ between `S` and `T'`, which would cause the program to produce incorrect results.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully read the problem statement and make sure to understand the input and output formats. The developer should also carefully check their code for errors, such as incorrect variable types, incorrect comparison operators, off-by-one errors, and incorrect loop termination conditions. Finally, the developer should test their code with a variety of input values to make sure that it produces the correct results.

AIZU p02145 Shiritori

Pain points:
s
o
r **Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrectly implementing the rules of shiritori.** The rules of shiritori are fairly simple, but it's easy to make a mistake when implementing them in code. For example, you might forget to check that the last character of the previously selected string is the first character of the next string, or you might not correctly handle the case where there are no more strings to select from.
* **Using an incorrect data structure.** The input to this problem is a list of strings, so you'll need to use a data structure that can store and efficiently access strings. A simple list or array would work, but you could also use a more specialized data structure such as a hash table or trie.
* **Not handling errors correctly.** The input to this problem could contain invalid data, such as a string that contains non-alphabetic characters. You'll need to make sure to handle these errors gracefully so that your program doesn't crash.
* **Not using efficient algorithms.** The input to this problem could be very large, so it's important to use efficient algorithms to solve it. For example, you could use a binary search to find the last character of the last selected string, or you could use a hash table to store the strings in the input.

**Here are some specific bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:**

* **A bug where the last character of the last selected string is not correctly identified.** This could happen if the developer incorrectly implements the rules of shiritori or if they use an incorrect data structure.
* **A bug where the output of the program is incorrect.** This could happen if the developer incorrectly handles errors or if they use inefficient algorithms.
* **A bug where the program crashes.** This could happen if the developer incorrectly handles invalid input or if they use a data structure that is not properly initialized.

Title:
AIZU p02286 Treap

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect implementation of the Treap data structure.** The Treap data structure is a binary tree with two additional properties: the binary-search-tree property and the heap property. The developer must ensure that both of these properties are maintained correctly in their implementation.
* **Incorrect implementation of the insert, find, and delete operations.** The developer must ensure that these operations are implemented correctly in order to maintain the Treap data structure.
* **Incorrect implementation of the inorder and preorder tree walks.** The developer must ensure that these tree walks are implemented correctly in order to print the keys of the Treap in the correct order.
* **Incorrect handling of errors.** The developer must handle errors that may occur during the execution of the program, such as invalid input or out-of-memory errors.

**Additional tips:**

* The Treap data structure can be implemented using a doubly linked list. This implementation will make it easier to maintain the binary-search-tree and heap properties.
* The insert, find, and delete operations can be implemented using recursion. This will make the code more concise and easier to read.
* The inorder and preorder tree walks can be implemented using a stack. This will make it easier to traverse the Treap in the correct order.
* The developer should test their program thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. This can be done by using a variety of test cases, including both valid and invalid input.

AIZU p02433 List

Pain points:
2
1 ```
1. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating through the list, it is easy to make a mistake and miss an element or count an element twice. This can be avoided by using a sentinel value to mark the end of the list and by checking the index before and after each operation.
2. **Indexing errors.** When inserting or deleting elements from the list, it is important to keep track of the indices of the elements. If an element is inserted at the wrong index, it can throw off the rest of the list and cause errors.
3. **Memory leaks.** When creating new elements for the list, it is important to delete them when they are no longer needed. Otherwise, the list will eventually run out of memory and crash.
4. **Invalid operations.** The list operations have certain constraints, such as not being able to move the cursor past the end of the list or erase an element that doesn't exist. It is important to check for these conditions before performing an operation, otherwise the program may crash or produce incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect output.** When printing the list, it is important to make sure that the elements are printed in the correct order. This can be done by using a stack or queue to keep track of the elements as they are processed.
```
Test inputs:
1. **Off-by-one errors.**

```
q = int(input())

list1 = []
for _ in range(q):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 0:
        list1.insert(b, 1)
    elif a == 1:
        list1.pop(b)
    elif a == 2:
        print(list1[b])
```

This code will produce an error because the `list1.insert()` function inserts the element at the *index* `b`, not the *position* `b`. This means that if `b` is greater than the length of the list, the element will be inserted at the end of the list. For example, if `q = 5`, `list1 = []`, and `a = 0, b = 5`, the element will be inserted at the end of the list, even though `b` is greater than the length of the list.

To fix this error, we can use the `list1.append()` function to insert the element at the end of the list.

```
q = int(input())

list1 = []
for _ in range(q):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 0:
        list1.append(b)
    elif a == 1:
        list1.pop(b)
    elif a == 2:
        print(list1[b])
```

This code will now correctly insert the element at the position `b`.

2. **Indexing errors.**

```
q = int(input())

list1 = []
for _ in range(q):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 0:
        list1.insert(b, 1)
    elif a == 1:
        list1.pop(b)
    elif a == 2:
        print(list1[b])
```

This code will produce an error because the `list1[b]` expression will throw an `IndexError` exception if `b` is greater than the length of the list. To fix this error, we can use the `list1.index()` function to check if the element at index `b` exists. If the element does not exist, we can print `None` instead of the element.

```
q = int(input())

list1 = []
for _ in range(q):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 0:
        list1.append(b)
    elif a == 1:
        list1.pop(b)
    elif a == 2:
        if b < len(list1):
            print(list1[b])
        else:
            print('None')
```

This code will now correctly print `None` if the element at index `b` does not exist.

3. **Memory leaks.**

```
q = int(input())

list1 = []
for _ in range(q):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 0:
        list1.insert(b, 1)
    elif a == 1:
        list1.pop(b)
    elif a == 2:
        print(list1[b])
```

This code will produce a memory leak because the `list1` list is never cleared. To fix this, we can add a `del list1` statement at the end of the program.

```
q = int(input())

list1 = []
for _ in range(q):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 0:
        list1.insert(b, 1)
    elif a == 1:
        list1.pop(b)
    elif a == 2:
        print(list1[b])

del list1
```

This code will now correctly free up the memory used by the `list1` list.

4. **Invalid operations.**

```
q = int(input())

list1 = []
for _ in range(q):
    a, b = map(int,
