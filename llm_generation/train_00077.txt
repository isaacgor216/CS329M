Title:
CODECHEF gdog

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not clear.**

The input format is not clear. It is not clear how many test cases there are, and it is not clear what the format of each test case is. This could lead to the developer misinterpreting the input and making a mistake.

**2. The output format is not clear.**

The output format is not clear. It is not clear how many numbers should be in the output, and it is not clear what the format of each number is. This could lead to the developer misinterpreting the output and making a mistake.

**3. The problem is not well-defined.**

The problem is not well-defined. It is not clear what the goal of the problem is, and it is not clear what the constraints are. This could lead to the developer making assumptions about the problem that are not correct, and making a mistake.

Title:
CODECHEF m3

Pain points:
```
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line of each test case should contain a number N, which is the number of teams in the league. However, if the input format is incorrect, such as if the first line of a test case does not contain a number, then the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data**. The input data specifies that if i != j, then aij + aji = 1 or aij = aji = 2. However, if the input data does not satisfy this condition, then the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program should determine if a specific team still has a chance of winning the league. However, if the logic is incorrect, then the program may output the wrong answer.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the program should print a binary string of length N, in which the i-th character is 1 if the i-th team still has a chance to be a champion of the league, and 0 otherwise. However, if the output format is incorrect, such as if the program prints a string of length N+1, then the program will receive a negative score.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The variable `N` should be an integer, but it is declared as a string. This will cause a `TypeError`.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator**. The condition `N < M` is incorrect. It should be `N > M`.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code should find the index of the knight sitting opposite to the knight numbered `M`. However, the code is currently finding the index of the knight sitting next to the knight numbered `M`.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The code is returning the index of the knight sitting opposite to the knight numbered `M` - 1. This is incorrect because the knight numbered `M` is sitting opposite to the knight numbered `M` + 1.
5. **Incorrect output format**. The code is not outputting the answer in the correct format. The answer should be a single integer, but the code is outputting a string.

CODEFORCES 1013_A. Piles With Stones

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format specified in the problem statement is:

```
The first line of the input file contains a single integer n, the number of piles with stones in the garden (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The second line contains n integers separated by spaces x_1, x_2, …, x_n, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the first time (0 ≤ x_i ≤ 1000).

The third line contains n integers separated by spaces y_1, y_2, …, y_n, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the second time (0 ≤ y_i ≤ 1000).
```

A developer may incorrectly parse the input and get an incorrect result. For example, if the input is `5 1 2 3 4 5 2 1 4 3 5`, the developer may incorrectly parse the input as `5 1 2 3 4 5 2 1 4 3 5 6` and get an incorrect result.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format specified in the problem statement is:

```
If the records can be consistent output "Yes", otherwise output "No" (quotes for clarity).
```

A developer may incorrectly format the output and get an incorrect result. For example, if the correct output is `Yes`, the developer may incorrectly output `yes` and get an incorrect result.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic for solving this problem is as follows:

1. Iterate through the piles and calculate the total number of stones in the first list.
2. Iterate through the piles and calculate the total number of stones in the second list.
3. If the total number of stones in the first list is equal to the total number of stones in the second list, then the records can be consistent. Otherwise, the records cannot be consistent.

A developer may incorrectly implement this logic and get an incorrect result. For example, the developer may forget to initialize the total number of stones in the first list or the second list, or the developer may incorrectly calculate the total number of stones in one of the lists.

**4. Runtime errors**

The developer may incorrectly implement the logic for solving this problem and cause a runtime error. For example, the developer may try to divide by zero or access an array element that is out of bounds.

**5. Memory errors**

The developer may incorrectly allocate memory for the data structures used to solve this problem and cause a memory error. For example, the developer may allocate too much memory or not enough memory.
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect input format**

Title:
CODEFORCES 1037_G. A Game on Strings

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly. For example, if you forget to read the newline character after the first line of input, you will get the wrong answer.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also very specific. You must make sure that you are outputting the answer in the correct format. For example, if you forget to put the newline character after the answer, you will get the wrong answer.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

One common mistake that people make when solving problems like this is to make an off-by-one error. For example, if you are trying to find the index of the last occurrence of a character in a string, you might accidentally start your search at the wrong index. This can lead to the wrong answer.

**4. Undefined behavior**

Another common mistake that people make when solving problems like this is to use undefined behavior. For example, if you are trying to divide by zero, your program will likely crash. This is undefined behavior, and it is not guaranteed to produce the same result on every compiler.

**5. Memory leaks**

It is important to make sure that you are not leaking memory when you are solving problems like this. Memory leaks can cause your program to run out of memory, which can lead to crashes.

**6. Race conditions**

Race conditions can occur when two threads or processes are trying to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even crashes.

**7. Deadlocks**

Deadlocks can occur when two threads or processes are each waiting for the other to release a resource. This can cause your program to hang indefinitely.

**8. Buffer overflows**

Buffer overflows can occur when you write more data to a buffer than it can hold. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, which can be very dangerous.

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain a space between two integers, or a newline character at the end of the input. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the output may contain a space between two integers, or a newline character at the end of the output. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the subrectangle area**. The area of the subrectangle is calculated incorrectly. For example, the area may be calculated as the sum of the elements of the subrectangle, or as the product of the width and height of the subrectangle. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect choice of the subrectangle**. The subrectangle is chosen incorrectly. For example, the subrectangle may not be contained in the matrix, or it may not have the maximum possible area. This can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect handling of overflow**. The problem may involve large integers, which can lead to overflow errors. This can lead to incorrect results.
6. **Incorrect use of dynamic programming**. The problem can be solved using dynamic programming. However, if the dynamic programming table is not initialized correctly, or if the dynamic programming algorithm is not implemented correctly, this can lead to incorrect results.
7. **Incorrect use of memoization**. The problem can be solved using memoization. However, if the memoization table is not initialized correctly, or if the memoization function is not implemented correctly, this can lead to incorrect results.
8. **Incorrect use of divide and conquer**. The problem can be solved using divide and conquer. However, if the problem is not divided into subproblems correctly, or if the subproblems are not solved correctly, this can lead to incorrect results.
9. **Incorrect use of brute force**. The problem can be solved using brute force. However, this approach is not efficient for large inputs. This can lead to incorrect results or timeout errors.
10. **Incorrect use of other algorithms**. The problem can be solved using other algorithms. However, if the algorithm is not implemented correctly, this can lead to incorrect results.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect comparison of strings**. The strings may contain different letters, but they may be equal in the lexicographical order. For example, "ab" is less than "abc", but "Ab" is greater than "ab".
2. **Incorrect handling of case-insensitive comparison**. The problem statement states that the letters' case does not matter, but the code may still compare the strings in a case-sensitive manner.
3. **Incorrect handling of empty strings**. The problem statement does not specify what should happen if one of the strings is empty. The code should handle this case gracefully.
4. **Incorrect handling of invalid input**. The problem statement states that the strings' lengths must be between 1 and 100 inclusive. The code should check for invalid input and exit with an appropriate error message.
5. **Incorrect output format**. The problem statement specifies that the output should be "-1", "1", or "0". The code should make sure that the output is formatted correctly.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format should be two integers, followed by n lines of volunteers' names, followed by m lines of pairs of volunteers who do not get on. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to process the input and will produce an incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer, followed by k lines of the names of the sought team's participants in the lexicographical order. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce the correct output.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The program should be able to identify the volunteers who do not get on and exclude them from the team. The program should also be able to find the maximum number of volunteers who can get along well with each other and add them to the team. If the logic is incorrect, the program will not be able to find the optimal team and will produce an incorrect output.
4. **Memory leaks.** The program should be able to allocate and free memory efficiently. If there are memory leaks, the program may run out of memory and crash.
5. **Timeouts.** The program should be able to solve the problem within the time limit specified by the problem statement. If the program does not finish running within the time limit, it will be considered incorrect.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1170_G. Graph Decomposition

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

When reading input data, you should make sure that the data is in the correct format. For example, if you expect the input to be an integer, but you receive a string, you will get a `ValueError`.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

When iterating over a list or a range, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one element. This can lead to incorrect results.

**3. Indexing errors**

When accessing elements of a list or a dictionary, it is important to make sure that the index is valid. If you try to access an element that does not exist, you will get a `IndexError`.

**4. Key errors**

When accessing a dictionary, it is important to make sure that the key exists. If you try to access a key that does not exist, you will get a `KeyError`.

**5. Undefined variables**

When using a variable that has not been initialized, you will get a `NameError`.

**6. Type errors**

When you try to use a variable of the wrong type, you will get a `TypeError`.

**7. Zero division errors**

When you divide a number by zero, you will get a `ZeroDivisionError`.

**8. Floating point errors**

Floating point numbers are not exact, and sometimes they can lead to unexpected results. For example, the following code will print `1.0` even though `0.1 + 0.2` is not exactly equal to `1.0`:

```
print(0.1 + 0.2)
```

**9. Memory errors**

If you allocate too much memory, you may run out of memory and your program will crash.

**10. Security vulnerabilities**

If you are not careful, your code may be vulnerable to security attacks. For example, if you accept user input without validating it, an attacker could send your code malicious data that could be used to exploit a security vulnerability.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1189_E. Count Pairs

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulo operation.** When calculating (a_i + a_j)(a_i^2 + a_j^2) % p, it is important to perform the modulo operation on each term of the product separately, and then multiply the results. For example, if p = 3 and a_i = 1 and a_j = 2, then (a_i + a_j)(a_i^2 + a_j^2) = (1 + 2)(1^2 + 2^2) = 9, but 9 % 3 = 0, not 1.
2. **Incorrect handling of duplicate elements.** The problem statement guarantees that all elements of the array are different, but it is possible for the input to contain duplicate elements by mistake. If this happens, the solution will not work correctly.
3. **Incorrect handling of negative elements.** The problem statement does not specify whether the elements of the array can be negative, but it is possible for the input to contain negative elements by mistake. If this happens, the solution will not work correctly.
4. **Incorrect handling of prime numbers that are not 2 or 3.** The solution assumes that p is either 2 or 3, but it is possible for the input to contain a prime number that is not 2 or 3. If this happens, the solution will not work correctly.
5. **Incorrect handling of large input values.** The problem statement does not specify a maximum value for n or p, but it is possible for the input to contain large values. If this happens, the solution may run out of memory or time.
6. **Incorrect implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes.** The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a classic algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit. However, there are many different implementations of the Sieve of Eratosthenes, and some of them are more efficient than others. If the wrong implementation is used, the solution will not be as fast as it could be.
7. **Incorrect implementation of the Chinese remainder theorem.** The Chinese remainder theorem is a powerful tool for solving systems of congruences. However, there are many different implementations of the Chinese remainder theorem, and some of them are more efficient than others. If the wrong implementation is used, the solution will not be as fast as it could be.
8. **Incorrect implementation of the modular inverse function.** The modular inverse function is a function that takes an integer a and a prime number p and returns an integer b such that ab ≡ 1 mod p. The modular inverse function is used in many algorithms, including the Chinese remainder theorem. If the wrong implementation of the modular inverse function is used, the solution will not be correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1208_F. Bits And Pieces

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect array traversal order.** The array should be traversed in a way that guarantees that `i < j < k` for all triplets. For example, a naive traversal of the array from left to right will not work, because it is possible that `j < i < k` for some triplets.
2. **Incorrect use of bitwise operators.** The bitwise AND (`&`) and OR (`|`) operators must be used correctly. For example, the expression `a_i | (a_j & a_k)` should be evaluated as `a_i | (a_j & a_k)`, not `(a_i | a_j) & a_k`.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** It is important to make sure that the indices of the elements in the array are correct. For example, if the array has size `n`, the last valid index is `n - 1`, not `n`.
4. **Memory leaks.** It is important to free any allocated memory after it is no longer needed. For example, if you use the `vector` class in C++, you must call the `clear()` method to free the memory used by the vector when you are finished with it.
5. **Incorrect data types.** The data types used to store the elements of the array must be large enough to hold the values of the elements. For example, if the elements of the array are all positive integers, you should use the `int` data type to store them.
6. **Invalid input.** The input data must be valid. For example, the input must not contain any negative numbers or non-integer values.
7. **Unexpected runtime errors.** The program may encounter unexpected runtime errors, such as a segmentation fault or a floating-point exception. These errors can be caused by a variety of factors, such as incorrect code, invalid input data, or hardware problems.
Test inputs:
**Incorrect array traversal order:**
```

        for k in range(j + 1, n):
            max_value = max(max_value, a[i] | (a[j] & a[k]))

print(max_value)
```

**Incorrect use of bitwise operators:**
```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

max_value = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):

CODEFORCES 1227_E. Arson In Berland Forest

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is a 2D array of characters, but the developer may accidentally use a 2D array of integers or strings. This will cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect boundary check**

The developer may forget to check the boundary of the 2D array when accessing its elements. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**3. Off-by-one error**

The developer may accidentally miscalculate the indices of the 2D array when accessing its elements. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**4. Undefined behavior**

The developer may use uninitialized variables or access memory that has not been allocated. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**5. Race condition**

The developer may access shared data from multiple threads without synchronization. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.

**6. Memory leak**

The developer may fail to free memory that has been allocated. This can eventually lead to a memory leak, which can slow down the program or even cause it to crash.

**7. Security vulnerability**

The developer may write code that is vulnerable to attacks such as buffer overflows or SQL injection. This can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or its data.

#### Possible problems and bugs:

1. The input format is not specified clearly. For example, it is not clear whether the day of arrival and the day of departure are separated by a space or a comma. This can lead to errors in parsing the input.
2. The code does not handle the case where there are no scientists from other countries. This can lead to a segmentation fault.
3. The code does not handle the case where two scientists arrive and depart on the same day. This can lead to an incorrect answer.
4. The code does not handle the case where two scientists arrive and depart on different days, but their countries are the same. This can lead to an incorrect answer.
5. The code does not handle the case where two scientists arrive and depart on different days, but their countries are different. This can lead to an incorrect answer.

To avoid these problems, the following steps can be taken:

1. The input format should be specified clearly.
2. The code should handle the case where there are no scientists from other countries.
3. The code should handle the case where two scientists arrive and depart on the same day.
4. The code should handle the case where two scientists arrive and depart on different days, but their countries are the same.
5. The code should handle the case where two scientists arrive and depart on different days, but their countries are different.

CODEFORCES 1292_A. NEKO's Maze Game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is `n, q`, where `n` is the number of rows and `q` is the number of queries. However, if the input format is incorrect, such as `n, q, a`, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem is `Yes` or `No`. However, if the output format is incorrect, such as `yes` or `NO`, the program will also crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program is to check if it is possible to move from cell (1, 1) to cell (2, n) after each query. However, if the logic is incorrect, such as checking if it is possible to move from cell (1, 1) to cell (2, 1), the program will give incorrect answers.
4. **Memory leak**. The program may leak memory if it does not release the memory that it has allocated. This can cause the program to crash or run out of memory.
5. **Timeout**. The program may timeout if it takes too long to run. This can happen if the program is inefficient or if the input is too large.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format, output format, logic, and memory usage of the program. It is also important to test the program with a variety of inputs to make sure that it works correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1312_B. Bogosort

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format of the problem states that the first line of each test case contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of array a. However, a test case may contain a number less than 1 or greater than 100. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format of the problem states that for each test case, the program should print the shuffled version of the array a which is good. However, the program may output an incorrect format, such as printing the original array or printing the array in a different order.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating through the array, the program may accidentally skip or repeat an element. This could cause the program to produce incorrect output.
4. **Array out-of-bounds errors.** The program may try to access an element of the array that does not exist. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
5. **Memory leaks.** The program may not properly free memory that it has allocated. This could eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions.** The program may not be thread-safe, which could lead to incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data simultaneously.
7. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program may not be secure, which could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system.

CODEFORCES 143_C. Help Farmer

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is an integer and the output should be two integers. So we need to use the `int64_t` data type.

```c++
int main() {
    int64_t n;
    cin >> n;
    int64_t a, b, c;
    for (a = 1; a * (b - 2) * (c - 2) <= n; a++) {
        for (b = 2; a * (b - 2) * (c - 2) <= n; b++) {
            for (c = 2; a * (b - 2) * (c - 2) <= n; c++) {
                if (a * b * c == n) {
                    cout << a * b * c - (a - 1) * (b - 2) * (c - 2) << " " << n << endl;
                    return 0;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    cout << -1 << " " << -1 << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**2. Not handling the corner cases**

The input data can be 1, which means that the barn is empty. In this case, the thieves didn't steal any hay blocks.

```c++
int main() {
    int64_t n;
    cin >> n;
    int64_t a, b, c;
    for (a = 1; a * (b - 2) * (c - 2) <= n; a++) {
        for (b = 2; a * (b - 2) * (c - 2) <= n; b++) {
            for (c = 2; a * (b - 2) * (c - 2) <= n; c++) {
                if (a * b * c == n) {
                    cout << a * b * c - (a - 1) * (b - 2) * (c - 2) << " " << n << endl;
                    return 0;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    if (n == 1) {
        cout << 0 << " " << 1 << endl;
    } else {
        cout << -1 << " " << -1 << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**3. Using incorrect formulas**

The formula for the number of hay blocks in the barn is `a * b * c`. The formula for the number of hay blocks stolen by the thieves is `a * b * c - (a - 1) * (b - 2) * (c - 2)`.

```c++
int main() {
    int64_t n;
    cin >> n;
    int64_t a, b, c;
    for (a = 1; a * (b - 2) * (c - 2) <= n; a++) {
        for (b = 2; a * (b - 2) * (c - 2) <= n; b++) {
            for (c = 2; a * (b - 2) * (c - 2) <= n; c++) {
                if (a * b * c == n) {
                    cout << a * b * c - (a - 1) * (b - 1) * (c - 1) << " " << n << endl;
                    return 0;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    if (n == 1) {
        cout << 0 << " " << 1 << endl;

Title:
CODEFORCES 1491_B. Minimal Cost

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is as follows:

```
The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, u and v (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ u, v ≤ 10^9) — the number of rows in the graph and the numbers of coins needed to move vertically and horizontally respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) — where a_i represents that the obstacle in the i-th row is in node (i, a_i).

It's guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 ⋅ 10^4.
```

A common mistake is to forget to include the newline character at the end of each line of input. This can cause the input to be interpreted incorrectly, resulting in a runtime error.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is as follows:

```
For each test case, output a single integer — the minimal number of coins you need to spend to be able to reach node (n, 10^6+1) from node (1, 0) by moving through edges of this graph without passing through obstacles.
```

A common mistake is to output the wrong number of digits. For example, if the correct answer is 10, you might accidentally output 100. This can cause the judge to mark your submission as incorrect.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm you use to solve the problem must be correct. A common mistake is to use an incorrect algorithm, which will result in an incorrect answer.

**4. Runtime error**

A runtime error occurs when your program crashes while it is running. This can be caused by a variety of reasons, such as a division by zero, an array out-of-bounds error, or a stack overflow.

**5. Memory error**

A memory error occurs when your program runs out of memory. This can be caused by a variety of reasons, such as allocating too much memory, or using a data structure that is too large.

**6. Time limit exceeded**

A time limit exceeded error occurs when your program takes too long to run. This can be caused by a variety of reasons, such as using an inefficient algorithm, or using too much recursion.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1513_E. Cost Equilibrium

Pain points:
**Possible problems:**

* The input data may not be valid. For example, the input array may contain negative integers, or the input array may not have the same length as the number of elements in the array.
* The output data may not be correct. For example, the output may be negative, or the output may not be a multiple of 10^9 + 7.
* The code may not be efficient enough. For example, the code may take a long time to run, or the code may use too much memory.
* The code may not be correct. For example, the code may not correctly implement the algorithm, or the code may contain bugs.

**Possible bugs:**

* The code may not correctly handle the edge cases. For example, the code may not correctly handle the case where the input array is empty, or the code may not correctly handle the case where the input array contains all the same elements.
* The code may not correctly implement the algorithm. For example, the code may not correctly calculate the cost of transforming the input array into a beautiful array, or the code may not correctly count the number of balanced permutations.
* The code may contain bugs. For example, the code may use incorrect variables, or the code may have incorrect logic.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1540_D. Inverse Inversions

Pain points:

 1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading it in. For example, you might forget to include a space between two numbers, or you might accidentally put a comma instead of a space. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect array indexing**. When you're working with arrays, it's important to make sure that you're indexing them correctly. For example, if you try to access an element that doesn't exist in the array, the program will crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when you forget to add or subtract one from a number. For example, if you're trying to find the index of the smallest element in an array, you might accidentally start counting from 0 instead of 1. This can lead to the program finding the wrong element.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The logic in your program needs to be correct in order for it to produce the correct output. For example, if you're trying to find the maximum value in an array, you need to make sure that you're comparing all of the elements in the array.
5. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when you allocate memory for a variable but don't free it when you're done with it. This can cause your program to run out of memory and crash.
6. **Synchronization issues**. When you're working with multiple threads, it's important to make sure that they're synchronized properly. Otherwise, you might end up with data corruption or other problems.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. If you're not careful, your program could be vulnerable to security attacks. For example, you might accidentally expose sensitive data to attackers or allow them to execute arbitrary code on your system.

To avoid these problems, it's important to carefully review your code before you run it. You should also use a debugger to help you find any errors that you might have missed.

Title:
CODEFORCES 168_C. Wizards and Trolleybuses

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable types.** The input specifies that `n`, `a`, and `d` are integers, but the code incorrectly treats them as floats. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect use of floating-point arithmetic.** The code uses floating-point arithmetic to calculate the arrival times of the trolleybuses. However, floating-point arithmetic is not always precise, and this can lead to rounding errors. This can lead to incorrect results, or to the code failing to terminate.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** The code incorrectly calculates the arrival times of the trolleybuses. This is because it does not account for the fact that the trolleybuses start at the depot, which is not included in the distance from the depot to the final station. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect use of the `math` library.** The code incorrectly uses the `math` library to calculate the square root of the acceleration. This can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect use of the `pow` function.** The code incorrectly uses the `pow` function to calculate the acceleration. This can lead to incorrect results.
6. **Incorrect use of the `log` function.** The code incorrectly uses the `log` function to calculate the time it takes for the trolleybuses to reach the final station. This can lead to incorrect results.
7. **Incorrect use of the `ceil` function.** The code incorrectly uses the `ceil` function to round the arrival times of the trolleybuses. This can lead to incorrect results.
8. **Incorrect use of the `round` function.** The code incorrectly uses the `round` function to round the arrival times of the trolleybuses. This can lead to incorrect results.
9. **Incorrect use of the `%` operator.** The code incorrectly uses the `%` operator to calculate the remainder of the division of the distance from the depot to the final station by the maximum speed of the trolleybuses. This can lead to incorrect results.
10. **Incorrect use of the `+` operator.** The code incorrectly uses the `+` operator to add the time it takes for the trolleybuses to reach the final station to the time they leave the depot. This can lead to incorrect results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 284_D. Cow Program

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one errors.** The most common bug is to forget to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to incorrect results or infinite loops.
2. **Incorrect boundary conditions.** Make sure to check for boundary conditions, such as when a variable is out of range. This can also lead to incorrect results or infinite loops.
3. **Incorrect data types.** Make sure to use the correct data types for your variables. For example, if you are working with large numbers, you should use a 64-bit integer type instead of a 32-bit integer type. This can prevent overflow errors.
4. **Logical errors.** Make sure your logic is correct. This can be difficult to do, especially for complex programs. One way to check for logical errors is to use a debugger.
5. **Uninitialized variables.** Make sure to initialize all variables before using them. This will prevent undefined behavior.
6. **Memory leaks.** Make sure to free any memory that you allocate. This will prevent your program from running out of memory.
7. **Synchronization errors.** Make sure to synchronize access to shared data between multiple threads. This will prevent data corruption.
8. **Security vulnerabilities.** Make sure your program is secure. This includes protecting against buffer overflows, SQL injection attacks, and other security threats.
Test inputs:
1. **Off-by-one errors:**
```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
for i in range(1, n):
    x = i
    y = 0
    while True:
        x += a[x-1]
        y += a[x-1]
        if x <= 0 or x > n:
            break
    print(y)
```

This program will output the correct answer for all of the test cases in the problem statement. However, it has an off-by-one error in the following case:

```
n = 5
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

In this case, the program will output 15, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 16.

The reason for this error is that the program checks for the boundary condition `x <= 0` before the boundary condition `x > n`. This means that the program will terminate when `x <= 0`, even though `x > n` is also true.

To fix this error, we can swap the order of the two boundary conditions:

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
for i in range(1, n):
    x = i
    y = 0
    while True:
        x += a[x-1]
        y += a[x-1]
        if x > n:
            break
    print(y)
```

This program will now output the correct answer for all of the test cases in the problem statement.

2. **Incorrect boundary conditions:**
```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
for i in range(1, n):
    x = i
    y = 0
    while True:
        x += a[x-1]
        y += a[x-1]
        if x < 0 or x > n:
            break
    print(y)
```

This program will output the correct answer for all of the test cases in the problem statement. However, it has an incorrect boundary condition in the following case:

```
n = 1
a = [1]
```

In this case, the program will output 0, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 1.

The reason for this error is that the program checks for the boundary condition `x < 0` before the boundary condition `x > n`. This means that the program will terminate when `x < 0`, even though `x > n` is also true.

To fix this error, we can swap the order of the two boundary conditions:

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
for i in range(1, n):
    x = i
    y = 0
    while True:
        x += a[x-1]
        y += a[x-1]
        if x > n:
            break
    print(y)
```

This program will now output the correct answer for all of the test cases in the problem statement.

3. **Incorrect data types:**
```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
for i in range(1, n):
    x = i
    y = 0
    while True:
        x += a[x-1]
        y += a[x-1]
        if x < 0 or x > n:
            break
    print(y)
```

This program will output the correct answer for all of the test cases in the problem statement. However, it has an incorrect data type in the following case:

```
n = 1000000000000000000
a = [1]
```

In this case, the program will overflow the integer type and produce incorrect results.

To fix this error, we can use a 64-bit integer type:

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
for i in range(1, n):
    x = i
    y = 0
    while True:
        x += a[x-1]
        y += a[x-1
Title:
CODEFORCES 309_D. Tennis Rackets

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible that the developer will make a mistake when reading the input data. For example, they might forget to add a space between the two numbers, or they might accidentally include a newline character in the input. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the number of triangles**

The developer may also make a mistake when calculating the number of triangles. For example, they might forget to account for the fact that some of the holes are not available for net stretching. Or they might incorrectly calculate the number of possible obtuse triangles. This can also cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is possible that the developer will make a mistake when writing the output data. For example, they might forget to add a newline character at the end of the output, or they might accidentally include a space between the two numbers. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**4. Other bugs**

In addition to the problems listed above, there are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, they might accidentally create a variable with the wrong name, or they might forget to initialize a variable. These kinds of bugs can be difficult to find and fix, so it is important to be careful when writing code.

CODEFORCES 355_B. Vasya and Public Transport

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible that the user will enter data in the wrong format. This can lead to the program crashing or giving incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect data**. The data that the user enters may be incorrect. For example, the number of buses or trolleys may be negative, or the cost of a ticket may be greater than 1000. This can also lead to the program crashing or giving incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating over the data, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one or more elements. This can lead to the program giving incorrect results.
4. **Logic errors**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, leading to incorrect results. For example, the program may not take into account all of the possible ways to buy tickets.
5. **Uncaught exceptions**. The program may not handle exceptions correctly, leading to the program crashing or giving incorrect results.
6. **Memory leaks**. The program may not properly free up memory that it has allocated, leading to the program running out of memory and crashing.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may be vulnerable to security attacks, such as buffer overflows or SQL injection. This can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or to the data that it is processing.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully test the program with a variety of input data. It is also important to use a programming language that has built-in mechanisms for handling errors and memory management.

CODEFORCES 39_J. Spelling Check

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be two strings, each of which consists of lower-case Latin letters. The length of each string is from 1 to 106 symbols inclusive, the first string contains exactly 1 symbol more than the second one. If the input format is incorrect, the program should raise an error.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be two lines. The first line should contain the number of positions of the symbols in the first string, after the deleting of which the first string becomes identical to the second one. The second line should output space-separated positions of these symbols in increasing order. The positions are numbered starting from 1. If it is impossible to make the first string identical to the second string by deleting one symbol, the output should be one number 0. If the output format is incorrect, the program should raise an error.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program should find the position of the symbol in the first string that is not present in the second string and delete it. If there is no such symbol, the program should output 0.
4. **Runtime error**. The program should run in a reasonable amount of time. If the program takes too long to run, it will be considered incorrect.
5. **Memory error**. The program should not use too much memory. If the program uses too much memory, it will be considered incorrect.

CODEFORCES 470_H. Array Sorting

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a single line of space-separated integers. If the input format is incorrect, the program may crash or output incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect algorithm.** There are many different sorting algorithms, and not all of them are efficient. Using an inefficient sorting algorithm can lead to slow runtimes.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating through the array, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one or more elements. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Array out-of-bounds errors.** When accessing elements of the array, it is important to make sure that the index is within the bounds of the array. Otherwise, the program may crash or output incorrect results.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be a single line containing exactly two digits. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer representing the number of good integers. If the output format is incorrect, the program will get a wrong answer.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The program should calculate the number of good integers by considering all possible cases. If the calculation is incorrect, the program will get a wrong answer.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The program should be careful about off-by-one errors. For example, if the input is `89`, the program should count `88` and `89` as good integers, but not `98`.
5. **Memory leaks**. The program should be careful about memory leaks. For example, if the program uses a dynamic array, it should make sure to free the memory when it is no longer needed.
6. **Synchronization issues**. If the program is multi-threaded, it should be careful about synchronization issues. For example, two threads should not access the same shared variable at the same time.
7. **Race conditions**. If the program is multi-threaded, it should be careful about race conditions. For example, a thread should not read the value of a shared variable and then immediately write to it.
8. **Deadlocks**. If the program is multi-threaded, it should be careful about deadlocks. For example, two threads should not wait for each other to release a lock.
9. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program should be careful about security vulnerabilities. For example, the program should not allow users to input arbitrary code.

Title:
CODEFORCES 545_E. Paths and Trees

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**.

The input format for this problem is two integers n and m, followed by m lines of three integers each. Each line represents an edge in the graph, with the first two integers being the vertices that the edge connects and the third integer being the weight of the edge. The last line of the input contains an integer u, which is the starting vertex for the shortest path tree.

If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely produce an incorrect output.

**2. The graph is not connected**.

A connected graph is a graph in which there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex. For this problem, we need to find the shortest-path tree from a given vertex u to every other vertex in the graph. If the graph is not connected, then there will be some vertices that are not reachable from u, and the shortest-path tree will not be able to be constructed.

**3. The shortest-path tree is not unique**.

For a given graph and starting vertex, there may be more than one shortest-path tree. In this case, the program will need to choose one of the possible trees to output. The easiest way to do this is to simply output the tree with the smallest total weight of edges.

**4. The program does not correctly find the shortest-path tree**.

There are a number of ways that the program could fail to correctly find the shortest-path tree. For example, the program could use an incorrect algorithm, or it could make a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm. If the program does not correctly find the shortest-path tree, the output will be incorrect.

**5. The program does not output the correct format**.

The output for this problem should be two lines. The first line should contain the minimum total weight of the edges in the shortest-path tree. The second line should contain the indices of the edges that are included in the tree, separated by spaces. The edges are numbered starting from 1 in the order they follow in the input.

If the program does not output the correct format, the output will be invalid and the judge will not be able to correctly evaluate the solution.

CODEFORCES 730_L. Expression Queries

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly. For example, if you forget to include the newline character at the end of the input string, the program will likely crash.

**2. Malformed expressions**

The input string may contain malformed expressions. For example, it may contain expressions with missing parentheses or expressions with invalid operators. If you encounter a malformed expression, you should return -1.

**3. Incorrect calculation of sub-expression values**

When calculating the value of a sub-expression, you need to be careful to follow the standard operator precedence rules. For example, multiplication should be performed before addition.

**4. Overflow**

The values of sub-expressions can be very large, so it is important to be careful to avoid overflow errors. One way to do this is to use the `long long` data type instead of the `int` data type.

**5. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a list of integers, one per line. Make sure that you are formatting the output correctly.

**6. Runtime errors**

Your program should run in a reasonable amount of time. If your program takes too long to run, it will likely be timed out.

**7. Memory errors**

Your program should not use too much memory. If your program uses too much memory, it will likely be killed by the operating system.

For example, if the program checks if the first word in the second list is in the first list, but the first word in the second list is actually the second word in the first list, the program may give the wrong answer.
5. **Memory leaks.** The program may not free up memory after it is no longer needed, which may lead to memory leaks. This can slow down the program and eventually cause it to crash.
6. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program may contain security vulnerabilities, which may allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or the system. For example, if the program does not properly validate user input, attackers may be able to inject malicious code into the program.

CODEFORCES 776_C. Molly's Chemicals

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain a space between the two integers n and k, or the two integers may be separated by a new line instead of a space.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The input data may not be in the correct data type. For example, the input may contain a string instead of an integer.
3. **Incorrect range.** The input data may not be in the correct range. For example, the number of chemicals n may be negative or greater than 105.
4. **Off-by-one error.** The developer may forget to add 1 to the answer when calculating the number of valid segments.
5. **Incorrect logic.** The developer may implement the incorrect logic to calculate the number of valid segments.
6. **Memory leak.** The developer may not free the memory allocated for the input data after the program is finished running.
7. **Timeout.** The developer's solution may not finish running within the time limit specified by the problem.
8. **Incorrect output format.** The developer's solution may not print the output in the correct format.

Title:
CODEFORCES 7_D. Palindrome Degree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of data types**

When working with strings, it is important to use the correct data type. For example, if you try to store a string in an integer variable, you will get an error.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

When working with arrays, it is important to be careful about off-by-one errors. For example, if you try to access the element at index 10 in an array of size 9, you will get an error.

**3. Undefined behavior**

Undefined behavior occurs when a program does something that is not specified in the language standard. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as dividing by zero or accessing a memory location that is out of bounds. Undefined behavior can lead to unpredictable results, so it is important to avoid it whenever possible.

**4. Memory leaks**

A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

**5. Race conditions**

A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to unpredictable results, such as data corruption or deadlocks.

**6. Deadlocks**

A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, and no thread can progress. This can eventually lead to the program freezing or crashing.

**7. Buffer overflows**

A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes data to a buffer that is not large enough to hold it. This can overwrite adjacent memory locations, which can lead to data corruption or security breaches.

**8. Security vulnerabilities**

Security vulnerabilities can occur when a program is not properly written. This can allow attackers to exploit the program and gain unauthorized access to the system.

**9. Performance problems**

Performance problems can occur when a program is not written efficiently. This can make the program run slowly or use more resources than necessary.

**10. Unmaintainable code**

Unmaintainable code is code that is difficult to read, understand, and modify. This can make it difficult to fix bugs or add new features to the program.

CODEFORCES 821_A. Okabe and Future Gadget Laboratory

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is specified as `n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50)` followed by `n lines containing n space-separated integers`. However, the input may not follow this format. For example, the input may contain more than `n lines` or the `n` may not be an integer between `1` and `50`.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is specified as `"Yes"` or `"No"`. However, the output may not follow this format. For example, the output may contain more than one character or it may not be in all lowercase letters.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the sum of two numbers**. The problem states that a good lab is defined as a lab in which every number not equal to 1 can be expressed as the sum of a number in the same row and a number in the same column. However, the developer may incorrectly calculate the sum of two numbers. For example, the developer may add the two numbers instead of subtracting one from the other.
4. **Incorrect checking of whether the lab is good**. The problem states that a good lab is defined as a lab in which every number not equal to 1 can be expressed as the sum of a number in the same row and a number in the same column. However, the developer may incorrectly check whether the lab is good. For example, the developer may only check that the sum of the numbers in each row and column is equal to the number of rows and columns, respectively.
5. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the developer may incorrectly allocate memory, the developer may use incorrect data types, or the developer may have a logical error in their code.

CODEFORCES 847_A. Union of Doubly Linked Lists

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is a list of integers, but the developer may accidentally use a different data type, such as a string or a float. This will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect index**. The developer may accidentally index the list out of bounds, which will also cause the program to crash.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may accidentally miss one or more elements when iterating over the list, which will result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Logic error**. The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program, such as forgetting to update a variable or using the wrong value. This will also result in an incorrect answer.
5. **Memory leak**. The developer may accidentally create a memory leak, which will cause the program to use up more and more memory until it eventually crashes.
6. **Security vulnerability**. The developer may accidentally introduce a security vulnerability, such as allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input data, use the correct data types, and carefully verify the logic of the program. It is also important to use a memory management tool to check for memory leaks. Finally, it is important to perform security testing to identify any potential security vulnerabilities.

Pain points:
1. The input format is not very clear. It is not obvious that the first line contains the number of problems and the number of teams. It would be better to explicitly state this in the problem statement.
2. The output format is also not very clear. It is not obvious that the output should be "YES" or "NO". It would be better to explicitly state this in the problem statement.
3. The problem is not very well-defined. It is not clear what it means for a problemset to be "interesting". It would be better to give a more precise definition of what the problem is asking.
4. The problem is not very challenging. It can be solved by a simple brute-force algorithm. It would be better to make the problem more challenging by adding some additional constraints.
5. The problem is not very interesting. It does not require any creative thinking or problem-solving skills. It would be better to make the problem more interesting by adding some real-world context or by making it more challenging.

CODEFORCES 893_F. Subtree Minimum Query

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the segment tree.** The segment tree is a data structure that can be used to efficiently answer range queries on a given array. However, if the implementation of the segment tree is incorrect, it may not be able to answer queries correctly. For example, if the segment tree is not properly initialized, it may not be able to answer queries on the first few elements of the array.
2. **Incorrect use of the segment tree.** The segment tree can be used to answer a variety of range queries, but it is important to use the segment tree correctly for the specific type of query being asked. For example, if the query is asking for the minimum value in a range, the segment tree must be initialized with the minimum values of the elements in the array.
3. **Incorrect handling of boundary conditions.** The segment tree is a dynamic data structure, which means that it can be changed as new elements are added to the array. However, it is important to handle boundary conditions correctly when updating the segment tree. For example, if a new element is added to the array at the end, the segment tree must be updated to reflect the addition of the new element.
4. **Incorrect error handling.** The segment tree is a complex data structure, and it is possible for errors to occur during its construction or use. It is important to have proper error handling in place to catch and handle any errors that may occur. For example, if an invalid query is passed to the segment tree, the segment tree should throw an error.
5. **Incorrect performance.** The segment tree is a relatively efficient data structure, but it is important to use the segment tree correctly to achieve good performance. For example, if the segment tree is not properly balanced, it may not be able to answer queries efficiently.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may contain a number with leading zeros or a number that is greater than b.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm may not be correct. For example, the algorithm may not find the maximum possible number that is a permutation of digits of a and is not greater than b.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. The implementation of the algorithm may contain bugs. For example, the implementation may not handle edge cases correctly.
5. **Runtime error**. The algorithm may run into a runtime error. For example, the algorithm may run out of memory or time.
6. **Memory leak**. The algorithm may leak memory.

CODEFORCES 938_D. Buy a Ticket

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type.** The input data is given as a string, but the developer may accidentally parse it as an integer. This would lead to incorrect results.
2. **Off-by-one error.** The developer may forget to add 1 to the index when iterating over the array. This would lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect calculation.** The developer may make a mistake in the calculation of the minimum cost. This would lead to incorrect results.
4. **Memory leak.** The developer may not properly free the memory allocated for the data structures. This could lead to a memory leak.
5. **Synchronization error.** The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data structures. This could lead to incorrect results or data corruption.
6. **Exception handling error.** The developer may not properly handle exceptions. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
7. **Security vulnerability.** The developer may introduce a security vulnerability by not properly validating user input. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully check their code for errors before submitting it. They should also use a debugger to help identify any problems that may be present.

CODEFORCES 963_D. Frequency of String

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain a string that is too long, or it may contain a string that contains non-lowercase English letters. The developer should check the input format carefully and handle any errors that may occur.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correctly followed. For example, the output may contain a number that is not an integer, or it may contain a string that is not a valid substring of the input string. The developer should check the output format carefully and handle any errors that may occur.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm for solving the problem. For example, the algorithm may not always find the minimum length of a substring that contains the given string at least k times. The developer should carefully design and implement an algorithm that is guaranteed to find the correct answer.
4. **Incorrect data structures**. The developer may use incorrect data structures to store the input data or the output data. For example, the developer may use a hash table to store the input data, but this may not be the most efficient data structure for this problem. The developer should carefully choose the data structures that are most appropriate for this problem.
5. **Incorrect runtime**. The developer may implement an algorithm that has a runtime that is too slow. For example, the developer may use a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem, but this may not be the most efficient algorithm. The developer should carefully design and implement an algorithm that has a runtime that is as fast as possible.

Title:
CODEFORCES 990_G. GCD Counting

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format of the problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to put a space between two integers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The problem states that the numbers on the vertices are between 1 and 2\*10^5, but if you accidentally store them as integers, the program will overflow and give incorrect results. It is important to use the correct data type for the numbers, such as long long.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When counting the number of pairs of vertices that satisfy a certain condition, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, if you are counting the number of pairs of vertices whose gcd is 3, you need to make sure that you include the pairs (1, 4) and (2, 3), but not the pair (3, 4).
4. **Incorrect logic.** The logic for solving this problem is not trivial, and it is easy to make a mistake. For example, if you are trying to find the gcd of two numbers, you need to make sure that you check for the case where one of the numbers is zero.
5. **Memory leaks.** When you are working with large data sets, it is important to be aware of memory leaks. A memory leak occurs when you allocate memory for a variable but never free it up when you are done with it. This can lead to your program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Synchronization issues.** If you are working on a multi-threaded program, it is important to be aware of synchronization issues. A synchronization issue occurs when two threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to data corruption and other problems.

Title:
HACKEREARTH aprileasy-the-one-with-the-queries-3

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the input strings**

The input strings are given as a single string and a list of strings, respectively. If these strings are not converted to the correct data type, the program will not be able to correctly process them.

**2. Using an inefficient algorithm**

The naive algorithm for finding if a string is a subsequence of another string is to iterate over the first string and check if each character is present in the second string. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the first string. There are more efficient algorithms that can be used, such as the KMP algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n + m), where n is the length of the first string and m is the length of the second string.

**3. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

When iterating over the strings, it is important to make sure that the indices are within the bounds of the strings. If an index is out of bounds, the program will crash or produce incorrect results.

**4. Not handling special cases correctly**

The input strings may contain special characters, such as spaces or newlines. It is important to make sure that these characters are handled correctly, or the program will not be able to correctly process the input.

**5. Not using error handling**

If there is an error in the input, the program should be able to handle it gracefully. This means that the program should not crash or produce incorrect results. Instead, the program should print an error message and exit.

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type:** The input `N` can be very large, so using an integer data type may cause overflow. We should use a long long data type instead.
2. **Using an incorrect algorithm:** The naive algorithm for finding the maximum area is to consider every possible combination of straws and pick the one with the largest area. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(N^2), which is too slow for large values of `N`.
3. **Not handling edge cases:** The input may contain negative values or zero values. We should handle these cases correctly.
4. **Using incorrect variable names:** The variable names should be descriptive and easy to understand.
5. **Not commenting the code:** The code should be well-commented so that other developers can understand it easily.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem is asking for the minimum number of steps to make each boy have the same number of apples, not the maximum number of steps.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution should iterate over all possible combinations of steps and find the one that minimizes the total number of steps.
3. **Incorrect testing of the solution.** The solution should be tested on a variety of input values to ensure that it works correctly in all cases.
4. **Incorrect documentation of the solution.** The solution should be well-documented so that other developers can understand how it works.
5. **Incorrect deployment of the solution.** The solution should be deployed in a way that is secure and scalable.
6. **Incorrect monitoring of the solution.** The solution should be monitored to ensure that it is working correctly and to identify any potential problems.
7. **Incorrect handling of errors.** The solution should handle errors gracefully and in a way that does not impact the user experience.
8. **Incorrect communication of the solution.** The solution should be communicated to stakeholders in a clear and concise way.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specified in the problem statement is not strictly followed. For example, the input could contain a space between the first two digits of the number N, or it could contain a newline character after the number N.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specified in the problem statement is not strictly followed. For example, the output could contain a space between the two coordinates of a point, or it could contain a newline character after the last point.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the distance between two points**. The distance between two points is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. However, the Pythagorean theorem only applies to right triangles. If the two points are not on a right angle, the distance between them will be calculated incorrectly.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the angle between three points**. The angle between three points is calculated using the law of sines. However, the law of sines only applies to triangles that are not obtuse. If the triangle formed by the three points is obtuse, the angle between them will be calculated incorrectly.
5. **Incorrect choice of the first point**. The first point in the output should have the lowest first coordinate (among all of the points with the lowest second coordinate). However, if there are multiple points with the same first coordinate, the first point could be chosen incorrectly.
6. **Incorrect choice of the highest point**. The highest point in the output should be as low as possible. However, if there are multiple points with the same height, the highest point could be chosen incorrectly.
7. **Incorrect order of the points**. The points in the output should be listed in the order in which they appear in the input. However, if the points are not listed in the correct order, the output will be incorrect.

Title:
HACKEREARTH little-achraf-in-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem is to implement the algorithm incorrectly. This can lead to incorrect results or even a runtime error.

**2. Using incorrect data types**

Another common mistake is to use incorrect data types. For example, if the input is a string, but the developer uses an integer to store the value, this will lead to incorrect results.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that can occur when the developer miscounts or misindexes an array or other data structure. This can lead to incorrect results or even a runtime error.

**4. Using uninitialized variables**

Developers should always initialize variables before using them. If a variable is not initialized, it may contain garbage data, which can lead to incorrect results or even a runtime error.

**5. Not handling errors correctly**

Developers should always handle errors correctly. This means that they should check for errors and take appropriate action if an error occurs. For example, if the input is invalid, the developer should gracefully handle the error and return an appropriate error message.

Title:
HACKEREARTH monks-love-for-food

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable types**. The input is a list of integers, but the code tries to access it as a string. This will cause a `TypeError`.
2. **Incorrect variable names**. The code uses the variable `i` to index the list of integers, but this will cause a `NameError` if the list is empty.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code tries to remove the first element from the list of integers, but this will cause an `IndexError` if the list is empty.
4. **Incorrect output**. The code prints the first element of the list of integers, but this will cause a `ValueError` if the list is empty.
5. **Uncaught exceptions**. The code does not catch any exceptions, so any errors that occur will cause the program to crash.

To avoid these problems, the following steps should be taken:

1. Use the correct variable types. The input should be a list of integers, and the variables should be named appropriately.
2. Use the correct logic. The code should check if the list is empty before trying to remove the first element.
3. Use the correct output. The code should print `"No Food"` if the list is empty.
4. Catch any exceptions that occur. The code should handle any errors that occur gracefully.

Title:
HACKEREARTH power-matrix

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) should be used to ensure that the results of the multiplication are within the range of the matrix elements. For example, if the matrix elements are all positive integers less than 100, then the results of the multiplication should also be positive integers less than 100. However, if the modulo operator is not used, then the results of the multiplication could be negative integers or integers greater than 100.
2. **Incorrect use of the exponentiation operator.** The exponentiation operator (**) should be used to raise the matrix to the power of N. For example, if M is a matrix and N is a positive integer, then M**N should be the matrix that is obtained by multiplying M by itself N times. However, if the exponentiation operator is not used correctly, then the results of the multiplication could be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect use of the matrix multiplication operator.** The matrix multiplication operator (^) should be used to multiply two matrices together. For example, if A and B are two matrices, then A^B should be the matrix that is obtained by multiplying A by B. However, if the matrix multiplication operator is not used correctly, then the results of the multiplication could be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect use of the array indexing operator.** The array indexing operator ([]) should be used to access the elements of a matrix. For example, if M is a matrix and i and j are two integers, then M[i][j] should be the element of M that is in the ith row and jth column. However, if the array indexing operator is not used correctly, then the results of the multiplication could be incorrect.
5. **Incorrect use of the range-based for loop.** The range-based for loop (for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)) should be used to iterate over the elements of a matrix. For example, if M is a matrix and N is the number of rows in M, then the following code would iterate over all of the elements of M:
```
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
  for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
    // Do something with the element M[i][j]
  }
}
```
However, if the range-based for loop is not used correctly, then the results of the multiplication could be incorrect.
6. **Incorrect use of the standard library functions.** The standard library functions should be used to perform common tasks, such as reading input from the console, writing output to the console, and allocating memory. For example, the following code uses the standard library function `cin` to read the number of test cases from the console:
```
int T;
cin >> T;
```
However, if the standard library functions are not used correctly, then the results of the multiplication could be incorrect.

HACKEREARTH sachins-love-letter-a

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect calculation of area of the circular piece of paper.** The area of a circle is given by **πr^2**, where **r** is the radius of the circle.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of ways to cut the circular piece of paper into a rectangle.** The number of ways to cut the circular piece of paper into a rectangle is given by **(2n)!/(n!)^2**, where **n** is the number of sides of the rectangle.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the final answer.** The final answer is the number of ways to cut the circular piece of paper into a rectangle, multiplied by the area of the rectangle.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the number of ways to cut the circular piece of paper into a rectangle, it is important to make sure that the number of sides of the rectangle is one less than the number of sides of the circle.
5. **Using the wrong formula.** There are many different formulas that can be used to calculate the area of a circle or the number of ways to cut a circle into a rectangle. It is important to make sure that you are using the correct formula for the problem you are trying to solve.
6. **Using incorrect data types.** When calculating the area of a circle or the number of ways to cut a circle into a rectangle, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct data types for the values you are entering. For example, if you are entering the radius of the circle as a float, you will need to use the **π** constant as a float as well.
7. **Using incorrect operators.** When calculating the area of a circle or the number of ways to cut a circle into a rectangle, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct operators. For example, if you are multiplying two numbers, you need to use the **∗** operator, not the **+** operator.
8. **Using incorrect parentheses.** When calculating the area of a circle or the number of ways to cut a circle into a rectangle, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct parentheses. For example, if you are adding two numbers, you need to use parentheses around the numbers that you are adding, like this: **(a + b)**.

Title:
HACKEREARTH sum-of-numbers-9

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly using the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of the array.** The `sum()` function sums all of the elements in a list, so if you use it to calculate the sum of an array, you will get the wrong answer. To correctly calculate the sum of an array, you need to use a for loop to iterate through the array and add each element to a running total.
2. **Using the wrong data type for the array.** The array should be a list of integers, so if you use a different data type, you will get the wrong answer.
3. **Using an incorrect comparison operator.** The comparison operator `>` should be used to compare two numbers to see if the first number is greater than the second number. If you use the wrong comparison operator, you will get the wrong answer.
4. **Incorrectly using the `if` statement.** The `if` statement should be used to check if a condition is true. If the condition is true, the code inside the `if` statement will be executed. If the condition is false, the code inside the `if` statement will be skipped.
5. **Incorrectly using the `else` statement.** The `else` statement should be used to execute code if the condition in the `if` statement is false. If the condition in the `if` statement is true, the code inside the `else` statement will be skipped.
6. **Incorrectly using the `print()` function.** The `print()` function should be used to print text to the console. If you use the `print()` function to print a variable, you will get the wrong output.
7. **Incorrectly using the `input()` function.** The `input()` function should be used to get input from the user. If you use the `input()` function to get input from a file, you will get the wrong input.

Title:
HACKEREARTH way-to-follow-on-grid

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. This means that if you divide a number by another number and then take the remainder, the result will always be less than the divisor. For example, if you divide 10 by 3, you get a remainder of 1. This is because 10 is not evenly divisible by 3.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors occur when a programmer accidentally counts one more or one less than they intended. This can lead to incorrect results. For example, if you are supposed to count from 1 to 10, but you accidentally start at 0, you will end up with the wrong answer.
3. **Incorrect use of parentheses.** Parentheses can be used to group expressions together. This can be helpful for making your code more readable and for preventing errors. For example, the expression `(a + b) * c` is different from the expression `a + b * c`. The first expression multiplies `a + b` by `c`, while the second expression adds `a` and `b` and then multiplies the result by `c`.
4. **Incorrect use of variables.** Variables are used to store values in your code. It is important to use variables correctly to avoid errors. For example, if you accidentally use the same variable name for two different things, you will overwrite the value of one variable with the value of the other.
5. **Incorrect use of functions.** Functions are used to group together related code. This can be helpful for making your code more modular and for reusing code. For example, you could write a function to calculate the factorial of a number. This function could then be used in other parts of your code without having to rewrite the same code over and over again.
6. **Incorrect use of data structures.** Data structures are used to store and organize data. It is important to use the correct data structure for your data to avoid errors. For example, if you are storing a list of numbers, you should use a list data structure. If you try to store a list of numbers in a dictionary data structure, you will get an error.

Title:
ATCODER p02615 AtCoder Beginner Contest 173 - Chat in a Circle

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm**

The greedy algorithm for this problem is to always insert the next player into the circle between the two players with the smallest friendliness values. However, if the two players with the smallest friendliness values are adjacent to each other, then this algorithm will not find the optimal solution. For example, if the friendliness values are `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, then the greedy algorithm will insert the player with friendliness 4 between the players with friendliness 1 and 2, resulting in a total comfort of `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`. However, the optimal solution is to insert the player with friendliness 4 between the players with friendliness 2 and 3, resulting in a total comfort of `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`.

**2. Incorrect handling of ties**

The greedy algorithm for this problem assumes that the friendliness values are distinct. However, if the friendliness values are not distinct, then the algorithm may not find the optimal solution. For example, if the friendliness values are `[1, 1, 2, 3]`, then the greedy algorithm will insert the player with friendliness 3 between the players with friendliness 1 and 1, resulting in a total comfort of `1 + 1 + 3 = 5`. However, the optimal solution is to insert the player with friendliness 3 between the players with friendliness 1 and 2, resulting in a total comfort of `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the total comfort**

The total comfort is the sum of the comfort values of all the players. However, the comfort value of a player is not simply the friendliness value of the player. The comfort value of a player is the smaller of the friendliness values of the clockwise adjacent player and the counter-clockwise adjacent player. For example, if the friendliness values are `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, then the comfort values of the players are `[0, 1, 2, 3]`.

**4. Incorrect handling of the first player**

The first player does not get any comfort. However, some implementations of the greedy algorithm may incorrectly add the friendliness value of the first player to the total comfort.

**5. Incorrect handling of the last player**

The last player does not get any comfort. However, some implementations of the greedy algorithm may incorrectly add the friendliness value of the last player to the total comfort.

Title:
ATCODER p02746 Panasonic Programming Contest 2020 - Fractal Shortest Path

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem is asking for the shortest path between two white squares in a fractal. A common mistake is to think that the shortest path is always the one that goes through the center of the fractal. However, this is not always the case. For example, in the following fractal, the shortest path between the two white squares is not the one that goes through the center:

```
    [1]
   [2][3]
  [4][5][6][7]
 [8][9][10][11][12]
```

The correct shortest path is the one that goes through the squares labeled 2 and 7.

2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for finding the shortest path between two white squares in a fractal is relatively simple. However, it is important to implement the algorithm correctly in order to get the correct answer. A common mistake is to make a mistake in the calculation of the distance between two squares. For example, in the following fractal, the distance between the two white squares is not 2, but 3:

```
    [1]
   [2][3]
  [4][5][6][7]
 [8][9][10][11][12]
```

The correct distance is 3, because the two squares are not directly connected.

3. **Incorrect input handling.** The input for this problem is a list of quadruples of integers. A common mistake is to not correctly parse the input. For example, in the following input, the first quadruple is not correctly parsed:

```
2
4 2 7 4
```

The correct input should be:

```
2
4 2
7 4
```

4. **Incorrect output formatting.** The output for this problem is a list of integers. A common mistake is to not correctly format the output. For example, in the following output, the second integer is not correctly formatted:

```
1
25
```

The correct output should be:

```
1
25
```

Title:
ATCODER p03016 AtCoder Beginner Contest 129 - Takahashi's Basics in Education and Learning

Pain points:
### Possible Problems and Bugs ###

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading in the data. For example, if you forget to include a space between two values, the program will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the remainder**. The remainder when a number is divided by another number can be calculated using the following formula:

```
remainder = number % divisor
```

However, it's important to make sure that the divisor is not zero, or the program will throw an error.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating over a range of numbers, it's easy to make a mistake and miss one or more numbers. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect use of variables**. It's important to make sure that variables are used correctly, and that they are initialized with the correct values. Otherwise, the program may produce incorrect results.
5. **Uncaught exceptions**. If an exception is thrown during the execution of the program, it will terminate abruptly. This can make it difficult to debug the problem.

To avoid these problems, it's important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It's also important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it produces the correct results.

Title:
ATCODER p03299 AtCoder Grand Contest 026 - Histogram Coloring

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a list of integers. If you use the wrong data type to store the input data, you may get a runtime error. For example, if you use a list of strings to store the input data, you will get a runtime error when you try to perform arithmetic operations on the input data.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks you to find the number of ways to paint the squares so that the following condition is satisfied:

* Every remaining square is painted either red or blue.
* For all 1 \leq i \leq N-1 and 1 \leq j \leq min(h_i, h_{i+1})-1, there are exactly two squares painted red and two squares painted blue among the following four squares: (i, j), (i, j+1), (i+1, j) and (i+1, j+1).

A naive algorithm to solve this problem is to enumerate all possible ways to paint the squares and count the number of ways that satisfy the given condition. However, this algorithm is very inefficient. For example, if the input data is `[2, 3, 5, 4, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1]`, the naive algorithm will have to enumerate over 2^9 = 512 possible ways to paint the squares.

A more efficient algorithm to solve this problem is to use dynamic programming. Dynamic programming is a technique that can be used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and then solving the subproblems recursively. In this case, we can break the problem down into the following subproblems:

* The number of ways to paint the squares in the first column.
* The number of ways to paint the squares in the second column, given that the squares in the first column are already painted.
* The number of ways to paint the squares in the third column, given that the squares in the first two columns are already painted.
* ...
* The number of ways to paint the squares in the last column, given that the squares in the first N-1 columns are already painted.

Once we have solved all of the subproblems, we can then use the solutions to the subproblems to find the solution to the original problem.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

One common mistake that developers make when solving problems is off-by-one errors. An off-by-one error occurs when you forget to account for the first or last element in a list. For example, if you are trying to find the sum of the first N integers, you need to make sure to include the first integer (N) in the sum.

In this problem, there are a few places where you could make an off-by-one error. For example, you could forget to account for the fact that the first column has only one square. You could also forget to account for the fact that the last column has only one square.

**4. Using incorrect formulas**

Another common mistake that developers make when solving problems is using incorrect formulas. For example, if you are trying to find the area of a circle, you need to use the formula πr^2. If you use the formula πd^2, you will get the wrong answer.

In this problem, there are a few places where you could use incorrect formulas. For example, you could use the wrong formula to calculate the number of ways to paint the squares in a given column. You could also use the wrong formula to calculate the number of ways to paint the squares in a given row.

**5. Not handling edge cases**

Another common mistake that developers make when solving problems is not handling edge cases. An edge case is a situation that is not explicitly mentioned in the problem statement. For example, if the input data is empty, you need to handle that case. You also need to handle the case where the input data is invalid.

In this problem, there are a few edge cases that you need to handle. For example, you need to handle the case where the input data contains a negative number. You also need to handle the case where the input data contains a number that is greater than 10^9.

Title:
ATCODER p03618 AtCoder Grand Contest 019 - Reverse and Compare

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input string can be very long, so it's important to use a data type that can store it without overflowing. In Python, you can use the `str` type for strings.

**2. Not considering all possible cases**

The problem states that you can reverse any substring of the input string, but it doesn't specify what happens if you reverse the entire string. You need to make sure that your code handles this case correctly.

**3. Using inefficient algorithms**

The problem can be solved in O(n) time, but you could accidentally write a solution that takes O(n^2) time or more. Make sure to use an efficient algorithm, such as a dynamic programming solution.

**4. Making mistakes in your code**

It's easy to make mistakes when writing code, especially when the problem is complex. Be careful to check your code for errors before submitting it.

**5. Not testing your code**

It's important to test your code to make sure that it works correctly. You can test your code by running it on a variety of input strings and checking the output.
Test inputs:

Title:
ATCODER p03945 AtCoder Beginner Contest 047 - 1D Reversi

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of data types**

The input string S is of type `string`, but the code tries to use it as a list of characters. This will cause a type error.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

The code iterates over the string S starting at index 1, but the problem statement specifies that the first stone is at index 0. This will cause the code to miss the first stone.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The code assumes that the number of black stones and the number of white stones are equal. This is not always the case, and it will cause the code to give an incorrect answer.

**4. Uncaught exceptions**

The code does not handle the case where the input string is empty. This will cause the code to crash.

**5. Inefficient algorithms**

The code uses a brute-force algorithm to find the minimum number of new stones that Jiro needs to place. This algorithm is very inefficient and will take a long time to run for large input strings.

**6. Insecure code**

The code does not check for input validation. This could allow a malicious user to input invalid data that could crash the code or steal sensitive information.

    if black == white:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(max(black, white))
```

This code will miss the first stone because it iterates over the string S starting at index 1.

**Incorrect logic**

```

    else:
        print(max(black, white))
```

This code assumes that the number of black stones and the number of white stones are equal. This is not always the case, and it will cause the code to give an incorrect answer.

**Uncaught exceptions**

This code uses a brute-force algorithm to find the minimum number of new stones that Jiro needs to place. This algorithm is very inefficient and will take a long time to run for large input strings.

**Insecure code**

```
S = input()

if S == "":
    print(0)
else:
    black = 0
    white = 0
    for i in range(len(S)):
        if S[i] == "B":
            black += 1
        else:

    if black == white:
        print(0)
    else:

Title:
AIZU p00037 Path on a Grid

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**

The input format is specified as follows:

```
The first line is a character string that indicates the presence or absence of the top horizontal line wall as 0 and 1 from the left.
The second line is a character string that indicates the presence or absence of the vertical line wall below it with 0 and 1 from the left.
The third line is a character string that indicates the presence or absence of the wall of the second horizontal line from the top by 0 and 1 from the left.
...
The 9th line is a character string representing the presence or absence of the bottom horizontal line wall with 0 and 1 from the left.
```

However, if the input format is not correct, the program may not work as expected. For example, if the input format is as follows, the program may not work as expected:

```
1111
00001
0110
01011
0010
11111
0010
11001
0111
```

In this case, the first line is correct, but the second line is incorrect because it contains a character other than 0 or 1. As a result, the program may not be able to correctly parse the input and may output an incorrect result.

**2. The program does not handle all possible cases**

The program may not handle all possible cases. For example, the program may not be able to handle the case where the input is a maze with no exit. In this case, the program may not be able to output any output, or it may output an incorrect output.

**3. The program is not efficient**

The program may not be efficient. For example, the program may use a lot of memory or take a long time to run. In this case, the program may not be suitable for use in a production environment.

**4. The program is not secure**

The program may not be secure. For example, the program may allow a malicious user to input arbitrary data, which could be used to exploit security vulnerabilities. In this case, the program may allow a malicious user to gain unauthorized access to the system or to damage the system.

**5. The program does not meet the requirements**

The program may not meet the requirements that have been specified. For example, the program may not be able to output the route in the correct format. In this case, the program may not be able to meet the requirements of the user.

AIZU p00169 Blackjack

Pain points:
* **Incorrectly handling the input data.** The input data may be in a different format than expected, or it may contain invalid data. The developer must ensure that the input data is properly parsed and that any invalid data is handled gracefully.
* **Incorrectly calculating the hand score.** The hand score is calculated by adding the scores of the individual cards. However, the score of a card with a value of 1 may be 1 or 11, and the developer must take this into account when calculating the hand score.
* **Incorrectly handling the case where the hand score exceeds 21.** If the hand score exceeds 21, the hand score is set to 0. The developer must ensure that this case is handled correctly.
* **Incorrectly formatting the output.** The output must be a single line for each dataset, and it must contain the hand score. The developer must ensure that the output is formatted correctly.

By following these tips, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving the Blackjack problem.

AIZU p00497 Nails

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the number of nails on one side of an equilateral triangle is not an integer, or the number of rubber bands is not an integer.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed. For example, the number of nails surrounded by one or more rubber bands is not an integer.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The number of nails surrounded by one or more rubber bands is not calculated correctly. For example, a nail that is not surrounded by any rubber bands is counted as being surrounded by a rubber band.
4. **Memory leak**. The program does not release memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to a system crash.
5. **Race condition**. The program does not protect shared data from being accessed by multiple threads at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results.

AIZU p00682 Area of Polygons

Pain points:
3 1600.0
 **1. The input format is not well-defined.** The input format is not well-defined. For example, it is not clear whether the coordinates of the vertices should be separated by spaces or commas. This can lead to errors in the program's output.
2. **The polygon may not be convex.** The polygon may not be convex, which means that it may have interior angles that are greater than 180 degrees. This can lead to errors in the program's calculation of the area.
3. **The polygon may not be closed.** The polygon may not be closed, which means that it may not have all of its vertices connected. This can lead to errors in the program's calculation of the area.
4. **The polygon may have self-intersections.** The polygon may have self-intersections, which means that it may intersect itself at some point. This can lead to errors in the program's calculation of the area.
5. **The polygon may be degenerate.** The polygon may be degenerate, which means that it may have zero area. This can lead to errors in the program's calculation of the area.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully read the input format and make sure that the program is correctly handling all of the possible cases. The developer should also test the program with a variety of different inputs to make sure that it is producing correct results.

Title:
AIZU p00955 Cover the Polygon with Your Disk

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly specified in the problem statement. A developer may incorrectly assume that the input format is a list of lists, when in fact it is a list of tuples. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the area of the polygon**. The area of a polygon can be calculated using the following formula:

```
A = 1 / 2 * n * s
```

where `n` is the number of sides of the polygon and `s` is the length of the semiperimeter. A developer may incorrectly calculate the area of the polygon, leading to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the distance between two points**. The distance between two points can be calculated using the following formula:

```
d = √(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2
```

where `x1`, `y1` are the coordinates of the first point and `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the second point. A developer may incorrectly calculate the distance between two points, leading to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**. The algorithm for covering a polygon with a disk is not trivial. A developer may incorrectly implement the algorithm, leading to incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. The problem statement does not specify how to handle edge cases, such as when the polygon is a triangle or a square. A developer may incorrectly handle edge cases, leading to incorrect results.
Test inputs:
1. Incorrect input format

Title:
AIZU p01088 500-yen Saving

Pain points:
The following are possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain a negative number, a number that is too large, or a number that is not a whole number.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not always correct. For example, the output may contain a number that is not a whole number, or the output may not be separated by a space.
* **Incorrect calculation:** The developer may make a mistake in the calculation of the maximum number of 500-yen coins that can be collected or the minimum expenses needed to collect that number of 500-yen coins.
* **Incorrect logic:** The developer may use incorrect logic to solve the problem. For example, the developer may assume that the shop always returns the exact change, even if the customer hands over more money than the price of the souvenir.
* **Incorrect implementation:** The developer may implement the solution incorrectly. For example, the developer may use a programming language that is not suited for the problem, or the developer may make a mistake in the code.

To avoid these problems and bugs, the developer should carefully check the input format, output format, and calculation logic. The developer should also carefully implement the solution in a programming language that is suited for the problem.

Title:
AIZU p01224 Perfect Number

Pain points:
abundant number
 * **Incorrect use of the `sum()` function.** The `sum()` function sums the elements of a list, but in this problem, you need to sum the divisors of an integer. To do this, you can use the following formula:

```
sum_of_divisors(n) = n * (1 + math.sqrt(n)) / 2
```

* **Using an incorrect loop condition.** The loop condition in your code should be `n > 1`, not `n > 0`. This is because the number 1 is neither a perfect number, a deficient number, nor an abundant number.

* **Using an incorrect divisor check.** The divisor check in your code should be `n % i == 0`, not `n % i == 1`. This is because a number is divisible by itself, so it should be included in the sum of its divisors.

* **Not handling the case where `n` is a perfect number.** In your code, you only handle the cases where `n` is a deficient number or an abundant number. You need to also handle the case where `n` is a perfect number. To do this, you can check if the sum of the divisors of `n` is equal to `n`.

* **Not handling the case where `n` is 0.** In your code, you do not handle the case where `n` is 0. You need to print `deficient number` for this case.

* **Using an incorrect output format.** Your output should be in the format `"perfect number"`, `"deficient number"`, or `"abundant number"`. You should not include any spaces in your output.

Title:
AIZU p01540 Treasure Hunt

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for coordinates**

The coordinates of the treasures and the regions are given as integers. However, if we use integers to represent the coordinates, we may lose precision and get incorrect results. For example, if we have a treasure at (1000000000, 1000000000) and a region from (999999999, 999999999) to (1000000001, 1000000001), the treasure will not be included in the region even though it is inside the region.

To avoid this problem, we should use a data type that has enough precision to represent the coordinates. For example, we can use floating-point numbers.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm to find the treasures in a region**

The naive algorithm to find the treasures in a region is to iterate over all the treasures and check if each treasure is inside the region. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n * m), where n is the number of treasures and m is the number of regions.

A more efficient algorithm is to use a spatial data structure such as a quadtree or a kd-tree. These data structures can be used to quickly find all the treasures that are inside a region.

**3. Not handling special cases correctly**

The input may contain special cases, such as a region that is empty or a region that contains all the treasures. We need to handle these special cases correctly to avoid getting incorrect results.

**4. Using incorrect variables**

It is important to use the correct variables when writing code. For example, we should not use the same variable to store the number of treasures in a region and the number of treasures in the entire square. This can lead to incorrect results.

**5. Making mistakes in the implementation**

Even the smallest mistake in the implementation can lead to incorrect results. It is important to carefully check the implementation to avoid making mistakes.

**6. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code to make sure that it is correct. This can be done by creating test cases and running the code on the test cases. If the code does not produce the correct results on the test cases, then there is a bug in the code.

AIZU p02410 Matrix Vector Multiplication

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific. Make sure that you read the problem statement carefully and parse the input correctly.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. When computing the product of two matrices, it is important to make sure that you are iterating over the rows and columns in the correct order. A common mistake is to iterate over the rows of the first matrix and the columns of the second matrix in the same order. This will result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Memory errors**. When multiplying two matrices, the resulting matrix can be much larger than either of the input matrices. It is important to make sure that you allocate enough memory for the resulting matrix, or you will get a memory error.
4. **Floating-point errors**. When computing the product of two matrices, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct floating-point arithmetic. Using the wrong arithmetic can result in incorrect answers.
5. **Indexing errors**. When accessing elements of a matrix, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct indices. A common mistake is to index a matrix out of bounds. This will result in an incorrect answer.
6. **Logic errors**. When writing code to solve this problem, it is important to make sure that your logic is correct. A common mistake is to forget to initialize variables or to use the wrong variables. This will result in an incorrect answer.
