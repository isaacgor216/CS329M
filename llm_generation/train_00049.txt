Title:
CODECHEF plzlykme

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect variable type:** The problem statement mentions that `L`, `D`, `S`, and `C` are integers, but the code below uses `float` for all of them. This could lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect comparison:** The problem statement says that the person will survive if they have at least `L` likes by the end of day `D`. However, the code below compares `D2` to `L` instead of `D2` to `L + 1`. This could lead to the person being incorrectly declared dead.
3. **Off-by-one error:** The problem statement says that the person will have `D2 = S + C * S` likes on day `2`. However, the code below calculates `D2 = S * C`. This could lead to the person being incorrectly declared dead.
4. **Incorrect logic:** The problem statement says that the person will survive if they have at least `L` likes by the end of day `D`. However, the code below only checks if the person has at least `L` likes on day `1`. This could lead to the person being incorrectly declared dead.

To avoid these problems, you should make sure to use the correct variable types, make accurate comparisons, and use correct logic. You should also test your code thoroughly to make sure that it produces the correct results.

Title:
CODECHEF subanagr

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type**

When working with strings, it is important to use the correct data type. In Python, strings are represented by the `str` type. If you try to use an incorrect data type, such as `int`, you will get an error.

**2. Forgetting to close files**

When you open a file in Python, it is important to close it when you are finished with it. If you forget to close a file, you may leak memory and cause your program to crash.

**3. Using incorrect comparison operators**

When comparing strings, you must use the correct comparison operators. In Python, the comparison operators `<` and `>` are used to compare numbers. To compare strings, you must use the `<=` and `>=` operators.

**4. Using incorrect string methods**

There are many different string methods available in Python. It is important to use the correct method for the task you are trying to accomplish. For example, the `len()` method returns the length of a string, while the `lower()` method converts a string to lowercase.

**5. Not handling errors correctly**

When working with code, it is important to handle errors correctly. If an error occurs, your program should print an error message and exit gracefully. Do not ignore errors, as this can lead to unexpected behavior.

**6. Using insecure code**

When writing code, it is important to make sure that it is secure. This means that you should protect your code from attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting.

**7. Not testing your code**

Before you deploy your code to production, it is important to test it thoroughly. This will help you to catch any bugs before they cause problems for your users.

CODEFORCES 1266_A. Competitive Programmer

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible that the input contains invalid characters. For example, the input `123a` is invalid because it contains the letter `a`. If the input is invalid, the program should print an error message and exit.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not strictly defined, but it is generally expected that the output should be a single line of text. For example, the output `red` is valid, but the output `red 123` is invalid. If the output is invalid, the program should print an error message and exit.

**3. Insufficient memory**

The program may run out of memory if the input is too large. For example, if the input contains a very long number, the program may not be able to allocate enough memory to store the number. If the program runs out of memory, it will crash.

**4. Incorrect algorithm**

The program may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the program may try to divide a number by 60, but the number is not divisible by 60. If the program uses an incorrect algorithm, it will not produce the correct output.

**5. Runtime errors**

The program may encounter runtime errors, such as division by zero or array out-of-bounds errors. If the program encounters a runtime error, it will crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1307_C. Cow and Message

Pain points:
**1. The input string may contain characters other than lowercase Latin letters.**

To solve this problem, we need to make sure that the input string only contains lowercase Latin letters. We can do this by using the `isalpha()` function in Python. This function takes a string as input and returns True if the string only contains alphabetic characters, and False otherwise.

**2. The input string may be empty.**

To solve this problem, we need to handle the case where the input string is empty. We can do this by checking if the length of the string is 0. If the length of the string is 0, we can simply return 0.

**3. The input string may contain duplicate characters.**

To solve this problem, we need to make sure that we only count each hidden string once. We can do this by using a set to store the hidden strings. A set is a data structure that only stores unique elements. This means that if we add a duplicate element to a set, the element will not be added to the set.

**4. The input string may contain multiple secret messages.**

To solve this problem, we need to find the hidden string that occurs the most times. We can do this by using a dictionary to store the number of occurrences of each hidden string. The key of the dictionary will be the hidden string, and the value will be the number of occurrences of the hidden string.

**5. The output may be incorrect.**

To make sure that the output is correct, we need to check that the number of occurrences of the secret message is a positive integer. We can do this by using the `isdigit()` function in Python. This function takes a string as input and returns True if the string only contains digits, and False otherwise.

**6. The code may be inefficient.**

We can improve the efficiency of our code by using a more efficient data structure to store the hidden strings. We can also use a more efficient algorithm to find the hidden string that occurs the most times.
Test inputs:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <map>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    string s;

    map<string, int> occurrences;

    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < s.length(); j++) {
            string hidden_string = s.substr(i, j - i + 1);
            hidden_strings.insert(hidden_string);
            occurrences[hidden_string]++;
        }
    }

    int max_occurrences = 0;
    string secret_message;

    for (auto hidden_string : hidden_strings) {

Title:
CODEFORCES 1434_E. A Convex Game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly implementing the game rules.** The game rules are quite complex, so it is important to make sure that you understand them correctly before you start coding. For example, one of the rules is that "the picked numbers are v_{i_1}, v_{i_2}, …, v_{i_k}. The following conditions must hold:

  * i_{j} < i_{j+1} for all 1 ≤ j ≤ k-1; 
  * v_{i_{j+1}} - v_{i_j} < v_{i_{j+2}} - v_{i_{j+1}} for all 1 ≤ j ≤ k-2."

If you do not implement this rule correctly, your program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.

2. **Using incorrect data types.** The input data can be quite large, so it is important to use the correct data types to store it. For example, if you try to store the input data as strings, your program will likely run out of memory.

3. **Making a mistake in your algorithm.** The algorithm for solving this problem is quite complex, so it is easy to make a mistake. For example, one common mistake is to forget to check if the current player has any valid moves left.

4. **Not handling all of the possible edge cases.** The input data can contain some edge cases that your program may not be able to handle correctly. For example, the input data may contain a game with no numbers in it.

5. **Not debugging your code thoroughly.** Even if you think your code is correct, it is important to debug it thoroughly before submitting it. This will help you to catch any errors that you may have missed.

```
where `n` and `k` are integers, and `a1`, `a2`, ..., `an` are positive integers. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to process it and will return an error.

2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer, which is the number of lucky subsequences of length `k` in the input sequence. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to process it and will return an error.

3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of lucky subsequences.** The number of lucky subsequences of length `k` in a sequence of length `n` can be calculated using the following formula:
```
C(n, k) * (4^k - 2^k)
```
where `C(n, k)` is the binomial coefficient `n choose k`. If the number of lucky subsequences is calculated incorrectly, the program will return an incorrect answer.

4. **Incorrect modulo operation.** The answer to the problem should be modulo the prime number `1000000007`. If the modulo operation is not performed correctly, the program will return an incorrect answer.

5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:

* **Incorrect variable initialization.** The variables used in the program should be initialized with the correct values. If the variables are not initialized correctly, the program may not work as expected.
* **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program should be correct. If the logic is incorrect, the program may not return the correct answer.
* **Incorrect error handling.** The program should handle errors correctly. If the program does not handle errors correctly, it may crash or return an incorrect answer.

By following these guidelines, you can help to avoid common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

CODEFORCES 162_J. Brackets

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of brackets.** The most common mistake is to use the wrong type of bracket. For example, using a square bracket instead of a round bracket.
2. **Mismatched brackets.** Another common mistake is to have unmatched brackets. For example, starting a bracket without closing it, or closing a bracket without opening it.
3. **Incorrect nesting of brackets.** The order of brackets is important. For example, you cannot close a bracket that has not been opened yet.
4. **Unbalanced brackets.** The number of opening and closing brackets must be equal. For example, you cannot have more opening brackets than closing brackets, or vice versa.
5. **Extraneous characters.** The input string should only contain brackets. Any other characters will be considered errors.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

* Use a bracket checker to help you identify errors.
* Make sure you understand the rules for using brackets.
* Practice using brackets until you are confident in your ability to use them correctly.
* Be careful not to make any mistakes when typing in your code.

Title:
CODEFORCES 183_A. Headquarters

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input may not be formatted correctly. For example, the input may contain extra spaces or tabs, or it may not be terminated with a newline character.
* The input may contain invalid data. For example, the input may contain a string that is not one of the allowed movements, or it may contain a negative number.
* The output may not be formatted correctly. For example, the output may not be terminated with a newline character, or it may contain extra spaces or tabs.
* The program may not be able to handle large inputs. For example, the program may run out of memory or time when trying to process a large input.
* The program may not be able to find the correct answer. For example, the program may output the wrong number of possible locations for the gang headquarters.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems and bugs:

* Use the `cin` and `cout` streams to read and write input and output. This will help you avoid problems with formatting.
* Use the `assert` macro to check for invalid input data. This will help you catch errors early in the development process.
* Use the `std::vector` class to store the possible locations of the gang headquarters. This will help you avoid problems with memory management.
* Use a recursive algorithm to find the possible locations of the gang headquarters. This will help you avoid problems with time complexity.
* Test your program with a variety of inputs to make sure that it is working correctly.

CODEFORCES 207_A3. Beaver's Calculator 1.0

Pain points:
* **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program will crash.
* **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values must be correctly specified. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program will crash.
* **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating through a list or array, it is easy to make an off-by-one error, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if you iterate through a list of numbers from 0 to 9, but forget to include the number 9, the results will be incorrect.
* **Indexing errors**. When accessing elements of a list or array, it is easy to make an indexing error, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if you try to access the element at index 10 of a list that only has 9 elements, the program will crash.
* **Arithmetic errors**. When performing arithmetic operations, it is easy to make a mistake, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if you divide two numbers and forget to round the result, the results will be incorrect.
* **Logical errors**. When writing logical code, it is easy to make a mistake, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if you write an if statement that checks for the wrong condition, the program will not behave as expected.
* **Memory errors**. When allocating memory for a program, it is easy to make a mistake, which can lead to the program crashing. For example, if you allocate too much memory, the program will crash.
* **Synchronization errors**. When multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is easy to make a synchronization error, which can lead to incorrect results or even a deadlock. For example, if two threads are both trying to write to the same variable at the same time, the results will be incorrect.

Title:
CODEFORCES 230_B. T-primes

Pain points:
1. **Using the wrong data type.** The input integers are up to 1012, so they need to be represented using the `long long` data type. Using the `int` data type will cause overflow errors.
2. **Using the wrong specifier to read or write 64-bit integers.** The `%lld` specifier is used to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. Using the `%d` or `%i` specifiers will cause truncation errors.
3. **Not checking for edge cases.** The input may contain 0 or 1, which are not T-primes. The output should be `NO` for these cases.
4. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** The naive algorithm for checking if a number is T-prime is to find all of its divisors. This is an O(n) algorithm, where n is the number of divisors. A more efficient algorithm is to use the following property: a number is T-prime if and only if it is divisible by 4 and not by 3.
5. **Not handling errors correctly.** The `cin` and `cout` streams can throw errors if the input or output is invalid. The code should be written to handle these errors gracefully.

CODEFORCES 396_B. On Sum of Fractions

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given integer. It works by iteratively marking all multiples of each prime number as composite. However, if the implementation is not careful, it is possible to miss some prime numbers. For example, if the implementation starts by marking 2 as prime, then it will miss all of the even numbers that are greater than 2.
2. **Incorrect handling of negative numbers.** The problem statement does not specify whether the input numbers can be negative. If the implementation does not handle negative numbers correctly, it may produce incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect handling of zero.** The problem statement does not specify whether the input numbers can be zero. If the implementation does not handle zero correctly, it may produce incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect handling of infinity.** The problem statement does not specify whether the input numbers can be infinity. If the implementation does not handle infinity correctly, it may produce incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect handling of floating-point numbers.** The problem statement does not specify whether the input numbers can be floating-point numbers. If the implementation does not handle floating-point numbers correctly, it may produce incorrect results.
6. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The problem statement does not specify whether the input numbers can overflow. If the implementation does not handle overflow correctly, it may produce incorrect results.
7. **Incorrect handling of division by zero.** The problem statement does not specify whether the input numbers can be divided by zero. If the implementation does not handle division by zero correctly, it may produce incorrect results.
8. **Incorrect handling of invalid input.** The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input is invalid. If the implementation does not handle invalid input correctly, it may produce incorrect results or crash.
9. **Incorrect use of global variables.** Global variables can be a source of bugs if they are not used correctly. For example, if a global variable is used to store the state of the program, it is possible for one part of the program to overwrite the state that was set by another part of the program. This can lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.
10. **Incorrect use of pointers.** Pointers can be a source of bugs if they are not used correctly. For example, if a pointer is used to access memory that has not been allocated, it is possible for the program to crash.
11. **Incorrect use of arrays.** Arrays can be a source of bugs if they are not used correctly. For example, if an array is used to store more elements than it was allocated to store, it is possible for the program to crash.
12. **Incorrect use of functions.** Functions can be a source of bugs if they are not used correctly. For example, if a function is called with the wrong number of arguments, it is possible for the program to crash.
13. **Incorrect use of data structures.** Data structures can be a source of bugs if they are not used correctly. For example, if a data structure is used to store elements in the wrong order, it is possible for the program to produce incorrect results.
14. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** Algorithms can be a source of bugs if they are not used correctly. For example, if an algorithm is used to solve a problem that it is not designed to solve, it is possible for the program to produce incorrect results.
15. **Incorrect use of libraries.** Libraries can be a source of bugs if they are not used correctly. For example, if a library is used to perform a calculation that it is not designed to perform, it is possible for the program to produce incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data should be two integers. If the input data is not of the correct type, the program will not be able to process it and will throw an error.
3. **Malformed input data**. The input data should be two integers that are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100. If the input data is malformed, the program will not be able to process it and will throw an error.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a table of size `n` x `m` with each row containing `m` integers separated by a space. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will throw an error.
5. **Incorrect output data**. The output data should be a table of positive integers that are less than or equal to 108. If the output data is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will throw an error.
6. **Incorrect logic**. The program should be able to generate a table of size `n` x `m` with each row containing `m` integers separated by a space such that the sum of the squares of the numbers in each row and each column is also a square. If the logic of the program is incorrect, it will not be able to generate the correct output and will throw an error.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format, data type, and malformed input data. The output format and data should also be carefully checked to ensure that they are correct. The logic of the program should be carefully tested to ensure that it is able to generate the correct output.

CODEFORCES 467_B. Fedor and New Game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be three integers n, m, k, followed by m+1 integers xi. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data should be integers. If the input data is not integers, the program will crash.
3. **Off-by-one error**. When counting the number of Fedor's potential friends, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, if k = 1 and xi = 100, then the number of Fedor's potential friends is 101, not 100.
4. **Arithmetic overflow**. When calculating the number of Fedor's potential friends, it is easy to cause an arithmetic overflow. For example, if n = 20 and m = 1000, then the number of Fedor's potential friends is 2^20 * 1000, which is greater than the maximum integer value.
5. **Memory leak**. If the program does not release the memory it allocated, it will cause a memory leak. This can lead to the program crashing or running out of memory.
6. **Race condition**. If two threads access the same data at the same time, it can lead to a race condition. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
7. **Deadlock**. If two threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, it can lead to a deadlock. This can cause the program to hang or crash.
8. **Security vulnerability**. If the program does not properly check the input data, it can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system.

CODEFORCES 48_E. Ivan the Fool VS Gorynych the Dragon

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly and in the correct order. For example, if you were to read the input as h, t, R, n, m instead of h, t, R, n, m, you would get the wrong answer.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem also has a very specific format. It is important to make sure that you are printing the output correctly. For example, if you were to print "Ivan" instead of "Ivan", you would get the wrong answer.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm that you use to solve this problem is very important. If you use an incorrect algorithm, you will get the wrong answer. For example, if you were to use an algorithm that always cuts off the same number of heads and tails, you would not be able to win the game.

**4. Incorrect data structures**

The data structures that you use to solve this problem are also very important. If you use incorrect data structures, you will not be able to store the data correctly and you will get the wrong answer. For example, if you were to use a linked list to store the data, you would not be able to access the data quickly enough and you would get the wrong answer.

**5. Incorrect implementation**

The implementation of your algorithm is also very important. If you implement your algorithm incorrectly, you will not be able to solve the problem correctly. For example, if you were to use a for loop to iterate over the data, you would not be able to iterate over the data correctly and you would get the wrong answer.

CODEFORCES 513_F2. Scaygerboss

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong data type. For example, a string may be interpreted as an integer, or an integer may be interpreted as a float. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating over a list or array, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one element or include one element twice. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The program may contain logical errors that cause it to produce incorrect output. For example, the program may not correctly account for all possible cases or may make assumptions about the input data that are not always true.
5. **Infinite loops**. The program may enter an infinite loop if it does not have any way to terminate. This can happen if the program is not properly designed or if there is a bug in the code.
6. **Memory leaks**. The program may leak memory if it does not properly free up memory that it has allocated. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may contain security vulnerabilities that allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system. This can happen if the program does not properly validate input data or if it uses insecure coding practices.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully review the input format, data types, and logic of the program. It is also important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it produces the correct output for all possible inputs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 53_C. Little Frog

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a single line containing a number n. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to parse the input and will throw an error.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a list of n integers pi (1 ≤ pi ≤ n) which are the frog's route plan. The integers in the list should be separated by a space. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will get a runtime error.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The program should find a route plan for the frog that satisfies the following conditions:
    * All the pi's should be mutually different.
    * All the |pi–pi + 1|'s should be mutually different (1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1).
    If the program's logic is incorrect, it will not be able to find a valid route plan and will output an incorrect solution.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** When computing the values of pi, it is important to make sure that you are not off by one. For example, if n = 3, then the correct route plan is 1, 3, 2. If you accidentally add one to each of the values in the route plan, you will get 2, 4, 3, which is not a valid route plan.
5. **Memory leaks.** The program should be careful not to leak memory. This can be done by using the `delete` keyword to delete objects that are no longer needed.
6. **Synchronization issues.** If the program is multi-threaded, it is important to make sure that the threads are synchronized properly. This can be done by using locks or mutexes.
7. **Race conditions.** If the program is multi-threaded, it is important to make sure that there are no race conditions. This can be done by ensuring that only one thread is accessing a shared resource at a time.
8. **Deadlocks.** If the program is multi-threaded, it is important to make sure that there are no deadlocks. This can be done by ensuring that no thread ever waits for itself to release a lock.
9. **Livelocks.** If the program is multi-threaded, it is important to make sure that there are no livelocks. This can be done by ensuring that no thread ever enters a loop where it is constantly waiting for another thread to do something.
10. **Uncaught exceptions.** The program should catch all uncaught exceptions and handle them gracefully. This can be done by using the `try`-`catch` statement.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is "1\n2 3 4 5", the program will try to read the number of segments as "1", but the next line contains four integers, which will cause an error.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is not correctly converted to the correct data type, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is "1\n2 3 4 5", the program will try to convert the number of segments to an integer, but the input is actually a string, which will cause an error.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem is incorrect, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, a naive algorithm that counts the number of cells painted by each segment and then adds them up will not work correctly if there are overlapping segments.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. The program is not correctly implemented, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program uses a variable to store the number of cells painted, but the variable is not initialized, the program will not work correctly.
5. **Incorrect testing**. The program is not tested correctly, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may be tested on a small set of inputs that do not contain all of the possible errors, which can lead to the program being incorrectly certified as correct.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. The input data should be correctly parsed and converted to the correct data type. The algorithm used to solve the problem should be correct and efficient.

CODEFORCES 771_E. Bear and Rectangle Strips

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input format specifies that the number of columns in the grid is an integer. However, the code below reads the input as a string and then tries to convert it to an integer. This will fail if the input is not a valid integer.

```
n = input()
n = int(n)
```

The correct way to read the input is to use the `int()` function directly.

```
n = int(input())
```

**2. Off-by-one error**

The code below calculates the sum of the numbers in the first row of the grid and then subtracts it from the sum of the numbers in the second row. However, this will not give the correct answer because the first and second rows are not disjoint. To get the correct answer, we need to add the sum of the numbers in the first row to the sum of the numbers in the second row.

```
s1 = sum(map(int, input().split()))
s2 = sum(map(int, input().split()))
print(s1 + s2)
```

The correct code is below.

```
s1 = sum(map(int, input().split()))
s2 = sum(map(int, input().split()))
print(abs(s1 - s2))
```

**3. Undefined variable**

The code below tries to print the value of the variable `s` before it has been assigned a value. This will cause a `NameError`.

```
print(s)
```

The correct code is below.

```
s = sum(map(int, input().split()))
print(s)
```

**4. Index out of range**

The code below tries to access the element at index `n` in the list `a`. However, the list only has `n - 1` elements, so this will cause an `IndexError`.

```
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(a[n])
```

The correct code is below.

```
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

6. The tests are not clear. It is not clear what the tests are testing.
7. The documentation is not clear. It is not clear what the documentation is for.

Here are some possible solutions to these problems:

**1. The input format can be made clearer by using a more precise description of the data types.** For example, the number of questions could be specified as an integer, the maximum number of times the girl can glance could be specified as an integer, and the maximum number of consecutive questions that can be looked at in one time glancing could be specified as an integer.
2. The output format can be made clearer by using a more precise description of the data type. For example, the maximum number of questions the girl can answer correctly could be specified as an integer.
3. The problem statement can be made clearer by providing more details about what the girl is trying to do. For example, the girl is trying to cheat on her Physics final exam by glancing at the answer sheets of the two geniuses sitting next to her.
4. The solution can be made clearer by providing more details about how it works. For example, the solution works by first sorting the questions in the two answer sheets in ascending order. Then, the girl glances at the answer sheets one at a time, starting with the first question in the first answer sheet. If the question is answered correctly, the girl adds it to her answer sheet. If the question is not answered correctly, the girl skips it. The girl continues glancing at the answer sheets until she has glanced at a total of p questions.
5. The code can be made clearer by using more descriptive variable names and comments. For example, the variable `n` could be renamed to `num_questions`, the variable `p` could be renamed to `max_glances`, and the variable `k` could be renamed to `max_consecutive_questions`. The code could also be commented to explain what each line of code does.
6. The tests can be made clearer by providing more details about what they are testing. For example, the tests could test that the solution correctly answers a certain number of questions when given a certain input.
7. The documentation can be made clearer by providing more details about what the code does. For example, the documentation could explain how the code works and how to use it.

CODEFORCES 842_A. Kirill And The Game

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a letter instead of an integer. This can cause the program to crash or output incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect calculation of potion efficiency**

The potion efficiency is calculated as the ratio of the amount of experience to the cost. However, the cost may be zero, which would cause the efficiency to be infinite. This can cause the program to crash or output incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect comparison of potion efficiency**

The program may compare the potion efficiency to k incorrectly. For example, the program may compare the potion efficiency to k using the == operator, which would not work correctly if k is not an integer.

**4. Incorrect output**

The program may output the wrong answer. For example, the program may output "YES" when a potion with efficiency k cannot be bought in the store, or it may output "NO" when a potion with efficiency k can be bought in the store.

**5. Other bugs**

There may be other bugs in the program that are not listed here. For example, the program may not handle errors correctly, or it may use incorrect data types.

Title:
CODEFORCES 863_A. Quasi-palindrome

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input is an integer number, so we should use `int` or `long long` to store it. If we use a smaller data type, such as `short` or `int`, we may get incorrect results.

**2. Not handling the case where `x` is 0**

The problem statement says that `1 ≤ x ≤ 109`, but it doesn't say anything about `x = 0`. So we need to handle this case separately.

**3. Not handling the case where `x` is a palindrome**

The problem statement says that a quasi-palindromic number is a number that can be transformed into a palindrome by adding some leading zeros. So we need to handle the case where `x` is already a palindrome.

**4. Not handling the case where `x` is not a quasi-palindromic number**

The problem statement says that a quasi-palindromic number is a number that can be transformed into a palindrome by adding some leading zeros. So we need to handle the case where `x` is not a quasi-palindromic number.

Title:
CODEFORCES 888_E. Maximum Subsequence

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect modular arithmetic**

When calculating the sum of a subsequence, it is important to take into account the modulus. For example, if the modulus is 10 and the subsequence is [1, 2, 3], the sum is 6, but the modulo sum is 6 % 10 = 6.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

When iterating through an array, it is easy to make an off-by-one error and miss a value. For example, if you are iterating through an array from 0 to n - 1, you need to make sure to check the value at index n - 1.

**3. Incorrect use of pointers**

When using pointers, it is important to make sure that they are pointing to the correct memory location. For example, if you are iterating through an array, you need to make sure that the pointer is pointing to the next element in the array.

**4. Array out-of-bounds errors**

When accessing an element of an array, it is important to make sure that the index is within the bounds of the array. For example, if you are trying to access the element at index n in an array of size n - 1, you will get an out-of-bounds error.

**5. Incorrect data type conversions**

When converting data types, it is important to make sure that the conversion is valid. For example, if you are trying to convert a float to an integer, you will get an incorrect result.

Title:
CODEFORCES 911_C. Three Garlands

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as expected, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input is "1 2 3 a", the program will expect the next three inputs to be integers, but it will get a letter instead. This will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect variable type**. The variable type may not be correct for the data it stores. For example, if the variable `k` is declared as an integer, but it stores a floating-point number, the program may produce incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one error**. This is a common mistake where the programmer forgets to add or subtract 1 from a calculation. For example, if the programmer is trying to find the smallest number in an array, they may forget to subtract 1 from the index of the last element. This will cause the program to return the wrong answer.
4. **Infinite loop**. This is a situation where the program enters a loop and never stops. This can happen if the programmer makes a mistake in the loop condition. For example, if the programmer writes `while (true)`, the loop will never end.
5. **Memory leak**. This is a situation where the program allocates memory but never frees it. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Data race**. This is a situation where two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the data to be corrupted or the program to crash.
7. **Race condition**. This is a situation where the outcome of a program depends on the order in which two or more events occur. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
8. **Deadlock**. This is a situation where two or more threads are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish because it is waiting for the other thread. This can eventually lead to the program running out of resources and crashing.

**3. Undefined behavior**

The program may behave in an unexpected way if the input is invalid. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

**4. Memory leaks**

The program may not properly release memory after it is finished running. This can lead to a decrease in performance and may even cause the program to crash.

**5. Race conditions**

The program may not be thread-safe. This can lead to incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.

**6. Deadlocks**

The program may deadlock if two or more threads are waiting for each other to finish. This can prevent the program from making any progress and may even cause it to crash.

**7. Security vulnerabilities**

The program may contain security vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system. For example, the program may not properly validate user input, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the program.

**8. Bugs in the algorithm**

The program may contain bugs in the algorithm that could lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may not properly account for all possible cases, which could lead to incorrect results.

CODEFORCES 95_C. Volleyball

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not standard, so it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is all integers, but if you accidentally use a floating-point number, the program will not be able to process it correctly.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When traversing a linked list or a tree, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one element. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program should be carefully checked to ensure that it is correct. For example, if you forget to check for a boundary condition, the program may crash.
5. **Memory leaks**. When allocating memory, it is important to free it up when you are done with it. If you don't do this, your program will eventually run out of memory and crash.
6. **Synchronization issues**. If multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is important to ensure that they are synchronized properly. Otherwise, you may get incorrect results.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. When writing a program, it is important to take security into account. For example, you should not allow users to input arbitrary data, as this could lead to a security breach.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design and test your program. You should also use a debugger to help you find errors.

Title:
CODEFORCES 987_A. Infinity Gauntlet

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the number of gems in the gauntlet.** The input for this problem is an integer, so you should use the `int` data type to store this value. If you use a different data type, such as a `float` or a `string`, you will get an incorrect answer.
2. **Not checking for invalid input.** The input for this problem is guaranteed to be a valid integer, but it is always a good idea to check for invalid input anyway. You can do this by using the `try`-`except` block.
3. **Using the wrong colors for the gems.** The colors of the gems are specified in the problem statement. Make sure that you use the correct colors in your code.
4. **Not using the correct output format.** The output for this problem is a list of the names of the absent gems. Make sure that you format your output correctly, or you will get a wrong answer.
5. **Making a mistake in your logic.** The logic for this problem is relatively simple, but it is still possible to make a mistake. Be careful to check your logic carefully before submitting your code.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* Using the `float` data type to store the number of gems in the gauntlet. This will cause the program to crash when it tries to divide the number of gems by 6.
* Not checking for invalid input. If the input is not a valid integer, the program will crash.
* Using the wrong colors for the gems. For example, using "blue" instead of "blue". This will cause the program to output the wrong answer.
* Not using the correct output format. For example, printing the names of the gems in all capital letters. This will cause the program to get a wrong answer.
* Making a mistake in your logic. For example, forgetting to subtract the number of gems that you already have from the total number of gems. This will cause the program to output the wrong answer.
Test inputs:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the number of gems in the gauntlet.**
```
n = input()
n = int(n)
```

**2. Not checking for invalid input.**
```
try:
    n = int(input())
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input")
    exit(1)
```

**3. Using the wrong colors for the gems.**
```
colors = ["purple", "green", "blue", "orange", "red", "yellow"]
```

**4. Not using the correct output format.**
```
for color in colors:
    if color not in gems:
        print(color.capitalize())
```

**5. Making a mistake in your logic.**
```
gems = set([color for color in input().split()])
print(6 - len(gems))
for color in colors:
    if color not in gems:
        print(color.capitalize())

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly using the `startswith()` method.** The `startswith()` method checks if a string starts with a given substring. In this problem, we need to check if a string ends with a given substring. To do this, we can use the `endswith()` method.
2. **Using the wrong data type.** The input strings are given as strings, but we need to store them as sets. To do this, we can use the `set()` function.
3. **Not handling the case where two strings have no common substring.** In this case, we can simply concatenate the two strings together.

HACKEREARTH panda-and-his-lazy-number

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the `fx(n)` function.** The `fx(n)` function should return the sum of divisors of `n`, but some implementations may return the wrong value. This can lead to incorrect results for the `lazy number` count.
2. **Incorrect use of the `2y` and `3fx(y)` terms in the `lazy number` definition.** The `2y` term should be the product of `2` and `y`, and the `3fx(y)` term should be the product of `3` and the `fx(y)` function. Some implementations may use the terms incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect results for the `lazy number` count.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The `lazy number` definition does not apply to numbers that are not divisible by `2` or `3`. Some implementations may not handle these edge cases correctly, which can lead to incorrect results for the `lazy number` count.
4. **Incorrect use of the `count` variable.** The `count` variable should be used to keep track of the number of `lazy numbers` between `L` and `R`. Some implementations may not use the `count` variable correctly, which can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect termination of the loop.** The loop should terminate when `R` is less than or equal to `L`. Some implementations may not terminate the loop correctly, which can lead to incorrect results.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand the requirements.
* Implement the `fx(n)` function correctly.
* Use the `2y` and `3fx(y)` terms correctly in the `lazy number` definition.
* Handle edge cases correctly.

ATCODER p02587 AtCoder Beginner Contest 175 - Making Palindrome

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a list of strings and integers. If we use the wrong data type to store the input data, it will cause errors. For example, if we use a list of strings to store the integers, we will get an error when we try to access the cost of a string.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming algorithm. If we use the wrong algorithm, it will not give us the correct answer. For example, if we use a brute force algorithm, it will take a long time to run and it will not give us the correct answer.

**3. Not handling special cases**

The problem statement mentions that there is no choice of strings in which Takahashi can make a palindrome. We need to handle this special case in our code. If we don't handle this special case, our code will give an incorrect answer.

**4. Using incorrect variable names**

Using incorrect variable names can make our code difficult to read and understand. For example, if we use a variable name like `n` to store the number of strings, it will be difficult to understand what the variable is used for.

**5. Not commenting your code**

Not commenting your code can make it difficult for other people to understand what your code is doing. It is important to comment your code so that other people can understand what your code is doing.

Title:
ATCODER p03268 AtCoder Regular Contest 102 - Triangular Relationship

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**

The input format is given as follows:

```
N K
```

However, some developers may mistakenly write the input format as follows:

```
N, K
```

This will cause the program to crash because the second argument is not a valid integer.

**2. The output format is not correct**

The output format is given as follows:

```
The number of triples (a,b,c) of positive integers not greater than N such that a+b,b+c and c+a are all multiples of K.
```

However, some developers may mistakenly write the output format as follows:

```
The number of triples (a,b,c) of positive integers not greater than N such that a+b,b+c and c+a are all multiples of K.
```

This will cause the program to print the wrong output.

**3. The program does not handle the case where N is negative**

The problem statement states that N and K must be positive integers. However, some developers may mistakenly write code that does not handle the case where N is negative. This will cause the program to crash.

**4. The program does not handle the case where K is not a prime number**

The problem statement states that K must be a prime number. However, some developers may mistakenly write code that does not handle the case where K is not a prime number. This will cause the program to give incorrect results.

**5. The program is not efficient**

The problem can be solved in O(N) time. However, some developers may write code that is not efficient and takes O(N^2) time or more. This will cause the program to run slowly for large values of N.

**6. The program has a bug**

Even if the program is correct in terms of the above points, it may still have a bug. For example, the program may not handle overflow correctly. This can cause the program to give incorrect results or to crash.

**7. The program is not robust**

Title:
ATCODER p03583 Tenka1 Programmer Contest - 4/N

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly specified, so it is possible for a developer to make a mistake and input the data in the wrong format. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of h, n, and w**. The formula for calculating h, n, and w is 4/N = 1/h + 1/n + 1/w. It is important to make sure that this formula is correctly implemented, as any mistake could lead to incorrect output.
3. **Using floating-point numbers**. The formula for calculating h, n, and w involves division, so it is possible for the results to be expressed as floating-point numbers. However, the problem statement specifies that h, n, and w must be integers, so it is important to round the results to the nearest integer.
4. **Using incorrect data types**. The problem statement specifies that h, n, and w must be positive integers, so it is important to use the correct data types to store these values. Using the wrong data types could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
5. **Not handling edge cases**. The problem statement specifies that there is a solution such that h, n, and w <= 3500. However, it is possible that the input value N is less than 3500, in which case there may not be a solution. It is important to handle this edge case gracefully, such as by printing an error message or exiting the program.
6. **Not using efficient algorithms**. The problem statement does not specify a time limit, so it is possible for a developer to use inefficient algorithms to solve the problem. This could lead to the program running slowly or even crashing. It is important to use efficient algorithms to solve the problem, such as the Euclidean algorithm.

Title:
ATCODER p03740 AtCoder Beginner Contest 059 - Alice&Brown

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the game rules.** The game rules are not very well-defined, and it is easy to make a mistake in implementing them. For example, it is not clear whether Alice and Brown can both take stones from the same pile, or whether they must take stones from different piles.
2. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The numbers in this problem can be very large, so it is important to be careful to avoid overflow errors. For example, if X and Y are both very large, the expression `2 * X - Y` could overflow.
3. **Incorrect use of pointers.** The problem states that Alice and Brown take turns performing the operation, but it does not specify how to implement this. It is possible to make a mistake if you are not careful about how you use pointers to track the state of the game.
4. **Incorrect use of recursion.** The problem can be solved using recursion, but it is important to be careful to avoid stack overflow errors. For example, if X and Y are both very large, the recursive function could call itself too many times and cause a stack overflow.
5. **Incorrect use of dynamic programming.** The problem can also be solved using dynamic programming, but it is important to be careful to avoid off-by-one errors. For example, if you are not careful, you could miss a state in the dynamic programming table.
6. **Incorrect use of the greedy algorithm.** The greedy algorithm is a simple algorithm that can often be used to solve problems quickly and easily. However, it is important to be careful when using the greedy algorithm, because it is not always guaranteed to find the optimal solution. For example, if you use the greedy algorithm to solve this problem, you could end up with a solution that is not optimal.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer might incorrectly implement the game rules and allow Alice and Brown to both take stones from the same pile. This would result in an incorrect answer.
* The developer might incorrectly handle overflow and cause an integer overflow error. This would also result in an incorrect answer.
* The developer might incorrectly use pointers and cause a segmentation fault. This would also result in an incorrect answer.
* The developer might incorrectly use recursion and cause a stack overflow error. This would also result in an incorrect answer.
* The developer might incorrectly use dynamic programming and miss a state in the dynamic programming table. This would result in an incorrect answer.
* The developer might incorrectly use the greedy algorithm and end up with a solution that is not optimal. This would also result in an incorrect answer.

Title:
ATCODER p03902 CODE FESTIVAL 2016 Elimination Tournament Round 2 (Parallel) - Takahashi the Magician

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not correctly followed. For example, if the input is `N M`, then the program will expect the next line to contain `A_(1,1)`, `A_(1,2)`, ..., `A_(1,M)`. However, if the next line contains `A_(2,1)`, `A_(2,2)`, ..., `A_(2,M)`, then the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not correctly followed. For example, if the answer is `-1`, then the program should print `-1`. However, if the program prints `1`, then the output is incorrect.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve the problem is incorrect. For example, if the algorithm tries to sort the sequences lexicographically, then the program will not be able to find the minimum number of casts of the spell.

**4. Incorrect data type**

The data type used to store the input data is incorrect. For example, if the input data is a list of integers, then the program should use a list of integers to store the data. However, if the program uses a list of strings to store the data, then the program will crash.

**5. Incorrect variable initialization**

The variables used in the program are not initialized correctly. For example, if the variable `N` is used to store the number of sequences, then the variable should be initialized to `0`. However, if the variable is initialized to `1`, then the program will crash.

**6. Incorrect logic**

The logic used in the program is incorrect. For example, if the program tries to sort the sequences by the first term, then the program will not be able to find the minimum number of casts of the spell.

Title:
AIZU p00008 Sum of 4 Integers

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input `n` is an integer, but the developer may accidentally use a floating-point type, such as `float` or `double`. This would cause the program to produce incorrect results.

**2. Using the wrong formula**

The formula for the number of combinations of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` that meet the equality `a + b + c + d = n` is:

```
C(n + 3, 4)
```

where `C` is the binomial coefficient. The developer may accidentally use the wrong formula, such as `C(n + 4, 4)` or `C(n + 3, 3)`. This would also cause the program to produce incorrect results.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When counting the number of combinations, the developer may accidentally count one combination too many or one combination too few. This could be caused by a mistake in the algorithm or by a mistake in the implementation.

**4. Overflow errors**

When the value of `n` is large, the developer may accidentally overflow the integer data type. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**5. Memory errors**

If the developer does not allocate enough memory for the data structures used in the program, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

Title:
AIZU p00461 IOIOI

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always followed correctly. For example, the input may contain a non-integer value or a string instead of an integer. The developer should check the input format carefully and handle invalid inputs appropriately.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of Pn strings**. The number of Pn strings in a string can be calculated by counting the number of occurrences of the substring "IOIO". However, the developer may make a mistake in this calculation, such as counting the same substring multiple times or forgetting to count some substrings.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format should be a single integer that indicates the number of Pn strings in the input string. The developer should make sure that the output format is correct.
4. **Other bugs**. There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the developer may use an incorrect algorithm to calculate the number of Pn strings, or the developer may make a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. The developer should also test the code thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly.

We can use a `for` loop to iterate over the list of integers. In each iteration, we can check if the current integer is divisible by all the other integers in the list. If it is not, then we can print `"Cannot pay some amount"` and exit the program.

Case #3:
We can use a `while` loop to iterate over the list of integers. In each iteration, we can check if the current integer is divisible by all the other integers in the list. If it is, then we can print `"Cannot use greedy algorithm"` and exit the program.

Case #4:
We can use a `for` loop to iterate over the list of integers. In each iteration, we can check if the current integer is divisible by all the other integers in the list. If it is, then we can print `"OK"` and exit the program.

Title:
AIZU p01330 The Number of Solutions for a Polynomial

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for P**

The problem states that P is a prime number, but the input is not validated. This could lead to a bug where the program incorrectly calculates the number of solutions for a polynomial with a non-prime P.

**2. Using the wrong data type for z**

The problem states that z is an integer, but the input is not validated. This could lead to a bug where the program incorrectly calculates the number of solutions for a polynomial with a non-integer z.

**3. Using the wrong algorithm to calculate the number of solutions**

The problem states that the number of solutions for a polynomial can be calculated using the Chinese remainder theorem. However, the program may use a different algorithm that is incorrect.

**4. Not handling the case where P = 0**

The problem states that the end of input is indicated when both N and P are 0. However, the program may not handle this case correctly.

**5. Not handling the case where aN = 0**

The problem states that aN ≠ 0. However, the program may not handle this case correctly.

Title:
AIZU p01497 Bubble Puzzle

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not well-defined. It is not clear what to do if the input contains invalid characters. For example, if the input contains a letter, should the program crash? Or should the program ignore the letter and continue to parse the rest of the input?

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is also not well-defined. It is not clear what to do if the answer is bigger than 5. Should the program print -1? Or should the program print an error message?

**3. Incorrect assumptions about the problem**

The problem statement states that "waterdrops do not collide with each other". However, this is not true in general. For example, if two waterdrops are in the same square, they will collide with each other.

**4. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The algorithm that the developer implements to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not take into account all of the possible states of the grid.

**5. Incorrect testing of the algorithm**

The developer may not test the algorithm thoroughly enough. This could lead to bugs that are not caught until the algorithm is deployed in production.

**6. Incorrect deployment of the algorithm**

The developer may deploy the algorithm to production without fully understanding how it works. This could lead to problems such as incorrect results or security vulnerabilities.

AIZU p01667 Everlasting Zero

Pain points:
The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are as follows:

* **Incorrectly parsing the input data.** The input data is formatted in a specific way, and if it is not parsed correctly, the program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.
* **Incorrectly implementing the solution algorithm.** The solution algorithm for this problem is relatively straightforward, but it is important to make sure that it is implemented correctly.
* **Incorrectly handling edge cases.** The input data may contain edge cases that the program must be able to handle correctly. For example, the input data may contain negative skill points or skill points that are greater than the maximum allowed value.
* **Insufficient testing.** It is important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it is working correctly. This includes testing the program with both valid and invalid input data.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
AIZU p02227 Test

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the UnionFind data structure.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. The UnionFind data structure must be implemented correctly in order to ensure that the algorithm works correctly.
2. **Incorrect use of the UnionFind data structure.** Developers must be careful not to use the UnionFind data structure incorrectly. For example, they must not attempt to union two disjoint sets or to find the representative of a set that does not exist.
3. **Incorrect handling of errors.** Developers must be careful to handle errors correctly. For example, they must check for invalid input and ensure that the UnionFind data structure does not become corrupted.
4. **Incorrect performance.** The UnionFind data structure can be implemented in a variety of ways, each with different performance characteristics. Developers must choose an implementation that is appropriate for the problem they are solving.
5. **Incorrect debugging.** Developers must be able to debug their code effectively in order to find and fix errors. They should use a variety of debugging tools and techniques to help them identify the source of problems.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that developers may encounter when solving this problem:

* A developer may incorrectly implement the UnionFind data structure by using an array to store the parent pointers. This will cause the algorithm to run in O(n^2) time, which is much too slow.
* A developer may incorrectly use the UnionFind data structure by attempting to union two disjoint sets. This will cause the algorithm to return an incorrect result.
* A developer may incorrectly handle errors by failing to check for invalid input. This could cause the algorithm to crash or produce incorrect results.
* A developer may implement the UnionFind data structure in a way that is inefficient. This could cause the algorithm to run slowly or use too much memory.
* A developer may incorrectly debug their code, which could lead them to make incorrect assumptions about the cause of a bug. This could waste time and resources.

Title:
AIZU p02378 Bipartite Matching

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of lists. Each inner list contains 3 integers: the number of vertices in X, the number of vertices in Y, and the number of edges. The developer may accidentally parse the input data as a list of strings, which will lead to incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect algorithm**

The problem is asking for the maximum matching size in a bipartite graph. The developer may use an incorrect algorithm, such as the greedy algorithm, which will not always find the maximum matching size.

**3. Incorrect implementation**

The developer may make mistakes in the implementation of the algorithm, such as using incorrect data structures or making mistakes in the logic. This can lead to incorrect results.

**4. Runtime error**

The developer may not handle corner cases correctly, which can lead to runtime errors. For example, the developer may not handle the case where the input data is invalid.

**5. Memory error**

The developer may not allocate memory correctly, which can lead to memory errors. For example, the developer may allocate too much memory or not enough memory.
