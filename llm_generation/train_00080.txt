CODECHEF bwknight

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of loops**. The most common mistake is to use the wrong loop variable or to iterate over the wrong range. For example, you might try to iterate over the rows of a matrix using a column index, or you might try to iterate over a list of numbers using a string index.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. Another common mistake is to forget to add or subtract one when computing an index. For example, you might try to access the element at index `n - 1` of an array when the array only has `n` elements.
3. **Incorrect data types**. Make sure that you are using the correct data types for your variables. For example, you might try to store a number in a string variable, or you might try to compare a string to a number.
4. **Logical errors**. Make sure that your code is logically correct. For example, you might try to divide by zero, or you might try to access a variable that doesn't exist.
5. **Incorrect use of functions**. Make sure that you are using functions correctly. For example, you might try to pass the wrong arguments to a function, or you might try to call a function that doesn't exist.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these common problems:

* **Use the debugger**. The debugger can help you to identify errors in your code by allowing you to step through your code line by line and watch the values of your variables change.
* **Write unit tests**. Unit tests can help you to identify errors in your code by testing small sections of your code in isolation.
* **Get help from others**. If you are stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help from others. There are many online resources available, such as forums, Stack Overflow, and code review sites.

Title:
CODECHEF gerald05

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulo operator usage.** The modulo operator (%) should be used to ensure that the result is within the range [0, 1000000007]. For example, `(a + b) % 1000000007` instead of `a % 1000000007 + b % 1000000007`.

Title:
CODECHEF puppygm

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly handling edge cases.** The input may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers that are too large. The developer must make sure to handle these cases gracefully.
2. **Not considering all possible outcomes.** The developer must consider all possible ways that the game could be played, and make sure to account for all of them in their solution.
3. **Making a mistake in the implementation.** The developer must carefully implement their solution, and make sure to avoid any errors.
4. **Not testing the solution thoroughly.** The developer must test their solution thoroughly, and make sure that it works correctly on all possible inputs.
5. **Not using the most efficient algorithm.** The developer should use the most efficient algorithm possible to solve the problem. This will ensure that the solution is fast and scalable.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer might incorrectly assume that the input will always be valid. This could lead to errors when the input contains invalid values.
* The developer might not consider all possible outcomes of the game. This could lead to errors when the game is played in a way that the developer did not anticipate.
* The developer might make a mistake in the implementation of their solution. This could lead to errors such as incorrect results or the solution crashing.
* The developer might not test their solution thoroughly. This could lead to errors that are not caught until the solution is deployed in production.
* The developer might not use the most efficient algorithm. This could lead to a solution that is slow and/or does not scale well.

CODEFORCES 1013_D. Chemical table

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain a number that is too large, or it may contain a letter instead of a number. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format must be exactly as specified in the problem statement. For example, the output must be a single integer, and it must not contain any spaces or other characters. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be accepted.

**3. Undefined behavior**

Undefined behavior occurs when the program does something that is not specified in the C++ standard. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as dividing by zero or accessing a memory location that is out of bounds. Undefined behavior can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**4. Memory leaks**

A memory leak occurs when the program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

**5. Race conditions**

A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.

**6. Deadlocks**

A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can prevent the program from making any progress and eventually cause it to crash.

**7. Buffer overflows**

A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes data to a buffer that is not large enough to hold it. This can cause the program to crash or overwrite data in other parts of memory, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.

**8. Integer overflows**

An integer overflow occurs when a program tries to store a number that is larger than the maximum value that an integer can represent. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**9. Floating-point errors**

Floating-point errors occur when a program tries to perform a floating-point operation that is not exact. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results.

**10. Security vulnerabilities**

A security vulnerability is a weakness in a program that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system. Security vulnerabilities can be caused by a variety of factors, such as incorrect input validation, insecure coding practices, and poor system design.

CODEFORCES 1038_B. Non-Coprime Partition

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be a single integer n. If the input is not in the correct format, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be two lines, describing S_1 and S_2 respectively. Each set description starts with the set size, followed by the elements of the set in any order. Each set must be non-empty. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
3. **Incorrect calculation of gcd**. The gcd of two numbers is the largest integer that divides both numbers evenly. If the gcd of the sums of S_1 and S_2 is not greater than 1, then the program will incorrectly conclude that there is no solution to the problem.
4. **Incorrect partitioning of the numbers**. The numbers from 1 to n must be partitioned into two non-empty disjoint sets S_1 and S_2 such that the gcd of the sums of S_1 and S_2 is greater than 1. If the numbers are not partitioned correctly, the program will incorrectly conclude that there is a solution to the problem.
5. **Incorrectly handling multiple possible partitions**. If there are multiple possible partitions of the numbers into two non-empty disjoint sets S_1 and S_2, the program must print any of them. If the program only prints one partition, it is possible that it is not the correct partition.

By following these tips, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving the CODEFORCES 1038_B. Non-Coprime Partition problem.

CODEFORCES 1060_F. Shrinking Tree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the shrinking tree algorithm.** The most common mistake is to incorrectly implement the shrinking tree algorithm. This can lead to incorrect results or even a segmentation fault.

**2. Incorrectly computing the probabilities.** Another common mistake is to incorrectly compute the probabilities of each label becoming the label of the final vertex. This can lead to incorrect results or even a wrong answer.

**3. Using floating-point numbers incorrectly.** Floating-point numbers are notoriously difficult to work with, and it is easy to make mistakes when using them. This can lead to incorrect results or even a wrong answer.

**4. Not handling the special case of a tree with only one vertex.** The problem statement specifies that the input graph is a tree. However, it is possible that the input graph has only one vertex. This is a special case that must be handled correctly.

**5. Not handling the special case of a tree with two vertices.** The problem statement also specifies that the input graph is a tree. However, it is possible that the input graph has only two vertices. This is a special case that must be handled correctly.

**6. Not handling the special case of a tree with three vertices.** The problem statement also specifies that the input graph is a tree. However, it is possible that the input graph has only three vertices. This is a special case that must be handled correctly.

**7. Not handling the special case of a tree with four vertices.** The problem statement also specifies that the input graph is a tree. However, it is possible that the input graph has only four vertices. This is a special case that must be handled correctly.

CODEFORCES 1082_D. Maximum Diameter Graph

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**. The input format is `n`, followed by `n` integers. For example, if `n = 3`, the input should be `3`, followed by `3` integers.
2. The output format is not correct. The output should be `YES` or `NO`, followed by the diameter of the graph, followed by the number of edges in the graph, followed by the edges of the graph. For example, if the diameter of the graph is 2, and there are 4 edges in the graph, the output should be `YES 2 4`, followed by the 4 edges of the graph.
3. The graph is not connected. A connected graph is a graph in which there is a path between every pair of vertices.
4. The graph has self-loops or multiple edges. A self-loop is an edge that connects a vertex to itself. A multiple edge is an edge that connects two vertices more than once.
5. The degree of a vertex is not less than or equal to its upper limit. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to the vertex.
6. The diameter of the graph is not maximum possible. The diameter of a graph is the maximum number of edges in the shortest path between any pair of vertices.

To avoid these problems, make sure that you correctly follow the input and output format, and that you correctly construct the graph. You should also check that the graph is connected, that it has no self-loops or multiple edges, and that the degree of each vertex is less than or equal to its upper limit. Finally, you should check that the diameter of the graph is maximum possible.

CODEFORCES 1101_F. Trucks and Cities

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format of the problem is not very clear. It is not immediately obvious what the meaning of each line of input is. This can lead to errors in parsing the input and incorrect solutions.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format of the problem is also not very clear. It is not immediately obvious what the meaning of the output is. This can lead to errors in formatting the output and incorrect solutions.
* **Incorrect algorithm:** The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. This can lead to incorrect solutions.
* **Incorrect implementation:** The implementation of the algorithm may be incorrect. This can lead to incorrect solutions.
* **Incorrect test cases:** The test cases used to verify the correctness of the solution may be incorrect. This can lead to incorrect solutions.

Here are some specific examples of problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* The input format of the problem states that the first line contains two integers n and m. However, the first line of the example input contains only one integer n. This can lead to an error in parsing the input and an incorrect solution.
* The output format of the problem states that the output should be a single integer. However, the output of the example solution contains multiple integers. This can lead to an error in formatting the output and an incorrect solution.
* The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not take into account the fact that trucks can only refuel at cities. This can lead to an incorrect solution.
* The implementation of the algorithm may be incorrect. For example, the implementation may not correctly handle the case where a truck needs to refuel more than once. This can lead to an incorrect solution.
* The test cases used to verify the correctness of the solution may be incorrect. For example, the test cases may not include a case where a truck needs to refuel more than once. This can lead to an incorrect solution.

Title:
CODEFORCES 114_E. Double Happiness

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains two integers, l and r. If we use the wrong data type, such as `int`, to store these two integers, we may get an overflow error. To avoid this, we should use a data type that is large enough to store these two integers, such as `long long`.

**2. Using the wrong formula**

The question asks us to find the number of days on the segment [l, r], which are lucky for Peter and Bob at the same time. To do this, we need to know the number of prime numbers and the number of numbers that can be represented as `a^2 + b^2` in the interval [l, r]. We can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers in the interval [l, r]. However, we cannot use the same formula to find the number of numbers that can be represented as `a^2 + b^2` in the interval [l, r]. The correct formula is:

```
count = (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 2) / 2 - (r - l + 1)
```

**3. Off-by-one error**

When we calculate the number of prime numbers or the number of numbers that can be represented as `a^2 + b^2` in the interval [l, r], we need to make sure that we include the endpoints l and r. Otherwise, we will get an incorrect answer.

**4. Arithmetic error**

When we calculate the number of prime numbers or the number of numbers that can be represented as `a^2 + b^2` in the interval [l, r], we need to make sure that we do not get an arithmetic error. For example, if we calculate the sum of two large integers, we need to use the `long long` data type to avoid an overflow error.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a number that is too large or too small, or it may contain a non-integer value.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may contain a number that is too large or too small, or it may contain a non-integer value.

4. **Incorrect data structures**. The data structures used by the algorithm may not be appropriate for the problem. For example, the data structures may be too slow or too memory-intensive.
5. **Incorrect implementation**. The implementation of the algorithm may contain bugs. For example, the implementation may not handle all possible cases correctly, or it may not be efficient.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to develop a correct and efficient algorithm and to implement it correctly.

CODEFORCES 118_B. Present from Lena

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format should be a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 9). If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to process it and will throw an error.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a picture for the given n. You should strictly observe the number of spaces before the first digit on each line. Every two adjacent digits in the same line should be separated by exactly one space. There should be no spaces after the last digit at the end of each line. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce the desired output.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When computing the number of spaces before the first digit on each line, it is important to make sure that you are not off by one. For example, if n = 5, the first line should have 5 spaces before the first digit, not 4. If you are off by one, the program will not produce the correct output.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The logic used to generate the handkerchief pattern is essential for producing the correct output. If the logic is incorrect, the program will not be able to generate the correct output.
5. **Incorrect variable initialization.** The variables used to store the data for the handkerchief pattern must be initialized correctly. If the variables are not initialized correctly, the program will not be able to produce the correct output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1209_A. Paint the Numbers

Pain points:
**1. Using a brute force approach**

A naive approach to this problem would be to try every possible combination of colors and choose the one that minimizes the number of colors used. This approach would be very inefficient, as the number of possible combinations grows exponentially with the number of elements in the input.

**2. Using a greedy approach**

A more efficient approach would be to use a greedy algorithm. A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that makes locally optimal choices at each step in the hope of finding a globally optimal solution. In this case, we can greedily choose the smallest element in the input and assign it to a new color. We then repeat this process until all of the elements have been assigned to a color. This approach will not always find the optimal solution, but it is much more efficient than the brute force approach.

**3. Using a dynamic programming approach**

A dynamic programming approach is another efficient way to solve this problem. A dynamic programming algorithm builds up a solution to a problem by solving smaller subproblems. In this case, we can use dynamic programming to build up a table of the minimum number of colors needed to paint the first `i` elements of the input. Once we have this table, we can easily find the minimum number of colors needed to paint the entire input.

**4. Using a divide and conquer approach**

A divide and conquer approach is another efficient way to solve this problem. A divide and conquer algorithm divides the problem into smaller subproblems, solves the subproblems recursively, and then combines the solutions to the subproblems to find a solution to the original problem. In this case, we can divide the input into two subproblems, each containing half of the elements. We can then solve each subproblem recursively and combine the solutions to find the minimum number of colors needed to paint the entire input.

**5. Using a branch and bound approach**

A branch and bound approach is a more advanced technique that can be used to find the optimal solution to a problem. A branch and bound algorithm builds up a tree of possible solutions to the problem. At each node in the tree, the algorithm makes a decision about which subproblem to explore next. The algorithm stops exploring a subproblem if it can be proven that the subproblem cannot contain the optimal solution. The algorithm continues exploring subproblems until it finds the optimal solution.

**6. Using a genetic algorithm**

A genetic algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is inspired by the process of natural selection. A genetic algorithm starts with a population of randomly generated solutions to the problem. The algorithm then iteratively improves the population of solutions by selecting the best solutions and mutating them to create new solutions. The algorithm stops when it finds a solution that is good enough.

**7. Using a neural network**

A neural network is a machine learning model that can be used to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs. In this case, we could use a neural network to learn the relationship between the elements in the input and the number of colors needed to paint them. Once the neural network has been trained, we can use it to predict the number of colors needed to paint any new input.

**8. Using a reinforcement learning agent**

A reinforcement learning agent is an artificial intelligence agent that learns how to behave in an environment by interacting with it. In this case, we could use a reinforcement learning agent to learn how to paint the elements in the input so that the number of colors used is minimized. The agent would start by randomly painting the elements and then receive feedback on its performance. The agent would then use this feedback to improve its painting strategy.

CODEFORCES 1227_G. Not Same

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect array input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n, and the second line should contain n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. However, your code may not be able to handle inputs that do not conform to this format. For example, your code may crash if the input contains a newline character after the first integer n, or if the second line contains more than n integers.
2. **Incorrect array traversal**. The problem statement specifies that you need to iterate over the array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and remove one block from each index that has at least one block. However, your code may not be able to handle this correctly. For example, your code may iterate over the array in the wrong order, or it may not check to see if an index has at least one block before removing a block from it.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of operations**. The problem statement specifies that you need to remove all blocks from the array using at most n+1 operations. However, your code may not be able to calculate this number correctly. For example, your code may not account for the fact that you can remove multiple blocks from the same index in a single operation.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The problem statement specifies that you need to print an integer op in the first line, followed by op binary strings in the following lines. However, your code may not be able to print the output in the correct format. For example, your code may not print the correct number of binary strings, or it may not print the binary strings in the correct order.
5. **Incorrect error handling**. The problem statement does not specify any error conditions. However, your code should be able to handle errors gracefully. For example, your code should be able to handle the case where the input file does not exist, or the case where the input file is corrupted.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1292_D. Chaotic V.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is a list of integers, but the code is expecting a list of strings. This can be fixed by changing the `input()` function to `map(int, input().split())`.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The code is calculating the distance from each fragment to the node P by subtracting the fragment's index from the node's index. This will work for most cases, but it will fail if the fragment's index is equal to the node's index. This can be fixed by adding 1 to the fragment's index before subtracting it from the node's index.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code is looping through the fragments and adding the distance from each fragment to the node P to a running total. However, it is not taking into account the fact that the distance from a fragment to the node P may be the same as the distance from another fragment to the node P. This can be fixed by using a set to keep track of the distances that have already been added to the running total.
4. **Unnecessary computation**. The code is looping through the fragments and calculating the distance from each fragment to the node P. However, this distance can be calculated once for each node and then reused for each fragment. This can be done by creating a dictionary that maps each node to its distance from the node P.
5. **Inefficient algorithm**. The code is using a brute-force algorithm to find the node P that minimizes the total distance from each fragment to the node P. This algorithm can be improved by using a greedy algorithm or a dynamic programming algorithm.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def main():
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Create a dictionary that maps each node to its distance from the node P.
    distances = {}
    for i in range(1, 5001):
        distances[i] = i

    # Find the node P that minimizes the total distance from each fragment to the node P.
    min_distance = float('inf')
    min_node = None
    for node in distances:
        total_distance = 0
        for i in range(n):
            total_distance += distances[k[i]!] - k[i]
        if total_distance < min_distance:
            min_distance = total_distance
            min_node = node

    print(min_distance)

**6. Memory limit exceeded**

The program may run out of memory if it allocates too much memory. Memory limit exceeded verdicts will be given to programs that allocate more memory than the amount specified in the problem statement.

**7. Compilation error**

The program may not compile if there are errors in the code. Compilation errors will prevent the program from running and will result in a Wrong Answer verdict.

**8. Syntax error**

The program may not compile if the code does not follow the syntax rules of the programming language. Syntax errors will prevent the program from running and will result in a Wrong Answer verdict.
Test inputs:
**1. Incorrect input format**

```
1
```

This input is incorrect because it does not contain the number of elements in the array.

**2. Incorrect output format**

```
1000
```

This output is incorrect because it does not match the expected output format. The expected output format is a single integer, which is the minimum possible length of the array after performing the operation described in the problem statement.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

def shrink(a):
  for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
      a[i] = a[i] + 1
      a.pop(i + 1)
      n -= 1
  return n

print(shrink(a))
```

This program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem statement. The algorithm should only remove pairs of adjacent equal elements, but this program removes all elements that are equal to the first element in the array.

**4. Runtime error**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

while True:
  for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
      a[i] = a[i] + 1
      a.pop(i + 1)
      n -= 1
    else:
      break
```

This program will encounter a runtime error if the array does not contain any pairs of adjacent equal elements.

**5. Time limit exceeded**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

while True:
  for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
      a[i] = a[i] + 1
      a.pop(i + 1)
      n -= 1
    else:
      break
```

This program will run out of time if the array is large.

**6. Memory limit exceeded**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

while True:
  for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
      a[i] = a[i] + 1
      a.pop(i + 1)
      n -= 1
    else:
      break
```

This program will run out of memory if the array is large.

**7. Compilation error**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

def shrink(a):
  for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
      a[i] = a[i] + 1
      a.pop(i + 1)
      n -= 1
  return n

print(shrink(a))
```

This program will encounter a compilation error because the function `shrink` is not defined before it is called.

**8. Syntax error**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

def shrink(a):
  for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
      a[i] = a[i] + 1
      a.pop(i + 1)
      n -= 1
  return n

print(shrink(a))
```

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**. The input should be two integers N and S, separated by a space. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to parse the input and will produce an error.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be three lines. The first line should contain the word "YES" or "NO". The second line should contain the array of N positive integers with sum equal to S. The third line should contain the value of K. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will produce an error.
3. **Incorrect calculation of K**. The value of K must be between 0 and S. If K is not in this range, the program will not be able to win the game and will produce an error.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the array**. The array of N positive integers must have a sum equal to S. If the sum of the array is not equal to S, the program will not be able to win the game and will produce an error.

CODEFORCES 1398_F. Controversial Rounds

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input ```
6
11?000
```
is not correct because it contains a space between the number 6 and the string 11?000.
2. Incorrect output format. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output ```
6 3 2 1 0 0
```
is not correct because it contains a space between the numbers 6 and 3.
3. Incorrect calculation of the number of finished sets. The number of finished sets is not calculated correctly. For example, the input ```
6
11?000
```
and the output ```
6 3 2 1 0 0
```
are incorrect because the number of finished sets for x = 1 should be 5, not 6.
4. Memory leak. The program leaks memory. For example, the program ```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int n;
    scanf(" %d ", &n);
    char s[n];
    scanf(" %s ", s);
    return 0;
}
```
leaks memory because the array s is not freed when the program exits.
5. Race condition. The program has a race condition. For example, the program ```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int n;
    scanf(" %d ", &n);
    int a[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf(" %d ", &a[i]);
    }
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum += a[i];
    }
    printf(" %d ", sum);
    return 0;
}
```
has a race condition because the value of the variable sum is not guaranteed to be correct when the program prints it.
6. Deadlock. The program deadlocks. For example, the program ```
#include <pthread.h>
int main() {
    pthread_t t1, t2;
    pthread_create(&t1, NULL, foo, NULL);
    pthread_create(&t2, NULL, bar, NULL);

    pthread_join(t2, NULL);
    return 0;
}
void foo() {
    while (1) {
    }
}
void bar() {
    while (1) {

CODEFORCES 1422_B. Nice Matrix

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

When working with matrices, it is important to use the correct data types. For example, if the matrix is large, it is better to use `long long` instead of `int`. Otherwise, you may encounter overflow errors.

**2. Using incorrect algorithms**

There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. Some of them are more efficient than others. It is important to choose the right algorithm for the given problem.

**3. Not handling corner cases**

When writing code, it is important to handle all possible corner cases. For example, what happens if the matrix is empty? What happens if the matrix is not square? Make sure to test your code on all possible corner cases.

**4. Incorrect logic**

Another common mistake is incorrect logic. This can happen when you make a mistake in your algorithm or when you misunderstand the problem statement. It is important to carefully read the problem statement and to make sure that your code is correct.

**5. Insufficient testing**

One of the best ways to find bugs in your code is to test it thoroughly. This means testing your code on a variety of inputs and making sure that it produces the correct output. It is also important to test your code on corner cases.

**6. Using inefficient code**

When writing code, it is important to make it as efficient as possible. This means using the right data types, using the right algorithms, and avoiding unnecessary loops. It is also important to optimize your code for the specific problem that you are trying to solve.

**7. Not using a debugger**

A debugger can be a very helpful tool for finding bugs in your code. It allows you to step through your code line by line and to see the values of your variables. This can help you to identify the source of a bug and to fix it.

CODEFORCES 1491_E. Fib-tree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrectly counting the number of vertices in the tree.** This is a common mistake that can be made when traversing the tree. Be sure to keep track of the number of vertices you have visited, and make sure that it matches the number of vertices in the input.
2. **Not considering all possible ways to divide the tree into two Fib-trees.** When checking if a tree is a Fib-tree, you need to consider all possible ways to divide the tree into two subtrees. If you only consider one or two ways, you may miss a valid Fib-tree.
3. **Incorrectly checking if a subtree is a Fib-tree.** To check if a subtree is a Fib-tree, you need to verify that it has the correct number of vertices and that it can be divided into two Fib-trees by removing some edge.
4. **Using incorrect data structures.** When solving this problem, you will need to use data structures to store the vertices in the tree and to keep track of the edges. Be sure to use data structures that are appropriate for the problem, and that you use them correctly.
5. **Making off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that can occur when programming. Be sure to check your code carefully for these errors, and to use the correct indexes when accessing data structures.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* **Use a clear and concise solution.** The best way to avoid errors is to write a solution that is easy to understand and debug.
* **Test your code thoroughly.** Once you have written your solution, test it thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly.
* **Ask for help if you need it.** If you are stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help from a friend, family member, or teacher.

CODEFORCES 1514_B. AND 0, Sum Big

Pain points:
 1. **Incorrect implementation of the bitwise AND operation.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The bitwise AND operation is performed by using the `&` operator. For example, the expression `a & b` returns the bitwise AND of the two integers `a` and `b`.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the sum of the elements in the array.** This is another common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The sum of the elements in an array can be calculated by using the `sum()` function. For example, the expression `sum(array)` returns the sum of the elements in the array `array`.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the remainder when dividing by 10^9+7.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The remainder when dividing by 10^9+7 can be calculated by using the `%` operator. For example, the expression `a % 10^9+7` returns the remainder when the integer `a` is divided by 10^9+7.
4. **Incorrect input or output formatting.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The input and output for this problem must be formatted correctly. For example, the input should be a single line containing two integers, and the output should be a single line containing the number of arrays satisfying the conditions.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements. It is also important to test your code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1541_B. Pleasant Pairs

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the input array.** The input array is a list of integers, so it should be declared as a list of integers. If it is declared as a list of strings, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input.
2. **Using the wrong data type for the output.** The output should be an integer, so it should be declared as an integer. If it is declared as a string, the program will not be able to correctly print the output.
3. **Misusing the `zip()` function.** The `zip()` function takes two iterables as arguments and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains one element from each iterable. In this problem, we need to iterate over the input array and find all pairs of indices such that the product of the two elements at those indices is equal to the sum of the indices. We can do this using the following code:
```
for i in range(len(a)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(a)):
        if a[i] * a[j] == i + j:
            count += 1
```
4. **Using the wrong algorithm.** The naive algorithm for solving this problem would be to iterate over all pairs of indices and check if the product of the two elements at those indices is equal to the sum of the indices. This algorithm would have a time complexity of O(n^2). However, we can do better by using a more efficient algorithm. One such algorithm is the following:
```
def count_pleasant_pairs(a):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(a)):
            if a[i] * a[j] == i + j:
                count += 1
    return count
```
This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n).
5. **Not handling edge cases.** There are a few edge cases that we need to handle when solving this problem. For example, we need to handle the case where the input array is empty. We can do this by checking if the length of the array is equal to 0. If it is, we simply return 0.
6. **Using incorrect variable names.** It is important to use descriptive variable names when writing code. This will make it easier for other people to read and understand your code. For example, instead of using the variable name `i`, you could use the variable name `index`.
7. **Not commenting your code.** It is important to comment your code so that other people can understand what it does. This will make it easier for other people to maintain and extend your code.

Title:
CODEFORCES 169_A. Chores

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input data. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect variable type**. When reading the input data, it is important to make sure that the variables are of the correct type. For example, if you try to read a string into an integer variable, the program will crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating over an array, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one element. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program should be carefully checked to make sure that it is correct. For example, if you forget to check for a boundary condition, the program may crash or give incorrect results.
5. **Uninitialized variables**. All variables should be initialized before they are used. If a variable is not initialized, the program may crash or give incorrect results.
6. **Memory leaks**. When a program allocates memory, it is important to free that memory when it is no longer needed. If a program does not free memory, it will eventually run out of memory and crash.
7. **Race conditions**. When multiple threads access the same data, it is important to ensure that the data is accessed in a consistent manner. If a race condition occurs, the program may produce incorrect results or crash.
8. **Deadlocks**. When multiple threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, a deadlock can occur. A deadlock can prevent any of the threads from making progress, and the program will eventually crash.

CODEFORCES 189_D. AlgoRace

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of cities is not a positive integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values must be correct. For example, if the number of cities is a string instead of an integer, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be correct. For example, if the program tries to divide by zero, it will crash.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the program misses or adds one element to a calculation. For example, if the program is supposed to find the minimum of a list of numbers, but it misses the first number, the result will be incorrect.
5. **Array out-of-bounds errors**. Array out-of-bounds errors occur when the program tries to access an element of an array that does not exist. For example, if the program tries to access the 10th element of an array that only has 9 elements, the program will crash.
6. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when the program allocates memory but does not release it when it is finished with it. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
7. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more parts of the program try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even crashes.
8. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more parts of the program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish until the other one does. This can eventually lead to the program running indefinitely or crashing.
9. **Buffer overflows**. Buffer overflows occur when the program writes data to a buffer that is not big enough to hold it. This can lead to the program crashing or even allowing malicious code to be executed.
10. **Format string vulnerabilities**. Format string vulnerabilities occur when the program uses a format string that is not properly escaped. This can allow malicious code to be executed.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully test your code and to use a debugger to find any errors that may be present.

Title:
CODEFORCES 212_D. Cutting a Fence

Pain points:
**Possible problems:**

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not specified clearly. For example, it is not clear whether the input should be a list of integers or a string of integers.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not specified clearly. For example, it is not clear whether the output should be a list of floats or a string of floats.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The expected height of the rectangle is not calculated correctly. For example, the expected height of the rectangle is not the average of the heights of the planks in the rectangle.
4. **Incorrect rounding**. The output is not rounded to the correct number of decimal places.
5. **Incorrect error checking**. The error in the output is not checked to be within the specified tolerance.

**Possible bugs:**

1. **Off-by-one error**. The calculation of the expected height of the rectangle is incorrect because the index of the first plank in the rectangle is off by one.
2. **Index out of bounds error**. The calculation of the expected height of the rectangle is incorrect because the index of the first plank in the rectangle is out of bounds.
3. **Arithmetic overflow error**. The calculation of the expected height of the rectangle is incorrect because the sum of the heights of the planks in the rectangle overflows.
4. **Floating-point rounding error**. The output of the expected height of the rectangle is incorrect because the floating-point numbers are rounded incorrectly.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to carefully check the calculation of the expected height of the rectangle and the rounding of the output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 236_D. Let's Play Osu!

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is:

```
n
p1 p2 ... pn
```

where `n` is the number of clicks and `pi` is the probability of clicking the `i`-th click correctly.

A common mistake is to forget to put a space between `n` and the first `pi`. For example, the following input is incorrect:

```
30.5 0.5 0.5
```

The correct input should be:

```
3
0.5 0.5 0.5
```

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is a single real number. A common mistake is to output a floating-point number with more than 6 digits after the decimal point. For example, the following output is incorrect:

```
2.750000000000001
```

The correct output should be:

```
2.750000000000000
```

**3. Incorrect calculation of expected score**

The expected score for a play is calculated as follows:

```
E[S] = sum_{i=1}^n pi * (i^2)
```

where `pi` is the probability of clicking the `i`-th click correctly and `i^2` is the square of the length of the longest consecutive `O`s block starting at the `i`-th click.

A common mistake is to forget to multiply `pi` by `(i^2)`. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
def expected_score(n, p):
  """Calculates the expected score for a play.

  Args:
    n: The number of clicks.
    p: A list of probabilities of clicking each click correctly.

  Returns:
    The expected score for the play.
  """

  score = 0
  for i in range(n):
    score += p[i] * i
  return score
```

The correct code should be:

```
def expected_score(n, p):
  """Calculates the expected score for a play.

  Args:
    n: The number of clicks.
    p: A list of probabilities of clicking each click correctly.

  Returns:
    The expected score for the play.
  """

  score = 0
  for i in range(n):
    score += p[i] * (i ** 2)
  return score
```

**4. Floating-point arithmetic errors**

When calculating the expected score, it is important to be aware of floating-point arithmetic errors. These errors can occur when performing operations on floating-point numbers, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

A common mistake is to ignore floating-point arithmetic errors. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
def expected_score(n, p):
  """Calculates the expected score for a play.

  Args:
    n: The number of clicks.
    p: A list of probabilities of clicking each click correctly.

  Returns:
    The expected score for the play.
  """

  score = 0
  for i in range(n):
    score += p[i] * i
  return score
```

This code will produce incorrect results if the values of `p` are close to zero. A better way to calculate the expected score is to use the `math.fsum()` function. This function sums a list of floating-point numbers and returns a floating-point number with the same precision as the input numbers.

The following code is correct:

```
def expected_score(n, p):
  """Calculates the expected score for a play.

  Args:
    n: The number of clicks.
    p: A list of probabilities of clicking each click correctly.

  Returns:
    The expected score for the play.
  """

  score = 0
  for i in range(n):
    score += p[i] * i
  return math.fsum(score)
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 261_B. Maxim and Restaurant

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not correctly specified, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input format is specified as `n a1 a2 ... an`, but the input contains `n 1 2 3 p`, the program will crash because it expects `n` to be an integer, but it is actually a string.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not correctly specified, which may cause the program to output incorrect results. For example, if the output format is specified as `float`, but the program outputs `1`, the output will be incorrect because it is not a float.
3. **Incorrect data type.** The data type of the input and output values is not correctly specified, which may cause the program to crash or output incorrect results. For example, if the input values are specified as integers, but the program tries to calculate the average of them, the program will crash because it cannot calculate the average of integers.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors occur when the programmer accidentally misses or adds one to an index or count. For example, if the programmer is supposed to iterate over a list of 10 elements, but they accidentally iterate over a list of 9 elements, the program will miss the last element.
5. **Arithmetic errors.** Arithmetic errors occur when the programmer makes a mistake in a calculation. For example, if the programmer accidentally multiplies two numbers instead of adding them, the program will output an incorrect result.
6. **Logic errors.** Logic errors occur when the programmer makes a mistake in the logic of the program. For example, if the programmer tries to divide by zero, the program will crash.
7. **Memory errors.** Memory errors occur when the programmer allocates too much or too little memory for a program. For example, if the programmer allocates too little memory for a large array, the program will crash.
8. **Synchronization errors.** Synchronization errors occur when multiple threads try to access the same data at the same time. For example, if two threads try to update the same variable at the same time, the program may output incorrect results.
9. **Race conditions.** Race conditions occur when the outcome of a program depends on the order in which two or more threads execute. For example, if two threads try to read the same variable at the same time, the program may output different results depending on the order in which the threads execute.
10. **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, and as a result, neither thread can continue. For example, if two threads are both trying to lock the same resource, the program will deadlock.
Test inputs:
```
# 261_B. Maxim and Restaurant

        if a[i] + a[j] <= p:
            ans += 1

print(ans / (n*(n-1) / 2))
```
Title:
CODEFORCES 285_B. Find Marble

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always followed correctly. For example, the input may contain more than three integers on the first line, or the second line may not contain n space-separated integers. In such cases, the program should handle the incorrect input gracefully and output an appropriate error message.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not always followed correctly. For example, the output may contain negative numbers, or it may not be a single integer. In such cases, the program should handle the incorrect output format gracefully and output an appropriate error message.

**3. Undefined behavior**

The program may encounter undefined behavior if it is not careful about the order of operations. For example, the program may try to access an element of an array before it has been initialized, or it may try to divide by zero. In such cases, the program should handle the undefined behavior gracefully and output an appropriate error message.

**4. Memory leaks**

The program should be careful not to leak memory. This means that the program should free any memory that it allocates, and it should not leave any dangling pointers. Memory leaks can cause the program to run out of memory, which can lead to crashes.

**5. Race conditions**

The program should be careful not to create race conditions. A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to inconsistent data and incorrect results. The program should use mutexes or other synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions.

**6. Deadlocks**

The program should be careful not to create deadlocks. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely. The program should use mutexes or other synchronization mechanisms to prevent deadlocks.

**7. Security vulnerabilities**

The program should be careful not to create security vulnerabilities. This means that the program should not allow attackers to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data. The program should use appropriate security mechanisms to protect against these vulnerabilities.

**8. Other bugs**

There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These bugs can range from simple typos to complex logic errors. The best way to avoid these bugs is to carefully test the program and to use a debugger to find any errors that are missed by the tests.

Title:
CODEFORCES 426_D. Sereja and Table 

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input contains integers, so you should use `int` or `long long` to store them. Using `float` or `double` may lead to incorrect results.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

When you are iterating over an array, make sure that you check the bounds correctly. For example, if you are iterating over an array of size `n`, you should check that `i < n` instead of `i <= n`.

**3. Using uninitialized variables**

When you declare a variable, you need to initialize it to a value. For example, if you declare a variable `int x`, you should initialize it to `0` or `-1`. Otherwise, the value of `x` is undefined, and you may get unexpected results.

**4. Using incorrect algorithms**

There are many different algorithms for solving different problems. You need to use the correct algorithm for the problem you are solving. Using the wrong algorithm may lead to incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect logic**

When you are writing your code, make sure that your logic is correct. For example, if you are trying to find the maximum value in an array, you need to make sure that you compare all of the elements in the array.

**6. Insufficient testing**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it. This will help you to catch errors that you may have missed. You should test your code with different input values and make sure that it produces the correct output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 495_D. Obsessive String

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect substring matching**

One common mistake is to incorrectly match substrings. For example, if the input is `s = "ababa"` and `t = "aba"`, then the substrings `"a"`, `"b"`, and `"a"` all contain `t` as a substring, but the substrings `"ab"` and `"aba"` do not.

**2. Incorrect handling of overlapping substrings**

Another common mistake is to incorrectly handle overlapping substrings. For example, if the input is `s = "ababa"` and `t = "aba"`, then the substrings `"a"`, `"b"`, and `"a"` all contain `t` as a substring, but the substrings `"ab"` and `"aba"` do not.

**3. Incorrect handling of the modulo operator**

The modulo operator is often used in programming competitions to ensure that the output is within a certain range. However, it is important to remember that the modulo operator does not work the same way for negative numbers. For example, `(-1) % 10 == 9`, not `0`.

**4. Incorrect use of dynamic programming**

Dynamic programming is a powerful technique for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems. However, it is important to correctly define the subproblems and to use the correct recurrence relations.

**5. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

Even if the algorithm is correct, it is important to correctly implement it in code. This includes using the correct data structures and algorithms, and avoiding common programming errors.

**6. Incorrect testing**

It is important to test your code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. This includes testing for a variety of input cases, including edge cases.

Title:
CODEFORCES 546_C. Soldier and Cards

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. This can cause the program to crash or output incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong data type. For example, the number of cards may be a string instead of an integer. This can cause the program to crash or output incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program may contain logical errors that cause it to output incorrect results. For example, the program may not correctly calculate the number of fights or the winner of the game.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The program may make off-by-one errors when calculating the number of fights or the winner of the game. This can cause the program to output incorrect results.
5. **Infinite loops**. The program may enter an infinite loop if it is not properly designed. This can cause the program to crash or waste resources.
6. **Memory leaks**. The program may leak memory if it is not properly designed. This can cause the program to crash or run slowly.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input format. It is also important to check the data type of the input data and to use the correct data types in the program. The logic of the program should be carefully designed to avoid logical errors. It is also important to test the program thoroughly to catch off-by-one errors and infinite loops. Finally, the program should be designed to avoid memory leaks.

Title:
CODEFORCES 572_E. CNF 2

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

When working with Boolean logic, it is important to use the correct data types. For example, in Python, you should use the `bool` data type to represent Boolean values. Using the incorrect data type can lead to errors in your code.

**2. Misunderstanding the problem statement**

The problem statement for this question is quite clear, but it is still possible to misunderstand it. For example, you might think that you need to find a satisfying assignment for each clause, when in reality you only need to find a satisfying assignment for the entire CNF formula.

**3. Making incorrect assumptions**

When solving a problem, it is important to avoid making incorrect assumptions. For example, you might assume that each variable occurs in at most one clause, when in reality it is possible for a variable to occur in multiple clauses.

**4. Using inefficient algorithms**

There are a number of different algorithms that you can use to solve this problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. It is important to choose an algorithm that is appropriate for the size of the input data.

**5. Not handling all possible cases**

When writing code, it is important to handle all possible cases. For example, you need to handle the case where the CNF formula is not satisfiable.

**6. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it. This will help you to identify and fix any bugs.

**7. Submitting incorrect code**

It is important to make sure that your code is correct before submitting it. If your code is incorrect, you will not receive any points.

Title:
CODEFORCES 594_C. Edo and Magnets

Pain points:
1. **Wrong input format**. The input format is not always correctly parsed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number with a comma instead of a dot, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The program may expect a certain data type for the input, but the input contains a different data type. For example, if the program expects an integer, but the input contains a string, the program will crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. These are errors that occur when the program does not account for the fact that the index of the first element in an array is 0, not 1. For example, if the program tries to access the element at index 1 of an array that has only one element, the program will crash.
4. **Index out of bounds errors**. These are errors that occur when the program tries to access an element of an array that does not exist. For example, if the program tries to access the element at index 10 of an array that has only 5 elements, the program will crash.
5. **Arithmetic errors**. These are errors that occur when the program performs an arithmetic operation that results in an incorrect value. For example, if the program divides a number by zero, the program will crash.
6. **Logical errors**. These are errors that occur when the program does not follow the correct logic. For example, if the program tries to remove an element from an array that does not contain that element, the program will crash.
7. **Memory leaks**. These are errors that occur when the program does not release memory that it has allocated. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
8. **Race conditions**. These are errors that occur when two or more parts of the program try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
9. **Deadlocks**. These are errors that occur when two or more parts of the program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish because it is waiting for the other part to finish. This can lead to the program running indefinitely or crashing.
10. **Security vulnerabilities**. These are errors that allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the program or its data. This can lead to the program being compromised or the data being stolen.

Title:
CODEFORCES 616_A. Comparing Two Long Integers

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input size is very large, so it is important to use the correct data type to store the numbers. In this problem, the numbers can have up to 106 digits, so we need to use a data type that can store at least that many digits. The most common data types that are used to store integers are `int`, `long`, and `long long`. `int` can store up to 10 digits, `long` can store up to 19 digits, and `long long` can store up to 1018 digits. In this problem, we need to use `long long` to store the numbers.

**2. Using the wrong input/output method**

The input size is very large, so it is important to use a fast input/output method. In this problem, we need to use a method that can read a whole line or token at once. The most common input methods are `cin`, `scanf`, and `getline`. `cin` and `scanf` read characters one by one, which is very slow for large inputs. `getline` reads a whole line at once, which is much faster. In this problem, we need to use `getline` to read the input.

**3. Using the wrong algorithm**

The most straightforward way to compare two integers is to compare their values one by one. However, this algorithm is very slow for large integers. A faster algorithm is to use the [divide and conquer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm) algorithm. This algorithm works by recursively dividing the two integers into smaller and smaller parts until they are both equal. Once the two integers are equal, the algorithm returns `0`. If one integer is larger than the other, the algorithm returns `1` or `-1` depending on which integer is larger.

**4. Not handling special cases correctly**

The input may contain special cases, such as negative numbers, zero, and leading zeroes. It is important to handle these special cases correctly. For example, if the input contains a negative number, the algorithm should return `-1`. If the input contains zero, the algorithm should return `0`. If the input contains leading zeroes, the algorithm should ignore them.

**5. Not testing the code thoroughly**

It is important to test the code thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly. This includes testing the code with different inputs, including negative numbers, zero, and leading zeroes. It is also important to test the code with large inputs.

CODEFORCES 635_B. Island Puzzle

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n, but the input contains multiple integers.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the output should be a single string, but the output contains multiple strings.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The code may incorrectly count the number of islands or statues, or incorrectly compare the statues on different islands.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The code may not correctly implement the algorithm for rearranging the statues.
5. **Memory leak**. The code may not release memory that is no longer needed, which can lead to a system crash.
6. **Race condition**. The code may not be thread-safe, which can lead to incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data simultaneously.
7. **Security vulnerability**. The code may not be secure, which can allow attackers to access sensitive data or execute arbitrary code.

Title:
CODEFORCES 664_A. Complicated GCD

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input states that `a` and `b` can be up to `10100`, which is larger than the maximum value of a 64-bit integer. If you try to use a 64-bit integer to store `a` and `b`, you will get a `ValueError`.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks you to find the greatest common divisor of all integers from `a` to `b` inclusive. The naive approach is to iterate over all integers from `a` to `b`, and find the greatest common divisor of each pair of consecutive integers. However, this approach is very inefficient, as it takes `O(b)` time.

A more efficient approach is to use the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm takes `O(log(b))` time, which is much faster than the naive approach.

**3. Using floating-point numbers**

The problem states that `a` and `b` are integers. However, if you try to use floating-point numbers to store `a` and `b`, you will get a `TypeError`.

**4. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

The problem states that `a` and `b` are positive integers. However, if you try to use negative integers or zero, you will get a `ValueError`.

**5. Not handling overflow**

The problem states that `a` and `b` can be up to `10100`. However, if you multiply `a` and `b`, the result may overflow. You need to be careful to handle overflow correctly.

**6. Not handling division by zero**

The problem states that `a` and `b` are positive integers. However, if `b` is zero, then `a` divided by `b` is undefined. You need to handle this case correctly.
Test inputs:
```
# 1. Using the wrong data type

a, b = 10101, 10102

# 2. Using the wrong algorithm

a, b = 1, 2

# 3. Using floating-point numbers

a, b = 1.0, 2.0

# 4. Using incorrect boundary conditions

a, b = -1, 2

# 5. Not handling overflow

a, b = 10100, 10101

# 6. Not handling division by zero

CODEFORCES 731_C. Socks

Pain points:
**1. Input format**

The first line of input contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000, 0 ≤ m ≤ 200 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 200 000) — the number of socks, the number of days and the number of available colors respectively.

The second line contain n integers c1, c2, ..., cn (1 ≤ ci ≤ k) — current colors of Arseniy's socks.

Each of the following m lines contains two integers li and ri (1 ≤ li, ri ≤ n, li ≠ ri) — indices of socks which Arseniy should wear during the i-th day.

**2. Output format**

Print one integer — the minimum number of socks that should have their colors changed in order to be able to obey the instructions and not make people laugh from watching the socks of different colors.

**3. Possible problems**

* **Incorrect input format**. The input format is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading it. For example, you might accidentally read the number of socks as the number of days, or vice versa. You might also forget to read the number of colors, or you might read it incorrectly.
* **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when writing it. For example, you might accidentally print the wrong number of socks, or you might print the socks in the wrong order.
* **Incorrect solution**. There are a few different ways to solve this problem, and it is easy to make a mistake in your implementation. For example, you might accidentally count the same sock twice, or you might forget to account for the fact that some socks might not be worn on any day.
* **Runtime errors**. This problem can be solved in O(n + m) time, but it is easy to write a solution that runs in O(n^2) time or even O(n^3) time. If your solution runs in too much time, it will be rejected by the judge.
* **Memory errors**. This problem does not require a lot of memory, but it is easy to write a solution that uses too much memory. For example, you might accidentally create a large array or you might keep track of too much information. If your solution uses too much memory, it will be rejected by the judge.

**4. Bugs**

* **Off-by-one errors**. This problem is full of opportunities for off-by-one errors. For example, you might accidentally index the array of socks one element too high or one element too low. You might also accidentally count the number of days one day too many or one day too few.
* **Arithmetic errors**. This problem also involves a lot of arithmetic, so it is easy to make a mistake. For example, you might accidentally add two numbers together incorrectly or you might accidentally divide a number by zero.
* **Logic errors**. This problem requires some careful thinking to solve, so it is easy to make a logic error. For example, you might accidentally assume that two socks are the same color when they are not. You might also accidentally forget to account for the fact that some socks might not be worn on any day.

**5. How to avoid these problems**

To avoid these problems, you should carefully read the input format and the output format. You should also carefully test your solution to make sure that it works correctly. Here are some specific tips for avoiding each of the problems listed above:

* To avoid incorrect input format errors, you should use the `scanf()` or `fscanf()` functions to read the input. These functions will check for errors and return an error code if there is a problem.
* To avoid incorrect output format errors, you should use the `printf()` or `fprintf()` functions to write the output. These functions will also check for errors and return an error code if there is a problem.
* To avoid incorrect solutions, you should carefully read the problem statement and understand the problem before you start coding. You should also carefully design your solution and write it out in pseudocode before you start coding.
* To avoid runtime errors, you should carefully analyze your solution and make sure that it runs in O(n + m) time. You should also profile your solution to make sure that it is not running in too much time.
* To avoid memory errors, you should carefully analyze your solution and make sure that it does not use too much memory. You should also profile your solution to make sure that it is not using too much memory.
* To avoid off-by-one errors, you should carefully check your code for off-

Title:
CODEFORCES 915_F. Imbalance Value of a Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. The tree traversal algorithm should visit each vertex exactly once, and it should not visit any vertex more than once.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the imbalance value.** The imbalance value is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the numbers written on the vertices on a simple path connecting two vertices. To calculate the imbalance value, you need to find the maximum and minimum values of the numbers written on the vertices on the path, and then subtract the minimum value from the maximum value.
3. **Incorrect handling of degenerate cases.** There are a few degenerate cases that you need to be aware of when solving this problem. For example, if the tree has only one vertex, then the imbalance value is 0.
4. **Memory leaks.** Make sure that you free up any memory that you allocate during the course of your solution. This is important to do, as memory leaks can cause your program to crash or run out of memory.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** Make sure that you handle any errors that occur during the course of your solution. For example, if you try to read a line of input from the console and there is no more input available, then you should handle this error gracefully.

Title:
HACKEREARTH goodies

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not specified in the problem statement. A developer may incorrectly assume that the input format is `T N X1 X2 ... XN`, where `T` is the number of test cases, `N` is the number of boxes in each test case, and `X1`, `X2`, ..., `XN` are the surprise values of the boxes in each test case. However, the actual input format is `T N`. This can lead to a bug where the developer tries to read the surprise values of the boxes before they have been read.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not specified in the problem statement. A developer may incorrectly assume that the output format is `M`, where `M` is the minimum number of boxes required to carry all of the goodies. However, the actual output format is `1` if all of the boxes can be put inside of each other, and `N` if not all of the boxes can be put inside of each other. This can lead to a bug where the developer outputs the wrong number of boxes.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, a developer may incorrectly assume that the boxes can be put inside of each other in any order. However, the boxes must be put inside of each other in a specific order, such that the smaller boxes are put inside of the larger boxes. This can lead to a bug where the developer outputs the wrong number of boxes.
4. **Incorrect error handling**. The code may not handle errors correctly. For example, the code may not handle the case where the input is invalid. This can lead to a bug where the code crashes or produces incorrect output.
5. **Incorrect unit testing**. The code may not be unit tested correctly. For example, the code may not test all of the possible inputs and outputs. This can lead to a bug where the code does not work as expected.
6. **Incorrect documentation**. The code may not be documented correctly. For example, the code may not include comments that explain what the code does. This can make it difficult for other developers to understand the code and to debug it if there is a bug.

Title:
HACKEREARTH power-set-game-3

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the powerset function.** The powerset function should return all possible subsets of a set, including the empty set and the set itself. A common mistake is to only return the non-empty subsets.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the function F.** The function F should return 1 if and only if (A is a subset of B and B is a subset of C and A is not equal to C). A common mistake is to return 1 if any of the following conditions are true: (A is a subset of B), (B is a subset of C), or (A is not equal to C).
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over the subsets of a set, it is important to make sure that you don't miss any subsets. A common mistake is to iterate over the subsets in the wrong order, or to miss a subset because you didn't account for the empty set.
4. **Modulo arithmetic errors.** When computing the sum of F over all possible triplets, it is important to use modulo arithmetic to ensure that the answer is correct. A common mistake is to forget to use modulo arithmetic, or to use the wrong modulus.
5. **Time complexity and space complexity.** The time complexity of your solution should be O(2^N), and the space complexity should be O(N). A common mistake is to use a recursive solution, which has a time complexity of O(N!) and a space complexity of O(N).
6. **Incorrect test cases.** When testing your solution, it is important to use a variety of test cases, including both small and large sets. A common mistake is to only test your solution on small sets, which can lead to incorrect results.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use a well-tested library function to implement the powerset function.
* Carefully review the definition of the function F to make sure you understand it correctly.

Title:
ATCODER p03019 AtCoder Grand Contest 034 - Tests

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is:

```
N X
b_1 l_1 u_1
b_2 l_2 u_2
:
b_N l_N u_N
```

where `N` is the number of exams, `X` is the maximum score Takahashi can achieve, and `b_i`, `l_i`, and `u_i` are the score Aoki will achieve, the minimum score Takahashi can achieve, and the maximum score Takahashi can achieve on the `i`th exam, respectively.

If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is a single integer, which is the minimum number of study hours Takahashi needs to win.

If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly output the answer and will likely crash.

**3. Incorrect calculation of minimum study hours**

The minimum number of study hours Takahashi needs to win is the sum of the differences between the maximum score Takahashi can achieve on each exam and the score Aoki will achieve on that exam.

If the calculation of the minimum study hours is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly output the answer and will likely crash.

**4. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

There are a few edge cases that the program must be able to handle correctly. For example, if `N` is 0, then Takahashi will automatically win and the program should output 0.

If the program does not handle edge cases correctly, it will likely crash or output incorrect results.

Title:
ATCODER p03159 AISing Programming Contest 2019 - Attack to a Tree

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect data type:** The input data is given as a string, but it needs to be parsed into integers. This can be done using the `int()` function.
* **Incorrect logic:** The algorithm for finding the minimum number of cables to disconnect is incorrect. A correct algorithm is as follows:
    1. Initialize a set `S` of all devices.
    2. For each cable `(u, v)`, remove `u` and `v` from `S` if they are both in `S`.
    3. The minimum number of cables to disconnect is the number of connected components in `S`.
* **Off-by-one error:** The algorithm for finding the minimum number of cables to disconnect may incorrectly count the number of connected components. This can be avoided by using a disjoint-set data structure.
* **Memory leak:** The algorithm for finding the minimum number of cables to disconnect may not free up memory properly. This can be avoided by using a garbage collector or by explicitly freeing up memory.
* **Timeout:** The algorithm for finding the minimum number of cables to disconnect may take too long to run. This can be avoided by using a more efficient algorithm or by parallelizing the computation.

Here are some specific examples of how these problems could occur in the given problem:

* The input data could be incorrectly formatted, such as if a number is not separated by a space from the other numbers. This could cause the `int()` function to fail and return the wrong value.
* The algorithm for finding the minimum number of cables to disconnect could incorrectly count the number of connected components. This could happen if a cable is disconnected that connects two devices that are not in the same connected component.
* The algorithm for finding the minimum number of cables to disconnect could not free up memory properly. This could happen if the algorithm uses a recursive data structure that does not have a destructor.
* The algorithm for finding the minimum number of cables to disconnect could take too long to run. This could happen if the algorithm is not efficient or if the input data is very large.

Title:
ATCODER p03302 SoundHound Inc. Programming Contest 2018 -Masters Tournament- - F

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The problem states that `a,b` are integers, but the solution code uses `int` instead of `long long`. This can lead to incorrect results if `a` or `b` is a large number.
2. **Incorrect operator precedence**. The problem states that `a+b=15` and `a*b=15` do not hold at the same time, but the solution code uses `a+b==15` and `a*b==15`. This can lead to incorrect results if `a+b` or `a*b` is equal to 15 but not exactly 15.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The solution code checks if `a+b` is equal to 15 by subtracting 15 from `a` and `b` and checking if the sum is 0. This can lead to an off-by-one error if `a+b` is equal to 14 or 16.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The solution code checks if `a*b` is equal to 15 by dividing `a` by 15 and checking if the remainder is 0. This can lead to an incorrect result if `a` is not divisible by 15.
5. **Unhandled edge cases**. The solution code does not handle the case where `a` or `b` is equal to 0. This can lead to a runtime error.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the constraints. It is also important to use the correct variable types and operators. Finally, it is important to test your code thoroughly to catch any errors.

Title:
ATCODER p03462 AtCoder Regular Contest 089 - ColoringBalls

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of modulo operator**

The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of dividing the left operand by the right operand. For example, 10 % 3 = 1, because 10 divided by 3 has a remainder of 1.

**2. Using the wrong data type**

When working with large numbers, it is important to use the correct data type. For example, if you are working with numbers that are greater than 2 ** 31 - 1, you will need to use a 64-bit integer.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when you forget to account for the first or last element in a sequence. For example, if you are counting the number of elements in an array, you need to make sure to start at index 0 and end at index n - 1.

**4. Using uninitialized variables**

Uninitialized variables are variables that have not been assigned a value. When you use an uninitialized variable, you are likely to get unexpected results.

**5. Not handling errors correctly**

It is important to handle errors correctly in your code. This means checking for errors before you use them and taking appropriate action if an error occurs.

**6. Using incorrect algorithms**

There are many different algorithms for solving different problems. It is important to use the correct algorithm for the problem you are trying to solve.

**7. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before you deploy it to production. This will help you catch bugs and ensure that your code is working as expected.

Title:
ATCODER p03621 AtCoder Grand Contest 019 - Shuffle and Swap

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The algorithm described in the problem statement is not correctly implemented. For example, the following code will not produce the correct output:

```
def shuffle_and_swap(A, B):
  """Shuffles the indices of the 1's in A and B, then swaps the corresponding elements."""

  a = [i for i, x in enumerate(A) if x == '1']
  b = [i for i, x in enumerate(B) if x == '1']
  random.shuffle(a)
  random.shuffle(b)
  for i in range(len(a)):
    A[a[i]], B[b[i]] = B[b[i]], A[a[i]]

```

This code will not produce the correct output because it does not take into account the fact that the indices of the 1's in A and B may not be unique. For example, if A = "110" and B = "101", then the code will swap the first and second elements of A, but it will not swap the second and third elements of B.

**2. Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic**

The problem statement specifies that the output should be modulo 998244353. However, many developers will forget to do this, and their code will produce incorrect results. For example, the following code will produce incorrect results:

```
def main():
  A = input()
  B = input()
  n = len(A)
  k = len([i for i, x in enumerate(A) if x == '1'])
  P = (n - k) * (k - 1) / (n * (n - 1))
  print(P * (k!)**2 % 998244353)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
```

This code will produce incorrect results because it does not perform the modulo operation when calculating P.

**3. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

The problem statement specifies that the input strings A and B must be of the same length and must contain the same number of 1's. However, many developers will forget to check for these conditions, and their code will crash or produce incorrect results. For example, the following code will crash if the input strings are not of the same length:

```
def main():
  A = input()
  B = input()
  n = len(A)
  k = len([i for i, x in enumerate(A) if x == '1'])
  P = (n - k) * (k - 1) / (n * (n - 1))
  print(P * (k!)**2 % 998244353)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
```

This code will crash because it tries to divide by zero when n = k.

**4. Incorrect use of floating-point arithmetic**

The problem statement specifies that the output should be an integer. However, many developers will accidentally use floating-point arithmetic in their code, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the following code will produce incorrect results because it uses floating-point arithmetic to calculate P:

```
def main():
  A = input()
  B = input()
  n = len(A)
  k = len([i for i, x in enumerate(A) if x == '1'])
  P = (n - k) * (k - 1) / (n * (n - 1))
  print(int(P * (k!)**2))

if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
```

This code will produce incorrect results because the value of P is not exactly representable as a floating-point number.

**5. Incorrect use of the Python random module**

The problem statement specifies that the indices of the 1's in A and B should be randomly permuted. However, many developers will incorrectly use the Python random module to generate the permutations. For example, the following code will not produce the correct results:

```
def shuffle_and_swap(A, B):
  """Shuffles the indices of the 1's in A and B, then swaps the corresponding elements."""

  a = [i for i, x in enumerate(A) if x == '1']
  b = [i for i,

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly followed. For example, the input may not have the correct number of lines, or the values in the input may not be in the correct format.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may not be in the correct data type. For example, the values may be strings instead of integers.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the logic may not account for all possible cases.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The logic may be correct, but the implementation may have an off-by-one error. For example, the logic may correctly find the number of unnecessary cards, but the implementation may incorrectly subtract one from the number of cards.
5. **Memory leak**. The implementation may not properly free up memory after it is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
6. **Race condition**. The implementation may not be thread-safe. This can lead to incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.
7. **Deadlock**. The implementation may deadlock if multiple threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can prevent the program from making any progress.
8. **Buffer overflow**. The implementation may not properly check the size of a buffer before writing to it. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can crash the program or allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

Title:
AIZU p01091 Complex Paper Folding

Pain points:
```
Possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible that the developer will misinterpret the input and make a mistake. For example, the input could be in the wrong order, or it could contain invalid characters.
2. **Incorrect calculation of perimeter**. The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of its sides. However, it is possible that the developer will make a mistake in calculating the length of a side, or in summing the lengths of all the sides.
3. **Incorrect identification of the most complex polygon**. The most complex polygon is the one with the largest number of vertices. However, it is possible that the developer will miscount the number of vertices, or will incorrectly identify a polygon with fewer vertices as being more complex.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single floating-point number representing the perimeter of the most complex polygon. However, it is possible that the developer will output the wrong format, or will include extra characters in the output.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that they understand the input format and the output format. They should also carefully check their calculations to make sure that they are correct. Additionally, they should test their code on a variety of input examples to make sure that it is working correctly.

Title:
AIZU p01227 Country Road

Pain points:
**1. The input data may not be valid.** For example, the number of houses or generators may be negative, or the coordinates of the houses may be out of range. The developer should check the input data for validity and raise an error if it is not valid.
2. **The developer may not be able to find the optimal solution to the problem.** The problem of finding the minimum total length of wires is NP-hard, which means that there is no known polynomial-time algorithm to solve it. The developer may need to use a heuristic algorithm to find a sub-optimal solution.
3. **The developer may not be able to implement the algorithm efficiently.** The algorithm for finding the minimum total length of wires can be very computationally expensive. The developer should use efficient data structures and algorithms to minimize the running time.
4. **The developer may not be able to handle large datasets.** The input data may be very large, and the developer may not have enough memory to store all of the data. The developer should use streaming algorithms or other techniques to process the data in a streaming fashion.
5. **The developer may not be able to deal with errors.** The program may encounter errors during execution, such as out-of-memory errors or segmentation faults. The developer should handle these errors gracefully and provide informative error messages.

NO
Possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* The input format is not very clear. It is not obvious what the different parts of the input represent.
* The problem description is not very clear. It is not clear what the agent is supposed to do or how the agent's hit points are affected by traps and potions.
* The problem is not very well-defined. It is not clear what happens if the agent's hit points become less than or equal to 0.
* The problem is not very challenging. The solution is fairly straightforward.

Here are some possible solutions to these problems:

* The input format could be made more clear by providing a more detailed description of the different parts of the input.
* The problem description could be made more clear by providing more examples and by explaining in more detail how the agent's hit points are affected by traps and potions.
* The problem could be made more challenging by adding additional constraints, such as a time limit or a limited number of potions.

Here is an example of a possible solution to the problem:

```
def main():
    # Get the input.
    hp_init, hp_max = map(int, input().split())
    r, c = map(int, input().split())
    grid = [input() for _ in range(r)]
    t = int(input())
    traps = {}
    for _ in range(t):
        trap_type, damage = input().split()
        traps[trap_type] = int(damage)
    s = int(input())
    steps = []
    for _ in range(s):
        step, n = input().split()
        steps.append((step, int(n)))
    p = int(input())
    potions = [int(input()) for _ in range(p)]

    # Calculate the agent's starting position.
    x, y = 0, 0
    for i in range(r):
        for j in range(c):
            if grid[i][j] == '.':
                x, y = i, j
                break

    # Calculate the agent's hit points after each step.
    hit_points = hp_init
    for step, n in steps:
        # Check if the agent is stepping on a trap.
        if grid[x + n * dx[step]][y + n * dy[step]] in traps:
            hit_points -= traps[grid[x + n * dx[step]][y + n * dy[step]]]

        # Check if the agent has any potions that can be used.
        if hit_points < hp_max and potions:
            # Find the potion that recovers the most hit points.
            potion = max(potions, key=lambda p: p - hit_points)

            # Use the potion and update the agent's hit points.
            hit_points += potion
            potions.remove(potion)

        # Check if the agent's hit points are still positive.
        if hit_points <= 0:
            return 'NO'

    # The agent has finished his patrol successfully.
    return 'YES'


# The following code defines the direction vectors.
dx = {'U': -1, 'D': 1, 'L': -1, 'R': 1}
dy = {'U': 0, 'D': 0, 'L': -1, 'R': 1}

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correct. For example, if the number of squares is not a positive integer, or if the cost of writing or erasing a circle is not a positive integer, an error will occur.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correct. For example, if the minimum cost is not a positive integer, or if the number of operations is not a positive integer, or if the operation is not "write" or "erase", an error will occur.
3. **Incorrect operation**. The operation is incorrect. For example, if you try to write a circle on a square that already has a circle, or if you try to erase a circle on a square that does not have a circle, an error will occur.
4. **Incorrect cost calculation**. The cost of the operations is not calculated correctly. For example, if you write a circle on a square that already has a circle, or if you erase a circle on a square that does not have a circle, the cost will be incorrect.
5. **Incorrect number of operations**. The number of operations is not correct. For example, if you try to write or erase more circles than there are squares, or if you try to write or erase more circles than the minimum cost, an error will occur.

Title:
AIZU p01843 Campaign

Pain points:
**Possible Problems and Bugs**

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correct. For example, the number of voters is not an integer, or the coordinates of the voters are not integers.
2. **Incorrect obstacle representation**. The obstacle is not represented as a polygon. For example, the number of vertices of the polygon is not an integer, or the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon are not integers.
3. **Incorrect voter representation**. The voter is not represented as a point. For example, the coordinates of the voter are not integers.
4. **Obstacles intersect**. Two or more obstacles intersect.
5. **Obstacles have self-intersections**. An obstacle has self-intersections.
6. **Voters are inside obstacles**. One or more voters are inside an obstacle.
7. **No voters can see Mr. X**. There are no voters that can see Mr. X.

**Solutions**

1. **Check the input format**. The input format can be checked by using the `assert` statement. For example, the following code checks that the number of voters is an integer:

```
assert type(num_voters) == int
```

2. **Check the obstacle representation**. The obstacle representation can be checked by using the `assert` statement. For example, the following code checks that the number of vertices of the polygon is an integer:

```
assert len(polygon) == num_vertices
```

3. **Check the voter representation**. The voter representation can be checked by using the `assert` statement. For example, the following code checks that the coordinates of the voter are integers:

```
assert type(x) == int and type(y) == int
```

4. **Check for obstacles intersections**. The obstacles can be checked for intersections by using the `intersects` function. For example, the following code checks if two obstacles intersect:

```
if intersects(obstacle1, obstacle2):
  # The obstacles intersect
```

5. **Check for obstacles self-intersections**. The obstacles can be checked for self-intersections by using the `self_intersects` function. For example, the following code checks if an obstacle has self-intersections:

```
if self_intersects(obstacle):
  # The obstacle has self-intersections
```

6. **Check if voters are inside obstacles**. The voters can be checked for being inside obstacles by using the `is_inside` function. For example, the following code checks if a voter is inside an obstacle:

```
if is_inside(voter, obstacle):
  # The voter is inside the obstacle
```

7. **Check if no voters can see Mr. X**. The voters can be checked for being able to see Mr. X by using the `can_see` function. For example, the following code checks if a voter can see Mr. X:

```
if can_see(voter, x, y):
  # The voter can see Mr. X
```

Title:
AIZU p01979 Gochiusa-Number

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator**. The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 = 1. This means that 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.
2. **Incorrect use of the division operator**. The division operator (/) returns the quotient of a division operation. For example, 10 / 3 = 3. This means that 10 divided by 3 gives a quotient of 3.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when a developer accidentally counts one more or one less than they should. For example, if a developer is counting the number of items in a list, they might accidentally count the first item twice or forget to count the last item.
4. **Incorrect use of conditional statements**. Conditional statements (if, else, and switch) are used to execute different code depending on the value of a condition. For example, the following code will print "Hello" if the variable `x` is equal to 1, and "Goodbye" if the variable `x` is equal to 2:

```
if (x == 1) {
  print("Hello");
} else if (x == 2) {
  print("Goodbye");
}
```

5. **Incorrect use of loops**. Loops are used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times. For example, the following code will print the numbers from 1 to 10:

```
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  print(i);
}
```

6. **Incorrect use of functions**. Functions are used to group together related code. For example, the following function will calculate the factorial of a number:

```
int factorial(int n) {
  if (n == 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}
```

7. **Incorrect use of variables**. Variables are used to store data. For example, the following code will assign the value "Hello" to the variable `x`:

```
String x = "Hello";
```

8. **Incorrect use of arrays**. Arrays are used to store multiple values of the same type. For example, the following code will create an array of five numbers and assign the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to the elements of the array:

```
int[] numbers = new int[5];
numbers[0] = 1;
numbers[1] = 2;
numbers[2] = 3;
numbers[3] = 4;
numbers[4] = 5;
```

9. **Incorrect use of objects**. Objects are used to create custom data types. For example, the following code will create a `Person` object and assign the values "John" and "Doe" to the `firstName` and `lastName` properties of the object, respectively:

```
Person person = new Person();
person.firstName = "John";
person.lastName = "Doe";
```

10. **Incorrect use of classes**. Classes are used to create blueprints for objects. For example, the following code will create a `Person` class with two properties, `firstName` and `lastName`:

```
class Person {
  String firstName;
  String lastName;
}
```

Title:
AIZU p02125 OOllOll

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The problem states that $N$ is a positive integer, so we should use an integer data type to store it. If we use a floating-point data type, we may get an incorrect answer.

**2. Not handling the case where $N = 0$**

The problem states that $f(0) = 0$, so we need to handle the case where $N = 0$. If we don't, we may get an incorrect answer.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the largest of $f(0)$, $f(1)$, ..., $f(N)$. A simple algorithm to do this is to iterate over all the numbers from 0 to $N$ and find the largest $f(x)$. However, this algorithm is inefficient because it takes $O(N)$ time. A more efficient algorithm is to use the following formula:

```
f(N) = N - (N / 2) * (N / 2)
```

This formula takes $O(1)$ time to evaluate, so it is much more efficient than the previous algorithm.

**4. Not handling overflow**

When calculating $f(N)$, we may need to perform arithmetic operations on large numbers. If we don't handle overflow correctly, we may get an incorrect answer.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it to make sure that it is correct. You can test your code by using a few different input values and checking the output.

Title:
AIZU p02265 Doubly Linked List

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the key**

The key of a doubly linked list can be of any data type. However, if you use the wrong data type for the key, you may encounter problems when trying to insert or delete elements from the list. For example, if you use a string as the key, you will not be able to compare keys for equality or order.

**2. Not initializing the doubly linked list properly**

Before you can use a doubly linked list, you must first initialize it. This means setting the head and tail pointers to NULL. If you do not initialize the doubly linked list properly, you may encounter problems when trying to insert or delete elements from the list.

**3. Not handling the case where the doubly linked list is empty**

When the doubly linked list is empty, the head and tail pointers will both be NULL. This means that you cannot insert or delete elements from the list. If you try to insert or delete an element from the empty list, you will encounter a segmentation fault.

**4. Not handling the case where the doubly linked list is full**

The doubly linked list can only hold a finite number of elements. If you try to insert an element into a full doubly linked list, you will encounter an overflow error.

**5. Not handling the case where the doubly linked list is circular**

A doubly linked list can be circular, which means that the last element points back to the first element. If you try to insert or delete an element from a circular doubly linked list, you may encounter problems.

**6. Not handling the case where the doubly linked list is doubly linked**

A doubly linked list is a linked list in which each node has two pointers: one to the next node and one to the previous node. If you try to insert or delete an element from a doubly linked list that is not doubly linked, you will encounter problems.

**7. Not handling the case where the doubly linked list is sorted**

A doubly linked list can be sorted, which means that the elements are in order from smallest to largest. If you try to insert or delete an element from a sorted doubly linked list, you may encounter problems.

**8. Not handling the case where the doubly linked list is reversed**

A doubly linked list can be reversed, which means that the order of the elements is reversed. If you try to insert or delete an element from a reversed doubly linked list, you may encounter problems.

**9. Not handling the case where the doubly linked list is sparse**

A doubly linked list can be sparse, which means that there are many gaps between the elements. If you try to insert or delete an element from a sparse doubly linked list, you may encounter problems.

**10. Not handling the case where the doubly linked list is dense**

A doubly linked list can be dense, which means that there are few gaps between the elements. If you try to insert or delete an element from a dense doubly linked list, you may encounter problems.

2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may not be in the correct data type. For example, the input may contain a string instead of an integer.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may forget to add or subtract 1 when calculating the row and column sums.
4. **Indexing error**. The developer may incorrectly index into the array of data.
5. **Memory leak**. The developer may not free up memory that is no longer needed.
6. **Buffer overflow**. The developer may write data to a buffer that is not large enough.
7. **Race condition**. The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data.
8. **Deadlock**. The developer may create a situation where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock.
9. **Security vulnerability**. The developer may introduce a security vulnerability by, for example, allowing untrusted input to be used to construct a malicious program.
10. **Unintended consequences**. The developer may not fully understand the implications of their code and may introduce unintended consequences.
