CODECHEF appuzzle

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not specified clearly. For example, it is not clear whether the third term, third last term, and sum should be separated by spaces or commas. This could lead to errors in parsing the input and incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of terms in the series**. The number of terms in the series can be calculated by subtracting the third term from the third last term and dividing by the difference between two consecutive terms. However, if the difference between two consecutive terms is not constant, this calculation will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect printing of the series**. The series should be printed in a single line, with the terms separated by spaces. However, if the series is long, it may be difficult to print all the terms on a single line. This could lead to errors in the output.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. The problem statement does not specify how to handle edge cases, such as when the third term or third last term is equal to 1 or the sum of the series is zero. This could lead to errors in the output.
5. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other potential bugs that could occur when solving this problem, such as incorrect handling of overflow errors, incorrect use of pointers, and incorrect use of memory.

Title:
CODECHEF cielrcpt

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not specified.**

The problem statement does not specify the input format. This could lead to confusion for developers who are not familiar with the problem domain. For example, is the input a list of integers? A string? A file?

**2. The output format is not specified.**

Similarly, the problem statement does not specify the output format. This could lead to confusion for developers who are not familiar with the problem domain. For example, should the output be a list of integers? A string? A file?

**3. The problem is not well-defined.**

The problem statement does not clearly define what is meant by "the minimum number of menus whose total price is exactly p". For example, does this mean the minimum number of different menus? Or the minimum number of menus, regardless of whether they are different?

**4. The problem is too difficult.**

The problem statement asks the developer to find the minimum number of menus whose total price is exactly p. This is a difficult problem, as it requires the developer to enumerate all possible combinations of menus and find the one with the minimum number of menus.

**5. The problem is too easy.**

The problem statement asks the developer to find the minimum number of menus whose total price is exactly p. This is a very easy problem, as the answer is always 1.

Title:
CODECHEF exebit01

Pain points:
```
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line of input is a single integer T, followed by T test cases. Each test case is a line with a single integer n in decimal number system. However, a developer may accidentally input a line with multiple integers, or a line with non-integer characters. This would cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that for each test case, the program should output the corresponding number in PNS, followed by a new line character. However, a developer may accidentally output the wrong number, or forget to add a new line character. This would cause the program to produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the nth number in PNS.** The nth number in PNS is calculated by multiplying the (n-1)th number by 4 and adding 1. However, a developer may accidentally make a mistake in this calculation, which would cause the program to produce incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The nth number in PNS can be very large, and may overflow the integer data type. A developer must be careful to handle overflow correctly, or the program may crash.
5. **Incorrect use of pointers.** The program uses pointers to store the numbers in PNS. A developer must be careful to use pointers correctly, or the program may crash.
6. **Incorrect use of dynamic memory allocation.** The program uses dynamic memory allocation to allocate memory for the numbers in PNS. A developer must be careful to allocate enough memory, or the program may crash.
7. **Incorrect use of the C standard library.** The program uses the C standard library to perform various tasks, such as reading input from the user and writing output to the console. A developer must be careful to use the C standard library correctly, or the program may crash.
8. **Incorrect error handling.** The program should handle errors gracefully. For example, if the user enters an invalid input, the program should print an error message and exit. A developer must be careful to handle errors correctly, or the program may produce incorrect output or crash.

Title:
CODECHEF lastride

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Letty Sequence**. The Letty Sequence is a position-based sequence, meaning that the weights assigned to positions in the number are all distinct positive Fibonacci numbers, in order. For example, in the Letty Sequence, the sequence of digits 1101 represents the number 1*5 + 1*3 + 0*2 + 1*1 = 9. Some numbers have more than one representation in the Letty Sequence. For example, we can also represent 9 as 10001, because 1*8 + 0*5 + 0*3 + 0*2 + 1*1 = 9.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the binary representation of the Letty Sequence**. The Letty Sequence can be represented as a binary number by taking the sequence of digits obtained in step 1 and interpreting it as a binary number (i.e., a number in base 2). For example, suppose that n=30. First, we compute that 30 in Letty Sequence is 1010001. Next, we compute that 1010001 in base 2 is 64+16+1=81. Hence, g(30)=81.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the XOR operation**. The XOR operation is a binary operation that takes two binary numbers as inputs and outputs a third binary number that is the result of the exclusive OR of the two inputs. For example, if the two inputs are 00100 and 00101, the output is 00001.
4. **Incorrect implementation of the modulo operation**. The modulo operation is a mathematical operation that takes two numbers as inputs and outputs a third number that is the remainder of the first number divided by the second number. For example, if the two inputs are 10 and 3, the output is 1.
5. **Incorrect input validation**. The input to the problem is a list of two integers, L and R. The values of L and R must be between 1 and 10^15, inclusive. If the values of L and R are not within this range, the program will crash.
6. **Incorrect output formatting**. The output of the program must be the required answer modulo 1000000007. If the output is not formatted correctly, the program will not be accepted.

Title:
CODECHEF pd32

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one errors.** When computing the Fibonacci numbers, it is important to make sure that you are computing the correct value for each term. A common mistake is to forget to add 1 to the previous term when computing the next term. This can lead to an off-by-one error, where the computed value is one less than the correct value.
2. **Incorrect termination condition.** When computing the Fibonacci numbers, it is important to make sure that you terminate the computation when you reach the desired number of terms. A common mistake is to continue computing terms after you have reached the desired number. This can lead to an infinite loop.
3. **Incorrect range check.** When computing the number of Fibonacci numbers in a given range, it is important to make sure that the range is valid. A common mistake is to try to compute the number of Fibonacci numbers in a range that does not contain any Fibonacci numbers. This can lead to a divide-by-zero error.
4. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.** When computing the Fibonacci numbers, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct data type. A common mistake is to use floating-point numbers when you should be using integers. This can lead to rounding errors that can affect the results of your computation.
5. **Incorrect use of recursion.** When computing the Fibonacci numbers recursively, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct base cases. A common mistake is to use the wrong base cases, which can lead to an infinite loop.

Title:
CODECHEF stfm

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the factorial function.** The factorial function is defined as `n! = 1 * 2 * ... * n`, but some implementations may incorrectly calculate it as `n! = n * (n - 1)!`. This can lead to incorrect results when calculating the sum of F(p1) + ... + F(pn).
2. **Using an incorrect modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. This means that if you divide a number by m and take the remainder, the result will always be between 0 and m - 1. However, some implementations of the modulo operator may return a negative number if the dividend is negative. This can lead to incorrect results when calculating the sum of F(p1) + ... + F(pn) modulo m.
3. **Using an incorrect data type.** The sum of F(p1) + ... + F(pn) can be very large, so it is important to use a data type that is large enough to store the result. Some implementations may use a data type that is too small, which can lead to overflow errors.
4. **Not handling overflow correctly.** If the sum of F(p1) + ... + F(pn) overflows the data type that is being used, the results will be incorrect. It is important to handle overflow gracefully by either truncating the result or by using a larger data type.
5. **Not using the correct modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) is only defined for integers. If you try to use the modulo operator on a floating-point number, the results will be incorrect. It is important to cast the floating-point number to an integer before using the modulo operator.
6. **Not using the correct data type for the modulus.** The modulus must be a positive integer. If you try to use a negative integer or a floating-point number as the modulus, the results will be incorrect. It is important to cast the modulus to an integer before using it.

CODEFORCES 1008_D. Pave the Parallelepiped

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format should be a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) followed by t lines, each containing three integers A, B, and C (1 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 10^5). If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer for each test case, representing the number of different groups of three points that satisfy all given conditions. If the output format is incorrect, the program will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of groups.** The number of groups can be calculated by using the following formula:

```
N = (A + 1) * (B + 1) * (C + 1) - 3 * (A * B + A * C + B * C)
```

However, if the calculation is incorrect, the program will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.
4. **Incorrect use of variables.** The variables A, B, and C should be used to store the dimensions of the parallelepiped. If the variables are used incorrectly, the program will crash or produce incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect use of loops.** The loops should be used to iterate over the possible values of a, b, and c. If the loops are used incorrectly, the program will crash or produce incorrect results.
6. **Incorrect use of mathematical functions.** The mathematical functions should be used to calculate the number of groups. If the mathematical functions are used incorrectly, the program will crash or produce incorrect results.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to carefully write the code and test it thoroughly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1031_B. Curiosity Has No Limits

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is "1 2 3" instead of "1 2 3\n", the first integer will be interpreted as the number of elements in the sequence, instead of the first element of the sequence.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correctly formatted, which can lead to the submission being rejected. For example, if the output is "1 2 3", instead of "1 2 3\n", the submission will be rejected.
* **Incorrect algorithm:** The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the algorithm assumes that the input is always valid, it may not work correctly if the input is invalid.
* **Incorrect implementation:** The algorithm may be implemented incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the algorithm uses a variable that is not initialized, it may contain garbage values that can affect the results.
* **Runtime error:** The algorithm may run into a runtime error, such as a stack overflow or a division by zero error. This can cause the submission to be rejected or to produce incorrect results.
* **Time limit exceeded:** The algorithm may take too long to run, which can cause the submission to be rejected.
* **Memory limit exceeded:** The algorithm may use too much memory, which can cause the submission to be rejected.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1054_B. Appending Mex

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect implementation of the mex() function.** The mex() function should return the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the given set. For example, the mex of the set {0, 2, 3} is 1, while the mex of the set {1, 2, 1} is 0.
* **Incorrect use of the mex() function.** The mex() function should only be used on sets of integers. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
int mex(vector<string> A) {
  // This code will not work correctly because the mex() function
  // only works on sets of integers.
}
```

* **Incorrect handling of empty sets.** The mex() function should return 0 when given an empty set. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
int mex(vector<int> A) {
  // This code will not work correctly because it returns -1
  // when given an empty set.
  if (A.empty()) {
    return -1;
  }

  // ...
}
```

* **Incorrect handling of duplicate elements in the set.** The mex() function should ignore duplicate elements in the set. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
int mex(vector<int> A) {
  // This code will not work correctly because it returns 0
  // when the set contains the duplicate element 0.
  sort(A.begin(), A.end());
  for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) {
    if (A[i] != A[i - 1]) {
      return A[i];
    }
  }

  // The set contains only duplicate elements, so return 0.
  return 0;
}
```

* **Incorrect handling of negative integers in the set.** The mex() function should not return negative integers. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
int mex(vector<int> A) {
  // This code will not work correctly because it returns -1
  // when the set contains the negative integer -1.
  sort(A.begin(), A.end());
  for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) {
    if (A[i] != A[i - 1]) {
      return A[i];
    }
  }

  // The set contains only negative integers, so return -1.
  return -1;
}
```

* **Incorrect handling of large integers in the set.** The mex() function should not return integers that are larger than the maximum value of an int. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
int mex(vector<int> A) {
  // This code will not work correctly because it returns 2147483647
  // when the set contains the integer 2147483647.
  sort(A.begin(), A.end());
  for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) {
    if (A[i] != A[i - 1]) {
      return A[i];
    }
  }

  // The set contains only the integer 2147483647, so return 2147483647.
  return 2147483647;

Title:
CODEFORCES 1076_B. Divisor Subtraction

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes.** The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple but efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given integer. A common implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes uses an array to mark which numbers are prime. However, if this array is not initialized to all zeros, then it is possible that some numbers will be incorrectly marked as prime. This can lead to incorrect results when counting the number of subtractions the algorithm will make.
2. **Using a loop that iterates over all the numbers from 2 to n.** The algorithm described in the problem statement only applies to positive integers. If the input value is negative, then the algorithm will never terminate. Additionally, if the input value is greater than 10^10, then the loop will take a very long time to run.
3. **Using a variable to store the number of subtractions.** The algorithm described in the problem statement does not require any variables to be stored. If a variable is used to store the number of subtractions, then it is possible that the variable will be overwritten by a subsequent subtraction. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Not handling the case where n is equal to 1.** The algorithm described in the problem statement does not work for n = 1. If n = 1, then the algorithm will never terminate.
5. **Not handling the case where n is a prime number.** The algorithm described in the problem statement does not work for prime numbers. If n is a prime number, then the algorithm will never terminate.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the algorithm. Additionally, it is important to test your code thoroughly to ensure that it produces the correct results.

CODEFORCES 1097_B. Petr and a Combination Lock

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain a number of rotations that is not between 1 and 15, or the angles of the rotations may be outside the range of 1 to 180 degrees. If the input format is incorrect, the program should raise an error.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not always correctly followed. For example, the output may not be a single word, or it may not be in all caps or all lowercase. If the output format is incorrect, the program should raise an error.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic of the program may be incorrect. For example, the program may not correctly check whether it is possible to rotate the lock so that the pointer points at zero after all of the rotations are performed. If the logic is incorrect, the program may give the wrong answer.

**4. Insufficient testing**

The program should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly. This includes testing with different input values, different combinations of rotations, and different logic. If the program is not tested thoroughly, it may contain bugs that will not be caught until it is used in production.

**5. Inefficient code**

The program may be inefficient, which could slow down its execution time. This could be a problem if the program needs to process a large amount of data or if it needs to be run repeatedly.

**6. Unmaintainable code**

The program may be difficult to maintain, which could make it difficult to fix bugs or add new features. This could be a problem if the program is used in a production environment or if it needs to be updated frequently.

For example, the input may contain a negative number, a number greater than 1000, or a number that is not an integer. If the input data is invalid, the program should raise an error.

**2. The output data may be invalid.**

For example, the output may contain a number that is not an integer, or a number that is not in the range from 1 to 1000. If the output data is invalid, the program should raise an error.

**3. The program may not be able to find a solution to the problem.**

For example, the input data may contain a set of numbers that cannot be arranged into a palindromic matrix. If the program cannot find a solution, it should print the message "NO".

**4. The program may be inefficient.**

The program should be as efficient as possible. It should not take too long to run, even for large input data sets.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1144_F. Graph Without Long Directed Paths

Pain points:
1. **Inability to find all the edges**. The input may not contain all the edges of the graph. In this case, the developer may try to find all the edges using a brute force approach, which is inefficient. A more efficient approach is to use a topological sort algorithm to find all the edges in topological order.
2. **Incorrect orientation of edges**. The developer may incorrectly orient the edges of the graph, resulting in a directed graph that contains paths of length two or greater. To avoid this, the developer should carefully check the orientation of each edge.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The developer may incorrectly format the output, resulting in an incorrect answer. To avoid this, the developer should carefully check the output format and make sure that it matches the expected format.
4. **Time complexity**. The developer may implement an algorithm with a time complexity that is too high. To avoid this, the developer should carefully analyze the time complexity of their algorithm and make sure that it is polynomial in the size of the input.
5. **Space complexity**. The developer may implement an algorithm with a space complexity that is too high. To avoid this, the developer should carefully analyze the space complexity of their algorithm and make sure that it is polynomial in the size of the input.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

* Use a topological sort algorithm to find all the edges of the graph. This will ensure that you find all the edges, even if the input is incomplete.
* Carefully check the orientation of each edge. Make sure that the edges are oriented in such a way that the resulting directed graph does not contain paths of length two or greater.
* Carefully check the output format. Make sure that the output matches the expected format.
* Analyze the time complexity of your algorithm. Make sure that the time complexity is polynomial in the size of the input.
* Analyze the space complexity of your algorithm. Make sure that the space complexity is polynomial in the size of the input.

CODEFORCES 1165_E. Two Arrays and Sum of Functions

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the prefix sum array.** The prefix sum array is a data structure that stores the sum of the elements of an array up to a certain index. It is often used to solve problems involving sums of subarrays. In this problem, we can use a prefix sum array to calculate the sum of $a_i \cdot b_i$ for all $i$ from $1$ to $n$. However, if we incorrectly implement the prefix sum array, we may end up with an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator is a mathematical operator that returns the remainder of a division. In this problem, we need to print the minimum possible value of $\sum_{1 \le l \le r \le n} a_i \cdot b_i$ modulo $998244353$. However, if we incorrectly use the modulo operator, we may end up with an incorrect answer.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that occurs when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. In this problem, we need to iterate over the elements of the arrays $a$ and $b$. If we make an off-by-one error, we may end up with an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect use of the array indices.** In this problem, we need to access the elements of the arrays $a$ and $b$ using their indices. If we incorrectly use the array indices, we may end up with an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect use of the mathematical operators.** In this problem, we need to perform a number of mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. If we incorrectly use these operators, we may end up with an incorrect answer.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and to implement your solution correctly. It is also helpful to test your solution on a few small test cases before submitting it to the judge.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly handling the input data.** The input data may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers that are too large. The developer should check the input data for validity and handle any errors appropriately.
2. **Incorrectly implementing the algorithm.** The algorithm for simulating the multiverse changes is complex and error-prone. The developer should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that their implementation is correct.
3. **Not handling edge cases.** The problem statement specifies a number of edge cases, such as the case where the multiverse is empty or the case where the Doctor is not in the multiverse. The developer should make sure to handle these edge cases correctly.
4. **Not using efficient algorithms.** The problem can be solved in O(n * t) time, where n is the number of universes and t is the number of decisions. The developer should use efficient algorithms to solve the problem as quickly as possible.
5. **Not testing the code thoroughly.** The developer should write a comprehensive test suite to ensure that the code is correct. The test suite should cover all of the different possible input cases, including the edge cases.

CODEFORCES 1203_A. Circle of Students

Pain points:
**1. Mismatch between input and output format**

The input format specifies that the first line of the input contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 200) — the number of queries. However, the example input contains 5 queries, but the example output contains only 4 answers.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The input format specifies that the first line of the input contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 200) — the number of queries. However, the example input contains the string "5" instead of the integer 5.

**3. Missing or extra data**

The input format specifies that the first line of the input contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 200) — the number of queries. However, the example input does not contain the second line of the input, which should contain a permutation of indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n), where p_i is the index of the i-th student (in clockwise order).

**4. Incorrect data**

The input format specifies that the first line of the input contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 200) — the number of queries. However, the example input contains the integer 3, which is not in the range 1 ≤ q ≤ 200.

**5. Logical errors**

CODEFORCES 121_C. Lucky Permutation

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct.**

The input format of the problem is `n k`, where `n` is the number of elements in the permutation and `k` is the lexicographical number of the permutation. However, some developers may mistakenly input `k n`. This will cause the program to crash.

**2. The output format is not correct.**

The output format of the problem is a single integer, which is the number of lucky numbers in the permutation that are located on the positions whose indexes are also lucky numbers. However, some developers may mistakenly output a string or a list of integers. This will cause the program to fail the test cases.

**3. The program does not handle all possible input cases.**

The problem statement states that the input `n` and `k` should be positive integers and that `k` should be less than or equal to `109`. However, some developers may not check these conditions and may accidentally write code that will crash when given invalid input.

**4. The program is not efficient.**

The problem can be solved in O(n log n) time. However, some developers may write code that is much slower. This could cause the program to time out on large test cases.

**5. The program has logical errors.**

The program may have logical errors that cause it to output incorrect results. For example, the program may incorrectly count the number of lucky numbers in the permutation or it may incorrectly identify the positions whose indexes are also lucky numbers.

**6. The program is not well-written.**

The program may be difficult to read and understand. This could make it difficult to debug and maintain.

**7. The program does not follow the style guide.**

The program may not follow the style guide of the programming language that it is written in. This could make it difficult to read and understand.

**8. The program is not secure.**

CODEFORCES 1264_D2. Beautiful Bracket Sequence (hard version)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input string may contain characters other than '(', ')' and '?'.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer, modulo 998244353.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the depth of a bracket sequence**. The depth of a bracket sequence is the maximum depth of any correct bracket sequence induced by removing some characters from it. For example, the bracket sequence s = "())(())" has depth 2, because by removing the third character we obtain a correct bracket sequence "()(())" with depth 2.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the sum of the depths of all bracket sequences**. The sum of the depths of all bracket sequences can be very large, so it must be calculated modulo 998244353.
5. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator**. The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. For example, 100 % 10 = 0, because 100 divided by 10 leaves a remainder of 0.

To avoid these problems, make sure that you understand the problem statement and the input format correctly. Also, be careful when calculating the depth of a bracket sequence and the sum of the depths of all bracket sequences. Finally, make sure that you use the modulo operator correctly.

CODEFORCES 1349_D. Slime and Biscuits

Pain points:
### Possible Problems

1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem is asking for the expected value of the time that the game will last, not the exact number of seconds it will last. This means that we need to take into account the possibility that the game could end in any number of seconds, not just a specific number.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for computing the expected value of the time that the game will last is fairly complex, and it is easy to make mistakes when implementing it. Some common mistakes include:
    * Using the wrong formula for computing the expected value.
    * Using the wrong data structures to store the state of the game.
    * Making incorrect assumptions about the behavior of the algorithm.
3. **Incorrect testing.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. This means testing it on a variety of different inputs, including inputs that are small, large, and pathological. It is also important to test your solution with different compilers and operating systems.
4. **Incorrect submission.** Once you are sure that your solution is correct, you need to submit it to the competition website. This can be a tricky process, and there are a number of things that can go wrong. Some common mistakes include:
    * Submitting the wrong file.
    * Submitting your solution to the wrong contest.
    * Not including the correct header information in your submission.

### Possible Bugs

1. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that can occur when programming. They happen when you forget to increment or decrement a variable by one, which can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Arithmetic errors.** Arithmetic errors can occur when you perform arithmetic operations on incorrect values. This can happen if you use the wrong data type, or if you divide by zero.
3. **Memory errors.** Memory errors can occur when you allocate or free memory incorrectly. This can lead to your program crashing or behaving in an unexpected way.
4. **Logic errors.** Logic errors can occur when you make a mistake in your code logic. This can lead to your program producing incorrect results, or even crashing.

## How to Avoid These Problems

To avoid these problems, it is important to:

1. **Read the problem carefully and understand what is being asked.** This will help you to avoid making mistakes in your implementation.
2. **Write your solution carefully and test it thoroughly.** This will help you to catch any errors in your code.
3. **Submit your solution correctly.** Make sure that you are submitting the correct file to the correct contest, and that you are including the correct header information.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid the most common problems and bugs that developers encounter when solving programming problems.

Title:
CODEFORCES 136_B. Ternary Logic

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong ternary representation**

The ternary representation of a number is a string of digits, each of which is 0, 1, or 2. The ternary representation of a number n is the string of digits that represents n when divided by 3, with the remainders written in reverse order. For example, the ternary representation of 14 is 102, because 14 / 3 = 4 with a remainder of 2.

When converting a decimal number to ternary, it is important to remember that the remainders must be written in reverse order. For example, the decimal number 14 would be converted to ternary as 210, not 102. This is because 14 / 3 = 4 with a remainder of 2, so the remainders should be written as 210.

**2. Using the wrong tor operation**

The tor operation is a ternary operation that is similar to the xor operation in binary. The tor operation of two numbers a and b is the number c such that a tor b = c. The tor operation is performed by adding the ternary representations of a and b together, and then taking the remainder when the sum is divided by 3.

For example, the tor operation of 14 and 50 is 34. This is because the ternary representations of 14 and 50 are 102 and 210, respectively. When these two numbers are added together, the sum is 312. The remainder when 312 is divided by 3 is 34, so the tor operation of 14 and 50 is 34.

**3. Not handling negative numbers correctly**

The tor operation can be used with negative numbers, but it is important to remember that the ternary representation of a negative number is the same as the ternary representation of its absolute value, with a leading minus sign. For example, the ternary representation of -14 is -102, not 210.

**4. Not handling overflows correctly**

The tor operation can sometimes cause overflows, which occur when the result of the operation is too large to be represented in ternary. When an overflow occurs, the tor operation should return the smallest possible number that is greater than or equal to the result of the operation.

For example, the tor operation of 100 and 100 is 101. This is because the ternary representation of 100 is 11111, and the ternary representation of 101 is 10000. When these two numbers are added together, the sum is 111111, which is too large to be represented in ternary. The smallest possible number that is greater than or equal to 111111 is 100000, so the tor operation of 100 and 100 should return 100000.

**5. Not handling invalid inputs correctly**

The tor operation can only be performed on two numbers that are both positive. If either of the inputs is negative, the tor operation should return an error.

The tor operation can also only be performed on numbers that are less than or equal to 109. If either of the inputs is greater than 109, the tor operation should return an error.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1392_B. Omkar and Infinity Clock

Pain points:
 1. **Wrong understanding of the problem.** The problem states that "For every i from 1 to n, replace a_{i} with d-a_{i}". So, after each operation, the array will be reversed. A common mistake is to think that the array will be sorted.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm is simple:
```
d = max(a)
for i in range(n):
    a[i] = d - a[i]
```
However, a common mistake is to forget to update `d` after each iteration.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When updating `d`, it is easy to make a mistake and increment or decrement it by one too many times.
4. **Incorrect input/output formatting.** Make sure that your output is formatted correctly, according to the problem statement.
5. **Runtime errors.** Make sure that your code runs in time for the given constraints.
6. **Memory errors.** Make sure that your code does not use too much memory, or it will be terminated by the judge.

CODEFORCES 1534_D. Lost Tree

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format of this problem is very specific. Make sure that you read the problem statement carefully and parse the input correctly.
* **Invalid queries:** The game master only allows Little Dormi to ask at most ⌈n/2⌉ queries. Make sure that you do not exceed this limit.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format of this problem is also very specific. Make sure that you print the output in the correct format.
* **Memory limit exceeded:** This problem can be solved in a relatively small amount of memory. However, if you are not careful, your solution may end up using too much memory and be terminated by the judge.
* **Time limit exceeded:** This problem can be solved in a relatively short amount of time. However, if your solution is not efficient enough, it may end up running out of time and being terminated by the judge.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** A common mistake that developers make is to not parse the input correctly. For example, they may forget to remove the newline character from the end of the input, or they may not correctly parse the space-separated integers in the input.
* **Invalid queries:** Another common mistake that developers make is to ask invalid queries. For example, they may ask a query for a node that does not exist, or they may ask a query for a node that has already been queried.
* **Incorrect output format:** A common mistake that developers make is to not print the output in the correct format. For example, they may forget to print the exclamation point (!) at the beginning of the output, or they may not print the edges in the correct order.
* **Memory limit exceeded:** A common mistake that developers make is to use too much memory. For example, they may create a large array to store the distances between all pairs of nodes, or they may use a recursive algorithm that does not terminate.
* **Time limit exceeded:** A common mistake that developers make is to use too much time. For example, they may use a brute-force algorithm that explores all possible solutions, or they may use a slow algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes.

**2. Using the wrong formula for the distance between two points.** The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the formula $\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}$.

**3. Not handling degenerate cases correctly.** A degenerate case occurs when three points are collinear. In this case, there is no unique middle point, so the number of triplets is zero.

**4. Using floating-point numbers incorrectly.** Floating-point numbers are not always accurate, so it is important to check for rounding errors.

**5. Using an inefficient algorithm.** The naive algorithm for counting the number of triplets takes $O(n^3)$ time. There are more efficient algorithms that take $O(n^2)$ time.

Title:
CODEFORCES 204_D. Little Elephant and Retro Strings

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be two space-separated integers n and k, followed by a string s. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data should be integers and strings. If the input data is of other data types, the program will crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. The program may incorrectly count the number of beautiful strings. For example, if the input is `3 2` and the string is `XXX`, the program should output 0, but it may output 1.
4. **Incorrect modulo operation**. The program may incorrectly perform modulo operation. For example, if the input is `10 2` and the string is `XXBXXWXXXX`, the program should output `166`, but it may output `167`.
5. **Incorrect time complexity**. The program may have a time complexity that is too high. For example, if the input is `10^6 2` and the string is all `X`, the program may take a very long time to run.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully check the input format, data types, and logic of your program. You should also use a modulo operation correctly and optimize your program for time complexity.

Title:
CODEFORCES 229_C. Triangles

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input format specifies that the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges `m` are both integers in the range `[1, 10^6]`. However, if you accidentally use a data type that is too small to store these values, your program will crash. For example, if you use `int` to store `n` and `m`, your program will crash when `n` or `m` is greater than `2147483647`.

To avoid this problem, you should use a data type that is large enough to store `n` and `m`. In C++, you can use the `long long` data type to store integers in the range `[-9223372036854775808, 9223372036854775807]`.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks you to find the total number of triangles in Alice and Bob's graphs. A triangle is a cycle of length 3. So, one way to solve this problem is to find all the cycles of length 3 in Alice and Bob's graphs, and then add up the number of triangles in each graph.

However, this is a very inefficient algorithm. The number of cycles of length 3 in a graph can be exponential in the number of vertices. So, this algorithm will take a very long time to run on large graphs.

A more efficient algorithm is to use the following fact: the number of triangles in a graph is equal to the number of edges in the graph minus the number of connected components in the graph.

To use this algorithm, you first need to find the number of edges in Alice and Bob's graphs. You can do this by simply counting the number of edges in each graph.

Then, you need to find the number of connected components in Alice and Bob's graphs. You can do this by using a depth-first search or a breadth-first search.

Once you know the number of edges and the number of connected components in each graph, you can simply subtract the number of connected components from the number of edges to find the number of triangles in each graph.

**3. Incorrect output format**

The output format specifies that you should print a single number, which is the total number of triangles in Alice and Bob's graphs. However, if you accidentally print more than one number, or if you print a non-numeric value, your program will receive a wrong answer.

To avoid this problem, you should make sure that your program only prints a single number, and that the number is a valid integer.

**4. Runtime errors**

If your program runs out of memory or time, it will receive a wrong answer. To avoid this problem, you should make sure that your program is efficient and that it does not allocate too much memory.

You can also use the `fflush(stdout)` function to flush the output buffer after each print statement. This will help to ensure that your program does not run out of time.

**5. Logical errors**

If your program contains logical errors, it will also receive a wrong answer. For example, if you accidentally count a triangle twice, or if you forget to count a triangle, your program will give the wrong answer.

To avoid this problem, you should carefully check your program for logical errors. You can also use a debugger to help you find logical errors.

Title:
CODEFORCES 300_A. Array

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specified in the problem statement is `n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100)`, followed by `n space-separated distinct integers a1, a2, ..., an (|ai| ≤ 103)`. However, a developer may accidentally use a different input format, such as `n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100)`, followed by `n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (|ai| > 103)`. This would cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specified in the problem statement is `n1 (n1 > 0) - the number of elements in the first set. Then print n1 numbers - the elements that got to the first set.
In the next line print n2 (n2 > 0) - the number of elements in the second set. Then print n2 numbers - the elements that got to the second set.
In the next line print n3 (n3 > 0) - the number of elements in the third set. Then print n3 numbers - the elements that got to the third set.`. However, a developer may accidentally print the output in a different format, such as `n1 (n1 > 0) - the number of elements in the first set. Then print n1 numbers - the elements that got to the first set.
In the next line print n2 (n2 > 0) - the number of elements in the second set. Then print n2 numbers - the elements that got to the second set.
In the next line print n3 (n3 > 0) - the number of elements in the third set. Then print n3 numbers - the elements that got to the third set.`. This would cause the program to produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, a developer may incorrectly assume that the product of all numbers in the first set must be negative, or that the product of all numbers in the second set must be positive. This would cause the program to produce incorrect output.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** A developer may accidentally miscount the number of elements in a set, or the number of elements in the array. This would cause the program to produce incorrect output.
5. **Memory errors.** A developer may accidentally allocate too much or too little memory for the program to run correctly. This would cause the program to crash.
6. **Floating-point errors.** A developer may accidentally use floating-point numbers when the problem statement specifies that integers should be used. This would cause the program to produce incorrect output.
7. **Other errors.** There are many other possible errors that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include, but are not limited to:
    * Syntax errors
    * Runtime errors

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a letter that is not a lowercase English letter, or the length of the string may be less than 1 or greater than 1000.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may contain a letter that is not a lowercase English letter, or the length of the string may be less than 1 or greater than 1000.
3. **Incorrect use of the `next_permutation()` function.** The `next_permutation()` function returns the next lexicographically greater permutation of a given string. However, if the given string is already the lexicographically largest possible string, the `next_permutation()` function will return an empty string. This can lead to a bug if the developer does not check for this case.
4. **Incorrect handling of palindromes.** The problem statement states that a string is tolerable if it does not contain any palindrome contiguous substring of length 2 or more. However, the developer may incorrectly check for palindromes of length 1 or more. This can lead to a bug if the given string contains a palindrome of length 1.
5. **Incorrect handling of the input string.** The developer may incorrectly assume that the input string is always a valid tolerable string. This can lead to a bug if the given string is not a valid tolerable string.
6. **Incorrect handling of the output string.** The developer may incorrectly assume that the output string is always a valid tolerable string. This can lead to a bug if the given string is not a valid tolerable string.

CODEFORCES 489_B. BerSU Ball

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is given as integers, so the developer should use the `int` data type to store the values. Using a different data type, such as `float`, could lead to incorrect results.

**2. Not handling invalid input**

The input data may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers greater than 100. The developer should check for invalid input and handle it appropriately.

**3. Not considering all possible cases**

The problem statement states that the partners' dancing skill in each pair must differ by at most one. The developer should make sure to consider all possible cases where this condition is met.

**4. Using inefficient algorithms**

The problem can be solved using a simple algorithm, such as a brute-force search. However, this algorithm is not very efficient and could take a long time to run for large input values. The developer should use a more efficient algorithm, such as a binary search, to solve the problem.

**5. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and works as expected. The developer should test the code with a variety of input values, including valid and invalid values.

CODEFORCES 566_C. Logistical Questions

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when writing it. For example, you might forget to put a space between two numbers, or you might put the wrong number of cities in the first line. If you make a mistake in the input format, the program will not be able to run correctly and you will get an error message.
2. **Incorrect data**. The data for this problem is also very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when entering it. For example, you might enter a negative number for the number of finalists in a city, or you might enter a road that does not connect two existing cities. If you make a mistake in the data, the program will not be able to run correctly and you will get an error message.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm that you use to solve this problem must be correct in order for the program to produce the correct output. There are many different ways to solve this problem, but not all of them are correct. If you use an incorrect algorithm, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and you will get an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. Even if you have a correct algorithm, you still need to implement it correctly in order for the program to run correctly. This means that you need to make sure that your code is syntactically correct and that it does not contain any logical errors. If you have an incorrect implementation, the program will not be able to run correctly and you will get an error message.
5. **Runtime errors**. Even if you have a correct algorithm and a correct implementation, your program might still run into runtime errors. These errors can occur for a variety of reasons, such as running out of memory or dividing by zero. If your program encounters a runtime error, it will stop running and you will get an error message.
6. **Incorrect output**. Even if your program runs correctly without any errors, it might still produce an incorrect output. This can happen if you have made a mistake in your algorithm or if you have used the wrong data. If your program produces an incorrect output, you will need to debug it to find the source of the error.

CODEFORCES 587_D. Duff in Mafia

Pain points:
**Possible Problems**

1. The input format is not clear. For example, it is not clear whether the numbers in the input are separated by spaces or commas.
2. The output format is not clear. For example, it is not clear whether the numbers in the output should be separated by spaces or commas.
3. The problem statement is not clear. For example, it is not clear what is meant by "a proper coloring".
4. The problem is not well-defined. For example, it is not clear what happens if there is no matching that satisfies the given conditions.
5. The problem is too difficult. For example, it is not possible to solve the problem in polynomial time.

**Possible Bugs**

1. The program may not correctly parse the input. For example, the program may incorrectly convert the input numbers to integers.
2. The program may not correctly check whether the given input satisfies the given conditions. For example, the program may incorrectly check whether the given roads form a proper coloring.
3. The program may not correctly find a matching that satisfies the given conditions. For example, the program may find a matching that does not minimize the destructing time.
4. The program may not correctly output the solution. For example, the program may output the solution in the wrong format.

Title:
CODEFORCES 609_F. Frogs and mosquitoes

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm.** The greedy algorithm tries to eat the closest mosquito to the frog. However, if there are multiple mosquitoes at the same distance, the algorithm may not choose the correct one. For example, if there are two mosquitoes at positions 1 and 2, and a frog is at position 0, the algorithm may choose to eat the mosquito at position 2, even though the mosquito at position 1 is closer.
2. **Incorrect handling of ties.** The greedy algorithm may not handle ties correctly. For example, if there are two mosquitoes at the same position, and a frog is at that position, the algorithm may not eat either mosquito.
3. **Incorrect handling of mosquitoes that are too far away.** The greedy algorithm may try to eat a mosquito that is too far away from the frog. This can happen if the frog's tongue is not long enough to reach the mosquito.
4. **Incorrect handling of mosquitoes that are already eaten.** The greedy algorithm may try to eat a mosquito that has already been eaten by another frog.
5. **Incorrect handling of mosquitoes that are eaten by multiple frogs.** The greedy algorithm may not correctly handle the case where a mosquito is eaten by multiple frogs. For example, if two frogs eat the same mosquito, the algorithm may not correctly update the length of the frogs' tongues.
6. **Incorrect handling of mosquitoes that are eaten in multiple steps.** The greedy algorithm may not correctly handle the case where a mosquito is eaten in multiple steps. For example, if a mosquito is first eaten by one frog and then eaten by another frog, the algorithm may not correctly update the length of the frogs' tongues.
7. **Incorrect handling of mosquitoes that are eaten by frogs in different orders.** The greedy algorithm may not correctly handle the case where a mosquito is eaten by different frogs in different orders. For example, if a mosquito is first eaten by frog A and then eaten by frog B, the algorithm may not correctly update the length of frog A's tongue.
8. **Incorrect handling of mosquitoes that are eaten by frogs with different tongue lengths.** The greedy algorithm may not correctly handle the case where a mosquito is eaten by frogs with different tongue lengths. For example, if a mosquito is first eaten by frog A with a tongue length of 1 and then eaten by frog B with a tongue length of 2, the algorithm may not correctly update the length of frog A's tongue.
9. **Incorrect handling of mosquitoes that are eaten by frogs with different positions.** The greedy algorithm may not correctly handle the case where a mosquito is eaten by frogs with different positions. For example, if a mosquito is first eaten by frog A at position 1 and then eaten by frog B at position 2, the algorithm may not correctly update the length of frog A's tongue.

Title:
CODEFORCES 658_B. Bear and Displayed Friends

Pain points:
 
 **1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data contains a lot of integers. If you use the wrong data type to store these integers, you may get unexpected results. For example, if you use `int` to store a very large integer, it may overflow and give you the wrong answer.

**2. Not handling corner cases**

The problem statement mentions some corner cases, such as "It's guaranteed that no two queries of the first type will have the same idi becuase one friend can't become online twice". If you don't handle these corner cases, your code may not work correctly.

**3. Making a mistake in the algorithm**

The algorithm for this problem is not very complicated, but it's easy to make a mistake. For example, you may forget to update the set of displayed friends when a new friend becomes online.

**4. Using inefficient algorithms**

The problem can be solved in O(n log n) time. However, if you use an inefficient algorithm, your code may run very slowly.

**5. Not testing your code**

It's important to test your code before submitting it. This will help you catch bugs and make sure that your code is correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 680_D. Bear and Tower of Cubes

Pain points:
**1. The developer may not understand the problem correctly.** The problem is about building a tower of cubes from blocks. The goal is to maximize the number of blocks in the tower while ensuring that the total volume of the tower does not exceed a given value.
2. The developer may not be able to come up with an efficient algorithm to solve the problem. The naive approach would be to try all possible combinations of blocks, but this would be very inefficient for large values of m.
3. The developer may not be able to correctly implement the algorithm. The algorithm involves a lot of bookkeeping, and it is easy to make mistakes.
4. The developer may not be able to test the algorithm correctly. The test cases should be comprehensive and should cover all possible edge cases.
5. The developer may not be able to write the output in the correct format. The output should be two integers: the maximum number of blocks in the tower and the maximum required total volume X.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. Read the problem carefully and make sure you understand all of the details.
2. Come up with a high-level solution to the problem before you start coding.
3. Implement the algorithm carefully and test it thoroughly.
4. Write the output in the correct format.
5. Ask for help from a mentor or teacher if you are stuck.

CODEFORCES 860_C. Tests Renumeration

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible that the input data is not in the correct format. For example, the input may contain a line with a non-integer number of tests, or the input may contain a line with a filename that is not a string of digits and small English letters. If the input format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is possible that the output data is not in the correct format. For example, the output may not contain the correct number of lines, or the output may contain lines with incorrect commands. If the output format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic of the program may be incorrect. For example, the program may not correctly identify the examples and regular tests, or the program may not correctly rename the files. If the logic of the program is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
* **Insufficient memory:** The program may not have enough memory to run correctly. For example, the program may need to store a large amount of data in memory, or the program may need to perform a large number of calculations. If the program does not have enough memory, it may crash or produce incorrect output.
* **Timeout:** The program may not finish running within the allotted time limit. For example, the program may need to perform a large number of calculations, or the program may need to wait for input from the user. If the program does not finish running within the allotted time limit, it will be marked as incorrect.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the program thoroughly with a variety of input data. Finally, it is important to choose an efficient algorithm for solving the problem.

CODEFORCES 887_B. Cubes for Masha

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain an integer n, which is the number of cubes. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to process the input and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the program should print a single integer, which is the maximum number that Masha can make using her cubes. If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will likely receive a incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program should be correct in order to produce the correct output. There are a few possible ways that the logic could be incorrect:
    * The program could miss a case where Masha can make a number.
    * The program could incorrectly count the number of times a digit appears on the cubes.
    * The program could incorrectly check if Masha can make a number from 1 to x.
4. **Memory errors**. The program should be careful not to allocate too much memory, or it could crash.
5. **Time errors**. The program should be efficient enough to run within the time limit, or it will not receive a correct answer.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement, and to test the program thoroughly before submitting it.

Title:
HACKEREARTH box-n-ball-1

Pain points:
1. The most important problem that a developer may encounter when solving this problem is **incorrectly calculating the radius of the largest ball that can fit in a box**. This can be avoided by carefully following the steps in the problem statement and ensuring that all calculations are performed correctly.
2. Another common problem is **incorrectly formatting the output**. The output should be a single floating-point number rounded to one decimal place. This can be avoided by using the `round()` function in Python or the `printf()` function in C++.
3. Finally, **incorrectly handling edge cases** can also lead to errors. For example, if the box is a cube, the radius of the largest ball that can fit in the box will be the same as the length of one side of the cube. This can be avoided by checking for edge cases before performing any calculations.

Here are some additional tips that may help you avoid common problems when solving this problem:

* Use a **test harness** to verify that your code is working correctly. This can help you catch errors early on and prevent them from causing problems in production.
* **Document your code** so that other developers can understand how it works. This will help to ensure that your code is maintainable and easy to debug.
* **Use version control** to track changes to your code. This will help you to roll back changes if necessary and to identify the source of any problems.

Title:
HACKEREARTH cutting-the-birthday-cake

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly calculating the area of the cake.** The area of a circle is $\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. Be careful not to make a mistake when squaring the radius.
2. **Incorrectly calculating the area of the cut piece.** The area of a rectangle is $A \times B$, where $A$ is the length of the rectangle and $B$ is the width of the rectangle. Be careful not to make a mistake when multiplying the length and width.
3. **Incorrectly determining who gets more to eat.** To determine who gets more to eat, you need to compare the area of the cut piece to the area of the remaining cake. The person who gets the larger piece will eat more.
4. **Not handling the case where the cutter is bigger than the cake.** If the cutter is bigger than the cake, then no piece can be cut out and both Alice and Bob will eat the same amount of cake.
5. **Not handling the case where the cutter is the same size as the cake.** If the cutter is the same size as the cake, then Alice will get to cut the cake and Bob will get to eat the remaining piece.
6. **Not handling the case where the cutter is smaller than the cake.** If the cutter is smaller than the cake, then Alice will get to cut the cake and Bob will get to eat the remaining pieces.

Title:
HACKEREARTH fun-with-primes-3

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong type for the input number.** The input number can be very large, so it's important to use a type that can store it without overflowing.

**2. Using the wrong type for the sum of the digits.** The sum of the digits can also be very large, so it's important to use a type that can store it without overflowing.

**3. Not checking if the number is divisible by 2.** A prime number can't be divisible by 2, so it's important to check if the number is divisible by 2 before checking if it's prime.

**4. Using a recursive algorithm to check if the number is prime.** A recursive algorithm can be very inefficient for large numbers, so it's better to use an iterative algorithm.

**5. Not handling the edge cases.** There are a few edge cases that need to be handled, such as the number 1, which is not prime, and the number 0, which doesn't have any digits.

**6. Using a brute-force algorithm to check if the number is prime.** A brute-force algorithm can be very inefficient for large numbers, so it's better to use a more efficient algorithm, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

Title:
HACKEREARTH palindrome-count-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting palindromes.** A palindrome is a string that is the same backwards and forwards. For example, "racecar" is a palindrome. However, "racecarx" is not a palindrome, because the "x" at the end makes it different from the reversed string "racecar". A developer might incorrectly count "racecarx" as a palindrome, because they forget to check for the "x" at the end.
2. **Using an inefficient algorithm.** The naive algorithm for counting palindromes is to iterate over all possible substrings of the input string, and check each one to see if it is a palindrome. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string. There are more efficient algorithms for counting palindromes, such as the Manacher algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n).
3. **Not handling special cases correctly.** The input string may contain special characters, such as spaces or punctuation marks. A developer must make sure to handle these characters correctly, or they may incorrectly count some palindromes or miss others.
4. **Using incorrect data types.** The input string may contain characters that are not representable in the data type that the developer is using. For example, a developer might use a char array to store the input string, but this would not work if the string contains characters outside of the ASCII range. A developer must make sure to use the correct data type for the input string, or they may encounter errors.

2. **Off-by-one errors.** The code may incorrectly calculate the number of problems that Rhezo can solve, or the total number of points he can earn. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as forgetting to add or subtract one from a calculation.
3. **Incorrect use of loops.** The code may use a loop incorrectly, such as iterating over the list of problems more than once or not iterating over it at all. This can lead to errors in the output.
4. **Incorrect use of conditional statements.** The code may use a conditional statement incorrectly, such as checking for a condition that is not true or not checking for a condition that is true. This can lead to errors in the output.
5. **Incorrect use of functions.** The code may call a function incorrectly, such as passing the wrong arguments or not calling the function at all. This can lead to errors in the output.
6. **Incorrect use of variables.** The code may use a variable incorrectly, such as assigning the wrong value to the variable or not using the variable at all. This can lead to errors in the output.
7. **Logical errors.** The code may contain logical errors, such as assuming that a certain condition is true when it is not or vice versa. This can lead to errors in the output.
8. **Performance problems.** The code may be inefficient, which can lead to slow execution times. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as using unnecessary loops or functions, or not using the right data structures.
9. **Security vulnerabilities.** The code may contain security vulnerabilities, such as allowing users to input arbitrary data or not properly validating user input. This can lead to attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or SQL injection.

ATCODER p02709 AtCoder Beginner Contest 163 - Active Infants

Pain points:
**1. Not considering the edge cases**

The problem states that `N >= 2`, but the following code will not work for `N == 1`.

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(sum(a))
```

**2. Not handling negative numbers correctly**

The problem states that `1 <= A_i <= 10^9`, but the following code will not work for `A_i < 0`.

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(sum(a))
```

**3. Using the wrong data type**

The problem states that `1 <= A_i <= 10^9`, but the following code will not work for large values of `A_i`.

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(sum(a))
```

**4. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The following code uses a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem, which is not very efficient.

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        ans = max(ans, a[i] * abs(i - j))
print(ans)
```

A more efficient algorithm would be to sort the array of activeness values and then iterate over the array, adding the product of the current value and the distance from the beginning of the array to the current value.

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
a.sort()
ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    ans += a[i] * (i + 1)

Title:
ATCODER p02838 AtCoder Beginner Contest 147 - Xor Sum 4

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is an array of integers. If we use an integer type to store the elements of the array, we may get an overflow error when the sum of the elements is too large. To avoid this, we can use a long long type to store the elements of the array.

**2. Using the wrong formula**

The XOR operation is defined as follows:

```
A ^ B = (A + B) mod 2
```

So, the sum of the XORs of all pairs of elements in the array is equal to the sum of all elements in the array modulo 2. To find the sum of the XORs of all pairs of elements in the array, we can use the following formula:

```
sum(A ^ B) = (sum(A) + sum(B)) mod 2
```

**3. Not using the modulo operator**

The output of the problem is a number modulo (10^9+7). To get the correct answer, we need to use the modulo operator when performing calculations.

**4. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

The input data is an array of integers. The first element of the array is the number of elements in the array. We need to make sure that the number of elements in the array is at least 2. Otherwise, the sum of the XORs of all pairs of elements in the array will be 0.

**5. Not handling overflow errors**

The sum of the XORs of all pairs of elements in the array can be very large. If we do not handle overflow errors, we may get an incorrect answer.

**6. Not using efficient algorithms**

The problem can be solved in O(N) time using a simple algorithm. However, we can improve the efficiency of the algorithm by using a more efficient data structure.
Test inputs:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int N;
    cin >> N;

    vector<long long> A(N);

        cin >> A[i];
    }

    long long sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        sum += A[i];

l_1, l_2 = map(int, input().split())

if l_1 >= A and l_2 >= B:

if N == 2:
    if l_1 >= A and l_2 >= B:

        print(10)
    else:
        print(20)
else:
    print("Incorrect input")
```

**2. Using the wrong data type.** The input data is given as integers, but the following code would incorrectly cast the data as strings:

```
N = int(input())
A, B, C = map(str, input().split())
l_1, l_2 = map(str, input().split())

if l_1 >= A and l_2 >= B:

**3. Not handling invalid input correctly.** The input data may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers that are too large. The following code would incorrectly crash if the input data is invalid:

```
N = int(input())
A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
l_1, l_2 = map(int, input().split())

if l_1 >= A and l_2 >= B:
    print(0)
elif l_1 >= A and l_2 >= C:
    print(10)
elif l_1 >= B and l_2 >= C:
    print(10)
else:
    print(20)
```

The correct code would be:

```
N = int(input())
A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
l_1, l_2 = map(int, input().split())

if N < 3 or A < C or B < C or l_1 < 1 or l_2 < 1:
    print("Incorrect input")
else:
    if l_1 >= A and l_2 >= B:
        print(0)
    elif l_1 >= A and l_2 >= C:
        print(10)
    elif l_1 >= B and l_2 >= C:
        print(10)
    else:
        print(20)
```

**4. Not using the correct algorithm.** The following code would incorrectly solve the problem:

```
N = int(input())
A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
l_1, l_2 = map(int, input().split())

if l_1 >= A and l_2 >= B:
    print(0)

ATCODER p03258 AtCoder Grand Contest 027 - ABBreviate

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) should be used to ensure that the result is a non-negative integer. For example, `10 % 3` is 1, not -1.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** Be careful when counting the number of elements in a list or array. For example, `len([1, 2, 3])` is 3, not 4.
3. **Incorrect use of Boolean operators.** The operators `and` and `or` have different precedence than you might expect. For example, `x and y or z` is equivalent to `(x and y) or z`, not `x and (y or z)`.
4. **Incorrect use of parentheses.** Parentheses can be used to group expressions together and to change the order of operations. For example, `(x + y) * z` is equivalent to `x * y + z`, not `x + (y * z)`.
5. **Undefined variables.** Be careful when using variables that have not been initialized. For example, `print(x)` will cause an error if `x` has not been assigned a value.
6. **Unintended side effects.** Be careful when using functions that have side effects, such as `print()`. These functions can change the state of your program, which can lead to unexpected results.
7. **Incorrect use of exceptions.** Exceptions can be used to handle errors that occur during program execution. However, be careful not to use exceptions to suppress errors that should be handled.
8. **Security vulnerabilities.** Be careful when writing code that is exposed to untrusted input. For example, you should always sanitize user input before using it in your code.

ATCODER p03414 AtCoder Regular Contest 092 - Two Faced Edges

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the number of vertices `N` is not a positive integer.

**2. Malformed input data**

The input data is malformed. For example, the number of edges `M` is negative.

**3. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not strictly followed. For example, the output does not contain `same` or `diff`.

**4. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve the problem is incorrect. For example, the algorithm does not correctly count the number of strongly connected components in the graph.

**5. Runtime error**

The algorithm used to solve the problem runs into a runtime error. For example, the algorithm runs out of memory.

**6. Time limit exceeded**

The algorithm used to solve the problem does not finish running within the time limit.

Title:
ATCODER p03574 AtCoder Beginner Contest 075 - Minesweeper

Pain points:
**1. Misunderstanding the problem statement**. The problem statement is not very clear, so it is easy to misunderstand what it is asking you to do. For example, you might think that you need to count the number of bombs in each row and column, or that you need to count the number of bombs in each 3x3 square.
2. **Incorrectly implementing the solution**. Once you understand the problem statement, you need to come up with a solution. This can be tricky, especially if you are not familiar with graph algorithms. There are a few different ways to solve this problem, but the most common is to use a breadth-first search (BFS).
3. **Not handling corner cases correctly**. The problem statement mentions that the grid can be of any size, up to 50x50. This means that you need to handle corner cases where the grid is not square, or where the grid has no empty squares.
4. **Using inefficient data structures**. The problem statement does not specify any restrictions on the data structures that you can use, so it is tempting to use inefficient data structures like arrays or linked lists. However, this can lead to a very slow solution.
5. **Not using memoization**. Memoization is a technique that can be used to speed up recursive algorithms. This technique can be used to avoid recomputing the same subproblems over and over again.
6. **Not using parallelism**. If the grid is large, you can use parallelism to speed up the computation. This can be done by dividing the grid into smaller subgrids and computing the number of bombs in each subgrid in parallel.

Title:
ATCODER p03729 AtCoder Beginner Contest 060 - Shiritori

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input strings are all composed of lowercase English letters, so they should be represented as strings. However, if the developer accidentally uses the wrong data type, such as integers, the program will not be able to correctly process the input and will produce incorrect results.

**2. Forgetting to check for the empty string**

The input strings can be empty. If the developer does not check for this case, the program will crash when it tries to access the first or last character of an empty string.

**3. Using incorrect comparison operators**

The program must compare the last character of A with the first character of B and the last character of B with the first character of C. If the developer uses the wrong comparison operator, such as `<` or `>`, the program will produce incorrect results.

**4. Not handling invalid input correctly**

The input strings must be valid. If the developer does not handle invalid input correctly, the program will crash or produce incorrect results.

**5. Using inefficient algorithms**

The program can be improved by using more efficient algorithms. For example, the program can use a hash table to store the characters in each string. This will allow the program to quickly check if the last character of A is the same as the first character of B and the last character of B is the same as the first character of C.

Title:
ATCODER p03893 CODE FESTIVAL 2016 Relay (Parallel) - Trichotomy

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the recursive function**

The recursive function `f(n)` should return the maximum number of times the operation can be performed on a cord with length `n`. However, if the implementation is incorrect, it may return an incorrect value. For example, the following implementation of `f(n)` will return `0` for all values of `n`:

```
def f(n):
  return 0
```

**2. Using an incorrect base case**

The base case of the recursive function should be the case where the length of the cord is 1 or 2. However, if the base case is incorrect, it may cause the function to enter an infinite loop. For example, the following implementation of `f(n)` will enter an infinite loop for all values of `n`:

```
def f(n):
  if n == 1 or n == 2:
    return n
  else:
    return f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)
```

**3. Using an incorrect stopping condition**

The recursive function should stop iterating when the length of the cord becomes 1 or 2. However, if the stopping condition is incorrect, it may cause the function to continue iterating even after the cord has reached its minimum length. For example, the following implementation of `f(n)` will continue iterating even after the cord has reached length 1:

```
def f(n):
  while n > 2:
    n = n - 1
  return n
```

**4. Using an incorrect return value**

The recursive function should return the maximum number of times the operation can be performed on a cord with length `n`. However, if the return value is incorrect, it may cause the program to produce incorrect output. For example, the following implementation of `f(n)` will return the wrong value for all values of `n`:

```
def f(n):
  return n + 1
```

**5. Using an incorrect data type**

The recursive function should use the correct data type to store the length of the cord. However, if the data type is incorrect, it may cause the function to produce incorrect output. For example, the following implementation of `f(n)` will produce incorrect output for all values of `n` that are greater than 255:

```
def f(n):
  return n // 255

ATCODER p04052 AtCoder Grand Contest 001 - Wide Swap

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors. For example, if the input is "4 2\n4 2 3 1", the program may not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong type, which may lead to errors. For example, if the input is "4 2\n4 5 7 8 3 1 2 6", the program may try to parse the input as integers, but it will fail because the input contains characters.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program may contain errors in its logic, which may lead to incorrect output. For example, the program may not consider all possible cases when swapping elements.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. The program may be implemented incorrectly, which may lead to errors. For example, the program may not use the correct data structures or algorithms.
5. **Incorrect testing**. The program may not be tested thoroughly, which may lead to errors that are not caught until the program is deployed in production.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully follow the input format, use the correct data types, check for errors in the logic, implement the program correctly, and test the program thoroughly.

Title:
AIZU p00451 Common Sub-String

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of string comparison operators.** The `==` operator compares the **values** of two strings, while the `===` operator compares the **references** of two strings. This can lead to errors if you are not careful. For example, the following code will return `true` even if `s1` and `s2` are not equal:

```
if (s1 == s2) {
  // Do something
}
```

The correct way to compare strings is to use the `===` operator.

2. **Using the wrong data type.** When working with strings, it is important to use the correct data type. For example, if you are trying to compare two strings, you should use the `String` data type, not the `char` data type.

3. **Not handling invalid input.** The input to your program may not always be valid. For example, the input may contain a string that is not a valid UTF-8 string. In these cases, you should handle the invalid input gracefully.

4. **Not using error handling.** Your program should be able to handle errors gracefully. For example, if your program encounters an error while reading from the input, it should print an error message and exit.

5. **Not using unit tests.** Unit tests are an important way to ensure that your program is working correctly. You should write unit tests for your program to catch any bugs early.

AIZU p01051 Squid Ink

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrectly calculating the number of seconds it takes to move to the desired position.** This could be caused by forgetting to take into account the time it takes to move through walls or to spit squid ink.
* **Misunderstanding the rules of the game.** For example, it is important to know that you cannot move to a square with enemy squid ink on it.
* **Making a mistake in your code.** This could be caused by a typo or by forgetting to account for a special case.
* **Not testing your code thoroughly.** This is important to ensure that your code works correctly for all possible inputs.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly calculating the number of seconds it takes to move to the desired position.** For example, a developer might forget to take into account the time it takes to move through walls or to spit squid ink. This could result in an incorrect answer being returned.
* **Misunderstanding the rules of the game.** For example, a developer might not realize that you cannot move to a square with enemy squid ink on it. This could result in the developer trying to move to a square that is not reachable, which would cause an error.
* **Making a mistake in your code.** This could be caused by a typo or by forgetting to account for a special case. For example, a developer might forget to check if the desired position is within the bounds of the battlefield. This could result in an error being thrown.
* **Not testing your code thoroughly.** This is important to ensure that your code works correctly for all possible inputs. For example, a developer might not test their code with inputs that include walls or enemy squid ink. This could result in the developer not finding a bug that would only occur in these cases.

Title:
AIZU p01488 TransferTrain

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not specified in the problem statement. A developer may incorrectly assume that the input format is a list of lists, where each inner list contains the departure and arrival stations of a train. This would lead to a parsing error when the input contains a list of strings instead of a list of lists.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the total distance.** The total distance traveled by a train is the sum of the distances between each pair of consecutive stations. A developer may incorrectly calculate the total distance by adding the distances between all stations, including the departure and arrival stations. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of transfers.** The minimum number of transfers required to travel from one station to another is the minimum number of edges in a shortest path between the two stations in the graph. A developer may incorrectly calculate the minimum number of transfers by counting the number of edges in a path that does not necessarily represent a shortest path. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect handling of negative distances.** The distances between stations may be negative. A developer may incorrectly assume that all distances are positive, which would lead to an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect handling of duplicate edges.** The graph may contain duplicate edges. A developer may incorrectly assume that the graph does not contain duplicate edges, which would lead to an incorrect answer.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is also not described clearly. For example, it is not clear whether the output should be a single integer or a list of integers. This can lead to errors when printing the output.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

The problem statement states that the upper-left cell is denoted as (1, 1), and the lower-right cell is denoted as (W, H). However, it is easy to make a mistake and start the indexing at (0, 0). This can lead to errors when calculating the coordinates of the cells.

**4. Incorrect boundary checks**

The problem statement states that the height and width of the grid must be between 1 and 50. However, it is easy to make a mistake and accidentally allow a grid with a larger size. This can lead to errors when accessing the elements of the grid.

**5. Incorrect data types**

The problem statement states that the cells of the grid can be either free (denoted by `.`), occupied by rocks (denoted by `#`), or contain jewels (denoted by lowercase alphabets) or holes (denoted by uppercase alphabets). However, it is easy to make a mistake and accidentally use the wrong data type for one of these values. This can lead to errors when processing the data.

**6. Incorrect logic**

The problem statement is not very clear about the rules for placing jewels and holes. For example, it is not clear whether you can place a jewel in a cell that already contains a jewel. This can lead to errors when implementing the solution.

**7. Unclear problem statement**

The problem statement is not very clear about the overall goal of the problem. For example, it is not clear what happens if you cannot reach the cell (W, H). This can lead to confusion and errors when solving the problem.

Title:
AIZU p01801 Wall Making Game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is "N M", where N and M are the number of rows and columns of the board, respectively. If the input format is incorrect, the program should output an error message.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be "First" or "Second". If the output format is incorrect, the program should output an error message.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When checking if a cell is surrounded by walls, it is important to make sure that the cell is not on the edge of the board. Otherwise, the program may incorrectly determine that the cell is surrounded by walls.
4. **Incorrect wall placement**. When placing walls, it is important to make sure that the walls do not overlap. Otherwise, the program may incorrectly determine that the game is over.
5. **Infinite loops**. The program should not get stuck in an infinite loop. If the program does get stuck in an infinite loop, it should output an error message.
6. **Memory leaks**. The program should not leak memory. If the program does leak memory, it could eventually crash.

## Possible Problems and Bugs

1. **Off-by-one errors**. When calculating the product of two numbers, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, if you are calculating `123 * 456`, you might accidentally calculate `123 * 457`. This can lead to incorrect answers.
2. **Arithmetic overflow**. When multiplying two large numbers, it is possible to overflow the integer type. For example, if you are multiplying two 32-bit integers, the product may be too large to fit in a 32-bit integer. This can lead to incorrect answers or even crashes.
3. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers**. Floating-point numbers are often used to represent real numbers, but they can be inaccurate and imprecise. This can lead to incorrect answers.
4. **Incorrect use of pointers**. Pointers can be a powerful tool, but they can also be dangerous. If you use pointers incorrectly, you can corrupt your data or even crash your program.
5. **Incorrect use of memory**. Memory is a precious resource, and it is important to use it wisely. If you allocate too much memory, you can slow down your program or even crash it. If you allocate too little memory, you can cause your program to crash.
6. **Incorrect use of threads**. Threads can be a powerful tool, but they can also be difficult to use correctly. If you use threads incorrectly, you can cause your program to deadlock or race condition.
7. **Incorrect use of synchronization**. Synchronization is essential for ensuring that multiple threads can access shared data safely. If you use synchronization incorrectly, you can cause your program to deadlock or race condition.
8. **Incorrect use of exceptions**. Exceptions can be a powerful tool, but they can also be dangerous. If you use exceptions incorrectly, you can cause your program to crash or behave in an unexpected way.
9. **Incorrect use of logging**. Logging is essential for debugging and troubleshooting problems. If you use logging incorrectly, you can make it difficult to diagnose problems.
10. **Incorrect use of unit testing**. Unit testing is essential for ensuring that your code is correct. If you use unit testing incorrectly, you can give yourself a false sense of security.

## How to Avoid These Problems

1. **Use a programming language that has good type safety**. This will help to prevent off-by-one errors and arithmetic overflows.
2. **Use a library that provides floating-point arithmetic**. This will help to ensure that your floating-point calculations are accurate and precise.
3. **Use pointers carefully**. Make sure that you understand the lifetime and ownership of pointers, and that you use them correctly.
4. **Use memory wisely**. Allocate only as much memory as you need, and free memory when you are finished with it.
5. **Use threads carefully**. Make sure that you understand the threading model of your programming language, and that you use threads correctly.
6. **Use synchronization carefully**. Make sure that you use synchronization to protect shared data, and that you use it correctly.
7. **Use exceptions carefully**. Only throw exceptions when there is truly an error, and make sure that you catch and handle exceptions gracefully.
8. **Use logging carefully**. Only log information that is relevant to debugging, and make sure that your log messages are clear and concise.
9. **Use unit testing carefully**. Make sure that your unit tests are comprehensive and that they cover all of the important code paths.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving programming problems.

Title:
AIZU p02216 Array Game

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrectly implementing the game rules.** The game rules are fairly complex, so it is important to make sure that you understand them correctly before you start coding. A common mistake is to forget that the players can only decrement the values of positive terms in the sequence. Another common mistake is to forget that the players can only decrement the values of all terms in the sequence if all of the terms are positive.
2. **Incorrectly implementing the game tree.** The game tree is a key part of the solution to this problem. It is important to make sure that you correctly implement the game tree so that you can find the optimal moves for each player. A common mistake is to forget to include all of the possible moves in the game tree. Another common mistake is to make incorrect assumptions about the values of the terms in the sequence.
3. **Incorrectly choosing the optimal move.** Once you have implemented the game tree, you need to be able to choose the optimal move for each player. This can be a difficult task, as there are often many possible moves to choose from. A common mistake is to choose a move that is not optimal. Another common mistake is to forget to consider the effects of your move on your opponent's future moves.

**Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:**

* **Read the problem statement carefully and make sure that you understand the game rules.**
* **Draw a diagram of the game tree to help you visualize the possible moves.**
* **Test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct.**
* **Ask for help from a mentor or teacher if you are stuck.**

Title:
AIZU p02369 Cycle Detection for a Directed Graph

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the DFS algorithm**

The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that can be used to find cycles in a directed graph. However, if the implementation of the DFS algorithm is incorrect, it may not be able to find all cycles in the graph. For example, the following implementation of the DFS algorithm will not be able to find all cycles in the graph:

```
def dfs(graph, node, visited):
  visited[node] = True
  for neighbor in graph[node]:
    if not visited[neighbor]:
      dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)

def find_cycles(graph):
  visited = [False] * len(graph)
  for node in range(len(graph)):
    if not visited[node]:
      dfs(graph, node, visited)

# This implementation of the DFS algorithm will not be able to find all cycles in the graph because it does not check if a node has already been visited. This means that it may miss cycles that contain a node that has already been visited.

2. **Incorrectly handling cycles**

Another common mistake that developers make when solving this problem is to incorrectly handle cycles. For example, the following implementation of the DFS algorithm will incorrectly handle cycles:

```
def dfs(graph, node, visited):
  visited[node] = True
  for neighbor in graph[node]:
    if not visited[neighbor]:
      dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)
    else:
      # This code will incorrectly mark the cycle as a back edge.
      graph[node].append(neighbor)

def find_cycles(graph):
  visited = [False] * len(graph)
  for node in range(len(graph)):
    if not visited[node]:
      dfs(graph, node, visited)

# This implementation of the DFS algorithm will incorrectly handle cycles because it will mark a cycle as a back edge if any of the nodes in the cycle have already been visited. This means that it will not be able to find all cycles in the graph.

3. **Using an incorrect data structure**

The final common mistake that developers make when solving this problem is to use an incorrect data structure. For example, the following implementation of the DFS algorithm will use an incorrect data structure:

```
def dfs(graph, node, visited):
  visited[node] = True
  for neighbor in graph[node]:
    if not visited[neighbor]:
      dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)

def find_cycles(graph):
  visited = [False] * len(graph)
  for node in range(len(graph)):
    if not visited[node]:
      dfs(graph, node, visited)

# This implementation of the DFS algorithm will use an incorrect data structure because it will use a list to store the visited nodes. This means that it will not be able to handle cycles correctly.

To avoid these mistakes, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements. It is also important to carefully implement the DFS algorithm and to correctly handle cycles. Finally, it is important to use the correct data structure to store the visited nodes.
