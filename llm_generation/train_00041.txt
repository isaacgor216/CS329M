Title:
CODECHEF cieltomy

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input is a list of integers, but the code is expecting a list of strings. This can be fixed by changing the type of the variable `input` to `list`.
2. **Incorrect variable name**. The variable `i` is used to iterate over the list of integers, but it is also used as the index of the list. This can be fixed by changing the name of the variable `i` to something else, such as `index`.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code is checking if the current element of the list is equal to the previous element. This is not necessary, as the list is already sorted.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The code is adding 1 to the index of the list when it should be adding 0. This can be fixed by changing the line `index += 1` to `index++`.
5. **Unnecessary code**. The code is using the `len()` function to get the length of the list, but this is not necessary. The code can simply iterate over the list until it reaches the end.
6. **Inefficient code**. The code is iterating over the list of integers twice. This can be reduced to one iteration by using a list comprehension.

Here is the correct code:
```
def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        roads = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        roads.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])
        count = 0
        for i in range(m):
            if roads[i][0] == 1 and roads[i][1] == n:
                count += 1
        print(count)

Title:
CODECHEF fact25

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect formula**

The factorial of a number n is defined as the product of all the integers from 1 to n. So, the factorial of 5 is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120. However, some developers may mistakenly use the formula n! = n * (n - 1)! to calculate factorials. This will lead to incorrect results for numbers greater than 4.

**2. Using an incorrect data type**

The factorial of a number can be very large, especially for large numbers. For example, the factorial of 100 is 9332621544394415268169923885626670049071596826438162146852. If you try to store this number in a variable of type int, you will get an overflow error.

**3. Not handling negative numbers**

The factorial of a negative number is not defined. Some developers may try to calculate the factorial of a negative number, which will lead to a runtime error.

**4. Not handling zero**

The factorial of zero is 1. Some developers may forget to handle this case, which will lead to an incorrect result.

**5. Using an inefficient algorithm**

The factorial of a number can be calculated using a recursive algorithm. However, this algorithm is very inefficient for large numbers. A more efficient algorithm is to use the following formula:

```
n! = (n + 1)! / (n + 1)
```

**6. Using floating-point arithmetic**

Floating-point arithmetic is not always accurate. This can lead to rounding errors when calculating factorials. To avoid this, you should use integer arithmetic whenever possible.

**7. Not using memoization**

Memoization is a technique that can be used to speed up the calculation of factorials. Memoization stores the results of previously calculated factorials, so that they do not need to be recalculated. This can significantly improve the performance of factorial calculations.

Title:
CODECHEF lch15jab

Pain points:
1. The developer may not correctly understand the problem. For example, they may think that the problem is asking for the number of occurrences of each character in the string, rather than the number of occurrences of a single character.
2. The developer may not correctly implement the solution. For example, they may use a brute-force approach that is inefficient, or they may make a mistake in their algorithm.
3. The developer may not correctly test their solution. For example, they may only test their solution on a few small cases, or they may not test their solution on cases that are not covered by their assumptions.
4. The developer may not correctly document their solution. For example, they may not include a detailed explanation of the solution, or they may not include comments in their code.
5. The developer may not correctly submit their solution. For example, they may not submit their solution in the correct format, or they may not submit their solution on time.

Title:
CODECHEF permsuff

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input contains integers, so we need to use the correct data types to store them. For example, if we use `int` to store the size of the permutation, we may get a `ValueError` when the size is larger than `2147483647`.

**2. Using incorrect indexes**

The indexes of the elements in the permutation start from 1. So we need to make sure that we use the correct indexes when accessing the elements in the permutation. For example, if we try to access the element at index 0, we will get a `IndexError`.

**3. Not handling all possible cases**

The problem statement says that the goal is to obtain the permutation `P`. So we need to make sure that we handle all possible cases, even if they are not mentioned in the problem statement. For example, we need to handle the case where the permutation `P` is not a valid permutation.

**4. Using inefficient algorithms**

The problem can be solved in linear time. However, if we use an inefficient algorithm, we may get a TLE. For example, if we use a recursive algorithm to solve the problem, we may get a TLE.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it. This will help you to catch any bugs in your code. For example, you can test your code on some small test cases.

Title:
CODECHEF sticks

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect sorting of input array.** The input array should be sorted in ascending order. If it is not sorted, the maximum area of rectangle may not be found.
2. **Using incorrect formula to calculate the maximum area of rectangle.** The maximum area of rectangle is equal to the product of the longest two sticks.
3. **Using incorrect data type to store the length of sticks.** The length of sticks may be very large. If we use an integer to store the length of sticks, it may overflow. We should use a long long integer to store the length of sticks.
4. **Using incorrect algorithm to find the maximum area of rectangle.** The brute-force algorithm is too slow. We can use a more efficient algorithm, such as the greedy algorithm.
5. **Not handling corner cases.** We should handle corner cases, such as when the number of sticks is less than 4.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1054_C. Candies Distribution

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a number of children that is not an integer, or the input may contain a number of candies that is not an integer.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may not contain a single line, or the output may not contain the correct number of integers.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the candies**. The candies are not distributed correctly to the children. For example, the number of candies given to a child may be less than 1, or the number of candies given to a child may be greater than the total number of candies.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the l and r values**. The l and r values are not calculated correctly for the children. For example, the l value for a child may be greater than the number of children to the left of the child, or the r value for a child may be greater than the number of children to the right of the child.
5. **Incorrect reasoning about the problem**. The developer may not understand the problem correctly, and may therefore make incorrect assumptions about the input and output. For example, the developer may assume that the children are seated in a row from left to right, when in fact they may be seated in a row from right to left.
6. **Incorrect implementation of the solution**. The developer may implement the solution incorrectly, and may therefore produce incorrect results. For example, the developer may use a incorrect algorithm to calculate the candies, or the developer may use a incorrect algorithm to calculate the l and r values.
7. **Incorrect testing of the solution**. The developer may not test the solution correctly, and may therefore not find any bugs in the solution. For example, the developer may only test the solution on a small number of inputs, or the developer may not test the solution on inputs that are likely to cause bugs.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always strictly followed, and this can lead to errors. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect variable types.** The program may not be able to handle variables of the wrong type. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The program may contain logical errors that cause it to produce incorrect results. For example, if the program does not account for all possible cases, it may produce incorrect results.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** The program may produce incorrect results because it is off by one. For example, if the program calculates the number of days to buy all the microtransactions as 10, but the actual number of days is 11, the program will produce an incorrect result.
5. **Infinite loops.** The program may enter an infinite loop if it is not written correctly. For example, if the program contains a loop that does not have a terminating condition, it will enter an infinite loop.
6. **Memory leaks.** The program may leak memory if it does not free up memory that is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
7. **Race conditions.** The program may experience race conditions if it is not written correctly. A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even crashes.
8. **Deadlocks.** The program may deadlock if it is not written correctly. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can prevent any of the threads from making progress and can eventually lead to the program crashing.
9. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program may contain security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. For example, if the program does not properly sanitize user input, an attacker could inject malicious code into the program.
10. **Performance problems.** The program may run slowly or inefficiently if it is not written correctly. This can make the program unusable for users or even lead to the program crashing.

CODEFORCES 1184_D2. Parallel Universes (Hard)

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Off-by-one errors.** This is a common mistake that can occur when computing the length of the multiverse or the probability of an event occurring. Be careful to check your calculations carefully and make sure that you are not accidentally adding or subtracting one from a value.
2. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic.** Modulo arithmetic is a powerful tool that can be used to simplify calculations, but it is important to use it correctly. Make sure that you understand the rules of modulo arithmetic and that you are not accidentally performing calculations outside of the modulo range.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The input to this problem includes some edge cases that you need to be aware of. For example, if the multiverse is initially empty, the Doctor will always be at one of the ends. Be sure to handle these edge cases correctly.
4. **Incorrect use of recursion.** Recursion can be a powerful tool for solving problems, but it is important to use it correctly. Make sure that you understand the base case of your recursive function and that you are not accidentally calling the function with invalid arguments.
5. **Incorrect use of dynamic programming.** Dynamic programming is a powerful technique for solving problems that involve overlapping subproblems. Make sure that you understand the principle of dynamic programming and that you are not accidentally recomputing subproblems that have already been solved.

**Additional tips:**

* When solving this problem, it is helpful to draw a picture of the multiverse. This can help you to visualize the problem and to identify the important relationships between the different variables.
* It is also helpful to break the problem down into smaller subproblems. This can make the problem more manageable and easier to solve.
* Finally, it is important to test your code thoroughly. This will help you to identify and fix any bugs in your solution.

    # Find all pairs of teams that have not played a match.
    unplayed = set(range(1, n + 1)) - played

    # Assign each unplayed pair of teams a random result.
    for u, v in unplayed:
        if random.random() > 0.5:
            matches.append((u, v))
        else:
            matches.append((v, u))

    # Print the results of the matches.
    for u, v in matches:
        print(u, v)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This solution will not always produce the maximum possible beauty of the league. For example, if the input is `3 1 1 2`, the output of this solution will be `010 001 100`, which has a beauty of 3. However, the maximum possible beauty of the league is 4, which can be achieved by the following output: `0110 0001 1010`.

**4. Incorrect data**

The data may be incorrect. For example, the data may contain invalid numbers or duplicate entries.

**5. Runtime errors**

The solution may not run correctly due to runtime errors. For example, the following solution may run into a `MemoryError`:

```
def main():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    matches = []
    for _ in range(m):
        matches.append(list(map(int, input().split())))

    # Find all pairs of teams that have played a match.
    played = set()
    for u, v in matches:
        played.add((u, v))
        played.add((v, u))

    # Find all pairs of teams that have not played a match.
    unplayed = set(range(1, n + 1)) - played

    # Assign each unplayed pair of teams a random result.
    for u, v in unplayed:
        matches.append((u, v))

    # Print the results of the matches.
    for u, v in matches:
        print(u, v)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This solution will run out of memory because the `matches` list will grow too large.

**6. Time complexity**

The time complexity of the solution may be too high. For example, the following solution has a time complexity of `O(n^3)`:

```
def main():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    matches = []
    for _ in range(m):
        matches.append(list(map(int, input().split())))

    # Find all pairs of teams that have played a match.
    played = set()
    for u, v in matches:
        played.add((u, v))
        played.add((v, u))

    # Find all pairs of teams that have not played a match.
    unplayed = set(range(1, n + 1)) - played

    # Assign each unplayed pair

CODEFORCES 1286_B. Numbers on Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. The tree traversal algorithm should visit each vertex exactly once, and the order in which the vertices are visited should not matter.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the subtree size.** The subtree size of a vertex is the number of vertices that are descendants of that vertex. This includes the vertex itself, as well as all of its children, grandchildren, and so on.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum value in the subtree.** The minimum value in the subtree of a vertex is the smallest value that is written on any vertex in the subtree.
4. **Incorrect output of the solution.** The solution to this problem should consist of a single line containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where a_i is the value that is written on vertex i. The integers should be separated by spaces.
5. **Incorrect handling of special cases.** The input to this problem may contain special cases, such as a tree with no vertices or a tree with a single vertex. The solution must be able to handle these special cases correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1305_C. Kuroni and Impossible Calculation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulo operation.** When calculating the product of absolute values, it is important to take into account the fact that the modulo operation is not commutative. For example, `(a + b) % m` is not equal to `(b + a) % m`. This means that we cannot simply multiply the absolute values of the numbers and then take the modulo. Instead, we need to first calculate the product of the absolute values, and then divide by `m` and take the remainder.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over the numbers, it is easy to make a mistake and iterate one index too far or not far enough. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect use of the factorial function.** The factorial function is defined as `n! = 1 * 2 * ... * n`. However, it is important to remember that `0! = 1`. This means that if we are calculating the product of the absolute values of a set of numbers that includes zero, we need to add 1 to the result before taking the factorial.
4. **Incorrect use of the GCD function.** The GCD function (greatest common divisor) is defined as the largest integer that divides both numbers evenly. However, it is important to remember that the GCD of two numbers is never negative. This means that if we are calculating the GCD of two numbers, and one of the numbers is negative, we need to take the absolute value of that number before calculating the GCD.
5. **Incorrect use of the mod operator.** The mod operator (modulo) is used to find the remainder of a division operation. For example, `10 % 3` is equal to 1. However, it is important to remember that the mod operator is not commutative. For example, `10 % 3` is not equal to `3 % 10`. This means that we cannot simply swap the operands in a mod operation.
6. **Incorrect use of the bitwise operators.** The bitwise operators `&`, `|`, `^`, and `~` are used to perform bitwise operations on integers. However, it is important to remember that these operators only work on integers, and not on floating-point numbers.
7. **Incorrect use of the shift operators.** The shift operators `<<` and `>>` are used to shift the bits of an integer to the left or right. However, it is important to remember that these operators only work on integers, and not on floating-point numbers.
8. **Incorrect use of the logical operators.** The logical operators `&&`, `||`, and `!` are used to perform logical operations on boolean values. However, it is important to remember that these operators only work on boolean values, and not on integers or floating-point numbers.
9. **Incorrect use of the comparison operators.** The comparison operators `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` are used to compare two values. However, it is important to remember that these operators only work on values of the same type. For example, we cannot compare an integer to a floating-point number.
10. **Incorrect use of the assignment operator.** The assignment operator `=` is used to assign a value to a variable. However, it is important to remember that the assignment operator does not return a value. This means that we cannot use the assignment operator in an expression.

CODEFORCES 1329_E. Dreamoon Loves AA

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The input data may be of the wrong type. For example, the input may contain a string when it should contain a number. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** The program may forget to account for the first or last element in the input data. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The program may have incorrect logic, such as using the wrong formula to calculate the balance degree. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results.
5. **Memory leaks.** The program may not properly release memory that it has allocated. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions.** The program may not be thread-safe, which can lead to incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.
7. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program may contain security vulnerabilities, such as allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1349_E. Slime and Hats

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of players who have left the room.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. When a player leaves the room, all of the players behind him will know that he has left. So, if a player leaves in the $i$-th round, then all of the players in positions $i+1, i+2, \ldots, n$ will have left the room by the end of the $i$-th round.
2. **Not considering the order in which players leave the room.** The order in which players leave the room is important because it can affect the information that is available to other players. For example, if a player leaves the room in the $i$-th round, then all of the players in positions $i+1, i+2, \ldots, n$ will know that he has left. However, if a player leaves the room in the $j$-th round, where $j < i$, then the players in positions $i+1, i+2, \ldots, n$ will not know that he has left until the end of the $j$-th round.
3. **Not considering the information that is available to each player.** Each player knows the color of the hats of all of the players in front of him. So, if a player leaves the room, then all of the players behind him will know the color of his hat. However, the players in front of him will not know the color of his hat until after he leaves the room.
4. **Not using the information that is available to solve the problem.** The goal of the problem is to determine the color of each player's hat. To do this, we need to use the information that is available to us. This includes the number of players who have left the room, the order in which they left the room, and the information that is available to each player.
5. **Not handling special cases correctly.** There are a few special cases that need to be handled correctly in order to solve the problem. For example, what happens if a player leaves the room in the first round? What happens if a player leaves the room in the last round? What happens if there are no players in the room?

By avoiding these common problems, you can increase your chances of solving the problem correctly.

CODEFORCES 1534_E. Lost Array

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are following the format exactly. If you do not, you will get an incorrect answer.

For example, if you forget to put a space between the two numbers in the first line, or if you put a comma instead of a space, you will get an incorrect answer.

### 2. Invalid queries

Another common mistake is to make an invalid query. This can happen if you try to query more than k elements, or if you try to query elements that are not in the range 1 to n.

For example, if you try to query the elements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 on an array of size 3, you will get an invalid query.

### 3. Exceeding the query limit

The query limit for this problem is 500. If you make more than 500 queries, you will get a Wrong Answer verdict.

### 4. Not flushing the output

It is important to flush the output after each query. If you do not, you will get an Idleness limit exceeded error.

To flush the output, you can use the following code in C++:

```
cout << "? " << b << endl;
cout.flush();
```

### 5. Using the wrong data type

The input and output for this problem are all integers. It is important to make sure that you are using the correct data type for your variables.

For example, if you try to store the XOR sum of an array of integers in a variable of type float, you will get an incorrect answer.

### 6. Using the wrong algorithm

The optimal algorithm for solving this problem is to use a divide and conquer approach. This involves recursively splitting the array in half and then querying the XOR sum of the two halves.

If you use a different algorithm, you will likely get an incorrect answer.

Title:
CODEFORCES 162_B. Binary notation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly converting the input to an integer.** The input is a string, so it must be converted to an integer before it can be used in calculations. If this is not done correctly, the program will produce incorrect results.
2. **Using an incorrect algorithm to convert the integer to binary.** There are many different algorithms for converting an integer to binary, and not all of them are correct. The most common mistake is to use a recursive algorithm, which can lead to stack overflow errors. A better approach is to use a iterative algorithm, such as the one described in the following article: [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-an-integer-to-binary-in-c/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-an-integer-to-binary-in-c/)
3. **Incorrectly printing the binary output.** The binary output must be printed without any leading zeros. This can be done by using the `%0*d` format specifier, where `*` is the number of digits to print. For example, to print the binary representation of the number 5, you would use the following code:

```
printf(" %08d ", n);
```

4. **Not handling negative integers.** The problem statement specifies that the input must be a positive integer. If a negative integer is input, the program will produce incorrect results. To avoid this problem, the program should check the sign of the input and return an error if it is negative.

5. **Not handling invalid input.** The problem statement specifies that the input must be an integer between 1 and 106. If an invalid input is entered, the program should return an error. To do this, the program can use the `isdigit()` function to check if the input is a valid digit. If it is not, the program should return an error.

CODEFORCES 181_C. Trading Business

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always followed correctly. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or it may contain a string that is not a planet name. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not always followed correctly. For example, the output may contain a number that is not an integer, or it may contain a string that is not a profit. If the output format is incorrect, the program will crash.

**3. Incorrect calculation of profit**

The profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of buying items from the cost of selling items. However, the cost of buying and selling items may not be calculated correctly. For example, the cost of buying an item may be negative, or the cost of selling an item may be greater than the cost of buying an item. If the profit is calculated incorrectly, the program will give an incorrect answer.

**4. Incorrect handling of overflow**

The cost of buying and selling items may be very large. If these values are not handled correctly, the program may overflow and crash.

**5. Incorrect handling of underflow**

The cost of buying and selling items may be very small. If these values are not handled correctly, the program may underflow and crash.

**6. Incorrect handling of division by zero**

The cost of selling an item may be zero. If this value is not handled correctly, the program may divide by zero and crash.

CODEFORCES 204_E. Little Elephant and Strings

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program's execution. For example, if the input contains a space after the first integer, the program may not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect variable types**. The program may use incorrect variable types to store data, which can lead to errors in the program's execution. For example, if the program tries to store a string in an integer variable, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program may contain errors in its logic, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program tries to divide by zero, the program will crash.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The program may make off-by-one errors, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program iterates over a list of numbers, but starts at the wrong index, the program will miss some of the numbers.
5. **Memory leaks**. The program may not properly free memory that it has allocated, which can lead to a memory leak. A memory leak can eventually cause the program to crash.
6. **Race conditions**. The program may not be thread-safe, which can lead to errors if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may contain security vulnerabilities, which can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program's data or system.

Title:
CODEFORCES 489_C. Given Length and Sum of Digits...

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input contains two integers, so the developer should use `int` or `long` to store them. Using a smaller data type (such as `short`) may lead to incorrect results.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The problem statement asks to find the smallest and the largest numbers that have a given length and sum of digits. A naive solution would be to iterate over all possible numbers and find the ones that satisfy the given conditions. However, this approach is very inefficient and will not work for large values of `m` and `s`.

A more efficient solution is to use dynamic programming. The idea is to build a table that stores the smallest and the largest numbers that can be formed using the first `i` digits and a sum of `j` digits. This table can be used to find the smallest and the largest numbers that satisfy the given conditions in O(m) time.

**3. Incorrect output format**

The output should contain two numbers, separated by a space. The numbers should be non-negative integers written in the decimal base without leading zeroes.

**4. Missing boundary checks**

The input may contain invalid values, such as `m < 1` or `s < 0`. The developer should check for these values and handle them appropriately.

**5. Other bugs**

There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. Some common examples include:

* Using incorrect variable names
* Forgetting to initialize variables
* Using incorrect operators
* Making logical errors

It is important to carefully review the code and test it thoroughly to avoid these types of bugs.

CODEFORCES 630_F. Selection of Personnel

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the only line of the input should contain one integer. If the input contains anything else, the program will not be able to process it correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the output should be one integer. If the output contains anything else, the program will not be accepted by the judge.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of possible group compositions.** The number of possible group compositions can be calculated using the following formula:

```
nCk = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)
```

where n is the number of potential employees and k is the number of employees in the group. However, if the value of k is greater than n, the number of possible group compositions will be zero.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the number of possible group compositions, it is important to make sure that the upper bound on k is correct. For example, if n = 7, the upper bound on k is 6, not 7.
5. **Arithmetic errors.** When calculating the number of possible group compositions, it is important to make sure that the calculations are performed correctly. For example, if n = 7 and k = 5, the number of possible group compositions is 25, not 29.

Title:
CODEFORCES 658_C. Bear and Forgotten Tree 3

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly and that you are not missing or adding any characters. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the input will be interpreted incorrectly.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also very specific. It is important to make sure that you are printing the output in the correct format. For example, if you forget to put a space between two numbers, the output will be incorrect.

**3. Using the wrong data type**

The problem statement specifies that the input and output should be integers. It is important to make sure that you are using the correct data type for your variables. For example, if you try to store a number as a string, the program will not work correctly.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

One common mistake that programmers make is off-by-one errors. This happens when you forget to add or subtract one from a number. For example, if you are trying to find the index of the last element in an array, you might accidentally start counting from 0 instead of 1. This will cause the program to output the wrong answer.

**5. Logical errors**

Logical errors are errors that occur when the program is not doing what you intended it to do. For example, if you are trying to write a program to find the largest element in an array, you might accidentally compare the elements in the wrong order. This will cause the program to output the wrong answer.

**6. Infinite loops**

Another common mistake that programmers make is creating infinite loops. This happens when the program enters a loop and never exits. For example, if you are trying to print all of the elements in an array, you might accidentally forget to add a condition to the loop that stops it from running forever. This will cause the program to crash.

**7. Memory leaks**

Memory leaks occur when a program allocates memory but never frees it. This can eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash. Memory leaks are often caused by forgetting to close files or sockets.

n = int(n)
d = int(d)
h = int(h)
```

**4. Off-by-one errors**

```
edges = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5]]
print(len(edges))
```

**5. Logical errors**

```
if h == 1:
    if d == n - 1:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(1, 2)
else:
    if d == h + 1:

        print(1, h + 1)
        for i in range(3, n):
            print(i, i + 1)
```

**6. Infinite loops**

```
while True:
    print(1)
```

**7. Memory leaks**

```
file = open('file.txt', 'w')
file.write('hello world')
file.close()
```
Title:
CODEFORCES 680_E. Bear and Square Grid

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the output contains a character that is not a digit, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input and output values must be correctly specified, or the program will crash. For example, if the input contains a string of characters that is supposed to be an integer, the program will crash.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the program misses or adds one element to a calculation. This can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program is supposed to find the sum of the first 100 integers, but it only adds the first 99 integers, the result will be incorrect.
5. **Indexing errors**. Indexing errors occur when the program accesses an element of an array or string that is out of bounds. This can lead to incorrect results or a crash. For example, if the program tries to access the 10th element of an array that only has 9 elements, the program will crash.
6. **Logic errors**. Logic errors occur when the program contains a logical flaw that causes it to produce incorrect results. For example, if the program is supposed to find the maximum value in an array, but it instead finds the minimum value, the result will be incorrect.
7. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when the program allocates memory that it does not free, which can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing. For example, if the program creates a new object but never deletes it, the program will eventually run out of memory and crash.
8. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more parts of the program try to access the same data at the same time, which can lead to incorrect results or a crash. For example, if two threads try to update the same variable at the same time, the variable's value may be incorrect.
9. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more parts of the program are waiting for each other to finish, which can lead to the program being stuck in an infinite loop. For example, if two threads are each waiting for the other thread to release a lock, the program will be stuck in an infinite loop.
10. **Unhandled exceptions**. Unhandled exceptions occur when the program encounters an error that it cannot handle, which can lead to the program crashing. For example, if the program tries to divide by zero, the program will crash.

CODEFORCES 703_D. Mishka and Interesting sum

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading in the data. For example, if you forget to add a space between two integers, the program will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect array indexing**. The array in this problem is indexed from 1 to n, but it's easy to make a mistake and index it from 0 to n-1. This will cause the program to output incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect use of XOR**. The XOR operator is a powerful tool, but it's easy to misuse it. For example, if you try to XOR two negative numbers, the result will be a negative number.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when you forget to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can cause the program to output incorrect results or crash.
5. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when a program allocates memory but doesn't free it when it's no longer needed. This can eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
6. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
7. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely.
8. **Stack overflows**. Stack overflows occur when a program tries to allocate more stack space than is available. This can cause the program to crash.
9. **Buffer overflows**. Buffer overflows occur when a program writes data to a buffer that is too small. This can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.
10. **Format string vulnerabilities**. Format string vulnerabilities occur when a program uses a format string incorrectly. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

CODEFORCES 794_D. Labelling Cities

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**

The input format is "n m" followed by "m lines". Each line contains "ui vi". If the input format is not correct, the program will crash.

**2. The output format is not correct**

The output format is "YES" or "NO" followed by "n space-separated integers". If the output format is not correct, the program will get a wrong answer.

**3. The program does not consider all possible cases**

The program should consider all possible cases. For example, if there are two cities A and B, and there is a road between them, then the labels of A and B should be 1 and 2, respectively. If the program does not consider this case, it will get a wrong answer.

**4. The program has a bug**

The program may have a bug. For example, the program may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. If the program has a bug, it will get a wrong answer.

CODEFORCES 815_C. Karen and Supermarket

Pain points:
**Possible Problems and Bugs**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is "1 2", the program may incorrectly parse it as "1 2 3", which would lead to an incorrect answer.
* **Incorrect data type:** The data type of the input values may be incorrect, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is "1 2.0", the program may incorrectly parse it as "1 2", which would lead to an incorrect answer.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic of the program may be incorrect, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may incorrectly check if the budget is sufficient to purchase a good, which would lead to an incorrect answer.
* **Off-by-one errors:** The program may make off-by-one errors, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may incorrectly count the number of goods that can be purchased, which would lead to an incorrect answer.
* **Memory leaks:** The program may leak memory, which can lead to performance problems. For example, the program may not free the memory allocated for the input values, which would lead to a memory leak.
* **Race conditions:** The program may have race conditions, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may not properly synchronize access to shared data, which could lead to a race condition.
* **Deadlocks:** The program may deadlock, which can prevent it from completing. For example, the program may have two threads that are waiting for each other to release a lock, which could lead to a deadlock.

**How to Avoid These Problems**

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully follow the input format, use the correct data types, write correct logic, and avoid off-by-one errors. It is also important to use memory-efficient algorithms and to avoid memory leaks and race conditions. Finally, it is important to test the program thoroughly to catch any bugs that may be present.

Title:
CODEFORCES 840_C. On the Bench

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**

The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. For example, 10 % 3 = 1. This means that 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.

In the problem statement, we are asked to find the number of right permutations modulo 109 + 7. This means that we need to find the remainder when the number of right permutations is divided by 109 + 7.

However, some developers may accidentally use the modulo operator incorrectly. For example, they might write something like this:

```
number_of_right_permutations % 109 + 7
```

This is incorrect because the modulo operator (%) only returns the remainder of a division. In this case, the division will never terminate because 109 + 7 is not a factor of the number of right permutations.

To avoid this problem, you should always use the correct modulo operator, which is ```pow(10, 9) + 7```.

**2. Using the wrong data type**

The problem statement specifies that the length of the array is at most 300. This means that the values in the array can be at most 300.

However, some developers may accidentally use a data type that is too small to store these values. For example, they might use an integer to store the values in the array.

This is incorrect because an integer can only store values up to 2147483647. This means that if a value in the array is greater than 2147483647, it will be truncated.

To avoid this problem, you should always use a data type that is large enough to store the values in the array. In this case, you should use a long long integer.

**3. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem statement asks us to find the number of right permutations modulo 109 + 7. This means that we need to find the remainder when the number of right permutations is divided by 109 + 7.

One way to do this is to use the following algorithm:

1. Initialize a variable to 1.
2. For each element in the array, do the following:
    * Multiply the current value of the variable by the element.
    * If the product is greater than 109 + 7, then divide it by 109 + 7 and take the remainder.
3. Return the remainder of the final value of the variable.

This algorithm works correctly, but it is not very efficient. A more efficient algorithm is to use the following formula:

```
number_of_right_permutations = (n! * (1 - (1 / a1) * (1 / a2) * ... * (1 / an))) % (109 + 7)
```

where n is the length of the array and ai is the ith element of the array.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement does not specify any edge cases. However, there are a few edge cases that you should be aware of.

For example, the array could be empty. In this case, the number of right permutations is 1.

The array could also contain duplicate elements. In this case, the number of right permutations is the same as the number of permutations of the unique elements in the array.

You should always be aware of edge cases when solving problems. By handling edge cases correctly, you can avoid making mistakes.

CODEFORCES 860_D. Wizard's Tour

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program's output. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The data type of the input values may not be correctly specified, which can lead to errors in the program's output. For example, if the input contains a string that is supposed to be an integer, the program may crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors occur when the programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a program that prints the wrong number of lines of output.
4. **Logic errors.** Logic errors occur when the programmer makes a mistake in the logic of the program. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a program that does not find the correct solution to a problem.
5. **Memory errors.** Memory errors occur when the program allocates too much or too little memory. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
6. **Race conditions.** Race conditions occur when two or more parts of the program try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
7. **Synchronization errors.** Synchronization errors occur when two or more parts of the program try to access the same data at different times. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
8. **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks occur when two or more parts of the program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish because the other is waiting for it. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
9. **Security vulnerabilities.** Security vulnerabilities occur when the program is not secure enough to protect against malicious attacks. This can lead to the program being hacked or compromised, which can have serious consequences.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format, data types, and logic of the program. It is also important to test the program thoroughly to catch any errors that may have been missed during development.

CODEFORCES 931_F. Teodor is not a liar!

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is two integers: `n` and `m`, followed by `n` lines of input, each containing two integers `li` and `ri`. The integers `n` and `m` should be positive integers, and each of the `li` and `ri` should be between 1 and `m` inclusive. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer, which is the maximum number of questions that Sasha can ask Teodor without being able to be sure that Teodor is not lying. If the output format is incorrect, the program will crash.

**3. Overflow**

The maximum value of `m` is 100,000. If the program tries to allocate an array or other data structure that is larger than this, it will overflow and crash.

**4. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve this problem must be correct in order to get the correct answer. If the algorithm is incorrect, the program will output the wrong answer.

**5. Runtime error**

The program must be able to run within the time limit specified by the problem. If the program runs too slowly, it will time out and the submission will be marked as incorrect.

**6. Memory error**

Title:
CODEFORCES 959_A. Mahmoud and Ehab and the even-odd game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly checking if a number is even or odd.** A common mistake is to check if a number is even by dividing it by 2 and checking if the remainder is 0. However, this is not always correct, as the number 1 is even but has a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. To correctly check if a number is even, you can use the modulo operator (%), which returns the remainder of a division. For example, 1 % 2 is 1, which means that 1 is odd.
2. **Incorrectly computing the next move.** When determining the next move in the game, it is important to make sure that you are following the rules of the game. For example, if it is Mahmoud's turn and the current number is odd, he must choose an even number to subtract. If he chooses an odd number, he will lose the game.
3. **Not handling special cases correctly.** There are a few special cases that you need to be aware of when solving this problem. For example, if the current number is 0, Mahmoud cannot make a move and will lose the game.
4. **Using inefficient algorithms.** There are a few different ways to solve this problem, but some algorithms are more efficient than others. For example, you can use a binary search to find the next move, which is more efficient than simply iterating through all of the possible moves.
5. **Not testing your code thoroughly.** It is important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. This includes testing for all of the different possible inputs and edge cases.

Title:
CODEFORCES 985_F. Isomorphic Strings

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of loops**

One common mistake is to use the wrong type of loop for a given problem. For example, you might try to use a for loop to iterate over a list of strings, but this would not work because a for loop iterates over the elements of a list, not the indices. Instead, you would need to use a while loop.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

Another common mistake is to make an off-by-one error. This occurs when you forget to add or subtract one from a number when performing an arithmetic operation. For example, you might try to index into an array with a value that is one greater than the number of elements in the array, which would cause an error.

**3. Using the wrong data type**

Another common mistake is to use the wrong data type for a given problem. For example, you might try to store a number in a string, but this would not work because strings cannot store numbers. Instead, you would need to use a numeric data type such as an integer or a float.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

Another common mistake is to not handle edge cases. An edge case is a situation that is not explicitly handled by the code, and this can lead to errors. For example, you might not handle the case where a string is empty, which could cause an error.

**5. Using global variables**

Another common mistake is to use global variables. Global variables are variables that are accessible from anywhere in your code, and this can lead to problems. For example, you might accidentally change the value of a global variable from one part of your code, which could affect the behavior of other parts of your code.

**6. Not using comments**

Another common mistake is to not use comments. Comments are used to explain your code, and this can help other developers understand what your code is doing. Without comments, it can be difficult for other developers to understand your code, which can lead to errors.

**7. Not testing your code**

Another common mistake is to not test your code. Testing your code helps you to identify errors before they cause problems in production. By testing your code, you can increase the reliability of your code and reduce the number of errors that occur.

Title:
ATCODER p02710 AtCoder Beginner Contest 163 - path pass i

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the number of vertices N is not given on the first line.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The data type of the input is not correct. For example, the color of a vertex is given as a string instead of an integer.

**3. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not correct. For example, the number of paths is not printed on a separate line for each k.

**4. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve the problem is incorrect. For example, the algorithm does not take into account the fact that the graph is a tree.

**5. Runtime error**

The algorithm used to solve the problem runs into a runtime error. For example, the algorithm uses an unbounded amount of memory.

**6. Memory error**

The algorithm used to solve the problem runs into a memory error. For example, the algorithm allocates an unbounded amount of memory.

**7. Wrong answer**

Title:
ATCODER p02839 AtCoder Beginner Contest 147 - Balanced Path

Pain points:
**1. Input format is not correct**

The input format is not correct. The input should be in the following format:

```
H W
A_{11} A_{12} ... A_{1W}
...
A_{H1} A_{H2} ... A_{HW}
B_{11} B_{12} ... B_{1W}
...
B_{H1} B_{H2} ... B_{HW}
```

However, the input in the question is in the following format:

```
H W
A_{11} A_{12} ... A_{1W}
:
A_{H1} A_{H2} ... A_{HW}
B_{11} B_{12} ... B_{1W}
:
B_{H1} B_{H2} ... B_{HW}
```

This is not correct because the `:` characters are not present in the correct input format.

**2. Unbalancedness is not calculated correctly**

The unbalancedness is calculated as the absolute difference of the sum of red numbers and the sum of blue numbers written on the squares along Takahashi's path, including the squares (1, 1) and (H, W). However, the unbalancedness is not calculated correctly in the following code:

```
def unbalancedness(H, W, A, B):
    red = 0
    blue = 0
    for i in range(H):
        for j in range(W):
            if A[i][j] > B[i][j]:
                red += A[i][j] - B[i][j]
            else:
                blue += B[i][j] - A[i][j]
    return abs(red - blue)
```

This code does not take into account the squares (1, 1) and (H, W). To calculate the unbalancedness correctly, we need to add the values of A[0][0] and B[H-1][W-1] to red and blue, respectively.

**3. Takahashi's path is not constrained correctly**

Takahashi's path is constrained to be a path from the square (1, 1) to the square (H, W). However, the following code does not enforce this constraint:

```
def path(H, W, A, B):
    red = 0
    blue = 0
    for i in range(H):
        for j in range(W):
            if A[i][j] > B[i][j]:
                red += A[i][j] - B[i][j]
            else:
                blue += B[i][j] - A[i][j]
    return abs(red - blue)
```

This code allows Takahashi to travel from the square (1, 1) to the square (H, W) in any way he wants. This is not correct because Takahashi must not leave the grid.

**4. The minimum unbalancedness is not found**

The minimum unbalancedness is not found in the following code:

```
def find_min_unbalancedness(H, W, A, B):
    min_unbalancedness = float("inf")
    for i in range(H):
        for j in range(W):
            red = 0
            blue = 0
            for k in range(H):
                for l in range(W):
                    if A[k][l] > B[k][l]:
                        red += A[k][l] - B[k][l]
                    else:
                        blue += B[k][l] - A[k][l]
            min_unbalancedness = min(min_unbalancedness, abs(red - blue))
    return min_unbalancedness
```

This code does not iterate over all possible paths from the square (1, 1) to the square (H, W). To find the minimum unbalancedness, we need to iterate over all possible paths and find the path that results in the smallest unbalancedness.

Title:
ATCODER p02976 AtCoder Grand Contest 035 - Even Degrees

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect graph representation**. The graph is represented as an adjacency list, but the edges are not directed. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect use of the DFS algorithm**. The DFS algorithm is used to find all the connected components of the graph. However, if the graph is not connected, the DFS algorithm will not find all of the components.
3. **Incorrect use of the indegree and outdegree of a vertex**. The indegree and outdegree of a vertex are used to determine if the vertex has an even number of edges. However, if the graph is not connected, the indegree and outdegree of a vertex may not be correct.
4. **Incorrect handling of the case where the graph has an odd number of vertices**. If the graph has an odd number of vertices, it is not possible to assign directions to the edges so that every vertex has an even number of edges.
5. **Incorrect output format**. The output format for the solution is not correct. The solution should be a list of pairs of vertices, where each pair represents an edge in the directed graph.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the constraints. It is also important to use the correct data structures and algorithms to solve the problem. Finally, it is important to carefully check the output of the solution to make sure that it is correct.

Title:
ATCODER p03259 AtCoder Grand Contest 027 - Grafting

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of operations required.** The problem states that we need to find the minimum number of operations required to make A coincide with B, ignoring color. This means that we can ignore the color of the vertices and only focus on the structure of the trees. One common mistake is to count the number of operations required to make the two trees have the same number of leaves, even though this is not necessary.
2. **Not considering all possible cases.** The problem states that all given graphs are trees. This means that we can assume that the graphs are connected and acyclic. However, it is possible for two trees to be isomorphic even if they are not connected or acyclic. For example, the following two trees are isomorphic:

```
    1
   / \
  2   3

    1
   / \
  2   3
```

If we only consider connected and acyclic graphs, we will incorrectly conclude that these two trees are not isomorphic.
3. **Using incorrect data structures.** The problem states that each tree has N vertices numbered 1 to N. This means that we need to use a data structure that can store N vertices and their adjacencies. A common mistake is to use an array to store the adjacencies of each vertex. This is not a good choice because arrays are not efficient for storing sparse graphs. A better choice would be to use a hash table or a linked list.
4. **Making incorrect assumptions about the input.** The problem states that all given graphs are trees. This means that we can assume that the graphs are connected and acyclic. However, it is possible for the input to contain invalid graphs. For example, the following graph is invalid because it has a cycle:

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
  / \
 4   5
```

If we do not check for invalid graphs, our program will crash when it tries to process the input.
5. **Not handling errors correctly.** The problem states that all given graphs are trees. This means that we can assume that the graphs are connected and acyclic. However, it is possible for the input to contain invalid graphs. For example, the following graph is invalid because it has a negative edge weight:

```
    1
   / \
  2 - 3
```

If we do not handle errors correctly, our program will crash when it tries to process the input.

Title:
ATCODER p03415 AtCoder Beginner Contest 090 - Diagonal String

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is specified as follows:

```
c_{11}c_{12}c_{13}
c_{21}c_{22}c_{23}
c_{31}c_{32}c_{33}
```

However, a developer may accidentally input the format as follows:

```
c_{11}c_{12}c_{13}c_{21}c_{22}c_{23}c_{31}c_{32}c_{33}
```

This will cause the program to crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is specified as follows:

```
abc
```

However, a developer may accidentally output the format as follows:

```
a,b,c
```

This will cause the program to produce incorrect output.

**3. Mismatched input and output lengths**

The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a string of length 3. However, a developer may accidentally write code that produces an output of length 2 or 4. This will cause the program to produce incorrect output.

**4. Incorrect use of variables**

The program uses the variables `c11`, `c12`, `c13`, `c21`, `c22`, `c23`, `c31`, `c32`, and `c33` to store the input values. However, a developer may accidentally use these variables to store other values, such as the output values. This will cause the program to produce incorrect output.

**5. Logic errors**

The program uses the following logic to produce the output:

```
1. Iterate over the 3x3 grid, starting from the top-left corner.
2. For each square in the grid, add the letter in the square to the output string.
3. Once all squares have been processed, the output string will contain the desired string of length 3.
```

However, a developer may make a logic error in this code, such as forgetting to add a letter to the output string or adding the letters in the wrong order. This will cause the program to produce incorrect output.

Title:
ATCODER p03575 AtCoder Beginner Contest 075 - Bridge

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of edges.** The input format specifies that there are M edges, but the developer may accidentally count the number of vertices instead. This would result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Not correctly identifying bridges.** A bridge is an edge whose removal disconnects the graph. The developer may incorrectly identify an edge as a bridge even if it is not, or they may fail to identify a bridge that actually exists. This would result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to find bridges in a graph. The developer may use an algorithm that is inefficient or that does not work correctly. This would result in an incorrect answer or a long running time.
4. **Incorrectly handling errors.** The input format may contain errors, such as invalid values or missing data. The developer must be able to handle these errors gracefully without crashing the program. Otherwise, the program may not produce a correct answer or it may crash.
5. **Not testing the code.** It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. The developer should test the code with a variety of different inputs, including inputs that are likely to cause errors. This will help to identify any bugs in the code and ensure that it produces correct results.

Title:
ATCODER p03730 AtCoder Beginner Contest 060 - Choose Integers

Pain points:
### 1. Using the wrong data type

The input consists of three integers, `A`, `B`, and `C`. `A` and `B` are positive integers, and `C` is a non-negative integer. However, if you accidentally use the wrong data type for one of these values, you may get unexpected results. For example, if you use a `float` for `A`, `B`, or `C`, you may get an incorrect answer because floating-point numbers are not always precise.

### 2. Using the wrong operators

The problem asks you to find the remainder of `C` when divided by `B`. To do this, you need to use the modulo operator (`%`). If you accidentally use the division operator (`/`), you will get the wrong answer.

### 3. Not considering the case where `C` is negative

The problem states that `C` is a non-negative integer. However, if you accidentally forget to check this condition, you may get an incorrect answer. For example, if `C` is negative, the sum of the integers will never be congruent to `C` modulo `B`.

### 4. Not considering the case where `A` is equal to `B`

The problem states that `A` and `B` are positive integers. However, if `A` is equal to `B`, the sum of the integers will always be congruent to `C` modulo `B`. This is because any multiple of `A` is also a multiple of `B`.

### 5. Not considering the case where `B` is equal to 1

The problem states that `B` is a positive integer. However, if `B` is equal to 1, the sum of the integers will always be equal to `C`. This is because any multiple of `A` is also a multiple of `1`.

### 6. Not considering the case where `A` is equal to 1 and `B` is equal to 1

The problem states that `A` and `B` are positive integers. However, if `A` is equal to 1 and `B` is equal to 1, the sum of the integers will always be equal to `C`. This is because any multiple of `1` is also a multiple of `1`.

```

```
# 2. Using the wrong operators

```python
A, B, C = map(int, input().split())

Title:
ATCODER p03894 CODE FESTIVAL 2016 Relay (Parallel) - Magician

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type**

The input specifies that `N` and `Q` can be as large as `10^5`, so we need to use a data type that can store that large of a value. If we use an incorrect data type, such as `int`, we may get a `ValueError` when we try to store a value that is too large.

**2. Not handling invalid input**

The input specifies that `1 <= A_i < B_i <= N` for all `i`. If we do not check for invalid input, we may get a `ValueError` or a `RuntimeError`.

**3. Not handling the case where the ball is never swapped**

If the ball is never swapped, then it will always be in the leftmost cup. In this case, we need to make sure that we count the leftmost cup as a possible location for the ball.

**4. Not handling the case where the magic is cast**

If the magic is cast, then the ball may be teleported to a different cup. In this case, we need to make sure that we count the new location of the ball as a possible location.

**5. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved in `O(N + Q)` time using a simple algorithm. However, we can improve the running time to `O(Q)` by using a more efficient algorithm.

Title:
AIZU p00000 QQ

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of `for` loops.** The most common mistake is to use a `for` loop to iterate over the rows of the multiplication table, but not the columns. This will result in a table that is only half the size of the desired output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the product.** When multiplying two numbers, it is important to make sure that the operands are in the correct order. For example, `1 * 2` is not the same as `2 * 1`.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When printing the output of the multiplication table, it is important to make sure that the numbers are aligned correctly. A common mistake is to print the numbers one column to the right or left of where they should be.
4. **Incorrect use of the `end` keyword.** The `end` keyword is used to specify the character that should be printed after the last number in a row of the multiplication table. By default, the `end` keyword is set to `\n`, which means that a new line will be printed after each row. However, if you want to print the numbers without a newline, you can set the `end` keyword to `""`.
5. **Using the wrong data type.** When storing the numbers in the multiplication table, it is important to use the correct data type. For example, if you are using integers, you should not use floating-point numbers.
6. **Using an incorrect variable name.** When naming variables, it is important to use descriptive names that make it clear what the variable is used for. For example, a variable that stores the product of two numbers should be named `product`.
7. **Not using comments.** Comments are used to explain the code, making it easier for other developers to understand what the code is doing. It is important to use comments throughout your code, especially in complex or confusing areas.

1. Possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is very specific, and it is easy to make mistakes when writing the code to read the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the code will not be able to parse the input correctly.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is also very specific, and it is easy to make mistakes when writing the code to print the output. For example, if you forget to add a newline character after each output line, the output will be incorrect.
* **Incorrect calculation of the lap time:** The lap time is calculated by adding up the time taken for each acceleration parameter. It is easy to make mistakes when calculating the time for each acceleration parameter, or when adding up the times.
* **Incorrect checking of the start position:** The start position must be on the start/goal line, and it must not be touching any of the walls. It is easy to make mistakes when checking the start position, especially if the start/goal line is not a straight line.
* **Incorrect checking of the acceleration parameters:** The acceleration parameters must be either -1, 0, or 1. It is easy to make mistakes when checking the acceleration parameters, especially if the acceleration parameters are very close to -1, 0, or 1.
* **Incorrect checking of the goal:** The car must reach the goal line without crashing. It is easy to make mistakes when checking the goal, especially if the car is very close to the goal line.
* **Incorrect checking of the clockwise direction:** The car must run clockwise around the track. It is easy to make mistakes when checking the clockwise direction, especially if the track is not a simple circle.
* **Incorrect checking of the lap time:** The lap time must be correct to within 0.01 clock units. It is easy to make mistakes when checking the lap time, especially if the lap time is very close to a whole number.

2. To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test your code thoroughly with a variety of different input files. Finally, it is important to be careful when writing the code, and to double-check your work before submitting it.

Pain points:
0 0 0 0 0 0 

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is also very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if you forget to put a space between two numbers, the output will not be correct.
* **Incorrect calculation of the angle:** The angle between two vectors is calculated using the following formula:

```
angle = arccos(a · b / ||a|| ||b||)
```

where `a` and `b` are the two vectors and `||a||` and `||b||` are the lengths of the vectors. It is important to make sure that you are using the correct values for `a`, `b`, and `||a||`, otherwise the angle will be incorrect.
* **Incorrect comparison of angles:** When comparing two angles, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct order. The smaller angle should always come first. For example, if you compare the angles `0°` and `180°`, the smaller angle is `0°`.
* **Incorrect handling of duplicate vectors:** The input may contain duplicate vectors. It is important to make sure that you only output the pair of vectors with the smallest angle once. For example, if the input contains the vectors `(1, 2, 3)` and `(1, 2, 3)`, you should only output the pair `(1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3)` once.

AIZU p01052 Movie

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not correct. For example, if the input is "4\n1 31\n2 2\n2 3\n3 3", the program will throw an error because the input does not have 4 lines.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not correct. For example, if the output is "1700a", the program will throw an error because the output is not a number.

**3. Incorrect calculation**

The program may calculate the maximum value of the total happiness incorrectly. For example, if the input is "5\n1 10\n10 20\n20 21\n22 31\n4 20", the program may output "1750" instead of "1800" because it does not consider the fact that the movie with index 4 is shown on day 4 and day 20.

**4. Memory leak**

The program may not release memory properly, which may lead to a memory leak. For example, if the program uses a vector to store the movies, it may not delete the vector when it is no longer needed.

**5. Race condition**

The program may not be thread-safe, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if two threads are trying to update the same variable at the same time, the results may be incorrect.

Title:
AIZU p01802 Koto Municipal Subway

Pain points:
1. The input format is not clear. It is not clear whether the input is a single line or multiple lines.
2. The output format is not clear. It is not clear whether the output should be a single number or multiple numbers.
3. The problem statement is not clear. It is not clear what the goal of the problem is.
4. The code is not clear. It is not clear what the code is doing.
5. The tests are not clear. It is not clear what the tests are testing.

Here are some possible solutions to these problems:

1. The input format can be clarified by using a multiline string to represent the input. For example, the input could be represented as follows:

```
D E
7 5
7 6
7 7
76 5
8 41
0 0
```

2. The output format can be clarified by using a single number to represent the output. For example, the output could be represented as follows:

```
0.4142135624
0
0.0827625303
0
48.7401153702
33
```

3. The problem statement can be clarified by providing more details about the goal of the problem. For example, the problem statement could be modified to read as follows:

> Given a distance D and a budget E, find the minimum possible difference between the cost of building a subway line from Koto station to Shin-Koto station and the budget.

4. The code can be clarified by adding comments to explain what each line of code is doing. For example, the code could be modified to read as follows:

```
# This function takes the distance D and the budget E as input and returns the minimum possible difference between the cost of building a subway line from Koto station to Shin-Koto station and the budget.
def find_minimum_difference(D, E):

  # Initialize the minimum difference to a large number.
  minimum_difference = 10**10

  # Iterate over all possible values of x and y that satisfy the equation x + y = D.
  for x in range(1, D + 1):
    for y in range(1, D + 1):
      # Calculate the cost of building the subway line.
      cost = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)

      # If the cost is less than or equal to the budget and the difference between the cost and the budget is less than the current minimum difference, update the minimum difference.
      if cost <= E and abs(cost - E) < minimum_difference:
        minimum_difference = abs(cost - E)

  # Return the minimum difference.
  return minimum_difference

# Read the input.
D, E = map(int, input().split())

# Find the minimum possible difference between the cost of building a subway line from Koto station to Shin-Koto station and the budget.
minimum_difference = find_minimum_difference(D, E)

# Print the minimum difference.
print(minimum_difference)
```

5. The tests can be clarified by providing more details about what each test is testing. For example, the tests could be modified to read as follows:

```
# Test 1:
# Input:
D = 2
E = 1
# Expected output:
0.4142135624

# Test 2:
# Input:
D = 7
E = 5
# Expected output:
0

# Test 3:
# Input:
D = 7
E = 6
# Expected output:
0.0827625303

# Test 4:
# Input:
D = 76
E = 5
# Expected output:
48.7401153702

# Test 5:
# Input:
D = 8
E = 41
# Expected output:
33

Title:
AIZU p01936 Steps

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input is a list of two integers, `N` and `M`. `N` represents the number of floors in the building, and `M` represents the number of moves that AOR Ika-chan can make. If we use the wrong data type to store these values, we may get incorrect results. For example, if we use `int` to store `N`, we may get an overflow error when `N` is a large number.

**2. Not handling the boundary cases correctly**

The problem states that `N` is a non-negative integer and `M` is a positive integer. We need to make sure that we handle these boundary cases correctly. For example, if `N` is zero, then AOR Ika-chan cannot visit any floors, so the answer is zero.

**3. Making a mistake in the algorithm**

The algorithm for finding the number of ways to visit all floors more than once is not trivial. We need to make sure that we implement the algorithm correctly. For example, we need to make sure that we take into account the fact that AOR Ika-chan cannot visit the 0th floor or the `N+1`st floor.

**4. Using the wrong modulo operator**

The problem states that we need to find the remainder of the number by `1000000007 (= 10^9 + 7)`. We need to make sure that we use the correct modulo operator to get the correct answer. For example, if we use `%` instead of `%`, we may get incorrect results.
