CODECHEF cmb03

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of comparison operators**. When comparing two binary strings, you must use the `==` operator, not the `==` operator. The `==` operator compares the references of two objects, not their values.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. When working with substrings, it is important to make sure that you are not accidentally including or excluding characters from the substring.
3. **Incorrect handling of empty strings**. Be careful when handling empty strings, as they can have unexpected results.
4. **Incorrect use of loops**. When iterating over a string, it is important to make sure that you stop iterating at the correct time.
5. **Incorrect use of functions**. Make sure that you are using functions correctly and that you are passing them the correct arguments.
6. **Incorrect error handling**. Make sure that you are handling errors correctly and that you are not silently ignoring them.
7. **Incorrect use of data structures**. Make sure that you are using data structures correctly and that you are not accidentally creating memory leaks.
8. **Incorrect indentation**. Make sure that your code is properly indented so that it is easy to read and understand.
9. **Incorrect comments**. Make sure that your comments are clear and concise and that they accurately describe the code that they are commenting on.
10. **Incorrect naming conventions**. Make sure that you are using descriptive variable names and that your code is easy to read and understand.

CODECHEF flow014

Pain points:
1. The input format is not specified clearly. Does it have to be a single line of space-separated integers? Or can it be multiple lines?
2. The output format is not specified clearly. Does it have to be a single line of integers? Or can it be multiple lines?
3. The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input data is invalid. For example, if the hardness is less than 50, or the carbon content is greater than 0.7, or the tensile strength is less than 5600.
4. The problem statement does not specify what to do if there are multiple solutions. For example, if the hardness, carbon content, and tensile strength are all equal to 50, then the grade could be 10, 9, 8, 7, or 6.
5. The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input data is inconsistent. For example, if the hardness is greater than 50, but the carbon content is greater than 0.7.

CODECHEF levy

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the Sieve of Eratosthenes**. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a very efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given integer. However, it is important to use the algorithm correctly, or you may miss some primes. For example, if you only iterate over the odd numbers, you will miss all even primes.
2. **Incorrect use of the Chinese remainder theorem**. The Chinese remainder theorem is a powerful tool for solving systems of congruences. However, it is important to use the theorem correctly, or you may get incorrect results. For example, if you do not reduce the moduli modulo their greatest common divisor, you may get incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect use of the extended Euclidean algorithm**. The extended Euclidean algorithm is a powerful tool for finding the greatest common divisor of two integers. However, it is important to use the algorithm correctly, or you may get incorrect results. For example, if you do not use the correct sign convention, you may get the wrong answer.
4. **Incorrect use of the binary search algorithm**. The binary search algorithm is a very efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array. However, it is important to use the algorithm correctly, or you may get incorrect results. For example, if you do not initialize the left and right pointers correctly, you may miss the element you are looking for.
5. **Incorrect use of the brute-force algorithm**. The brute-force algorithm is a very simple algorithm that can be used to solve a variety of problems. However, it is often not very efficient. For example, if you use the brute-force algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a given integer, it will take a very long time.

# 1. Using the wrong data type for the input number

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print('no')
    else:
        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                print('no')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
```

This code will work fine for small numbers, but it will fail for large numbers because the `int` data type has a maximum value of `2**31-1`. For numbers larger than this, the `int` data type will overflow and the code will produce incorrect results.

To fix this problem, we can use the `long` data type, which has a much larger maximum value.

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print('no')
    else:
        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                print('no')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
```

# 2. Not checking for non-integer inputs

The code above will also fail if the input number is not an integer. To fix this, we can add a check to make sure that the input number is a valid integer.

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = input()
    if n.isdigit():
        n = int(n)
        if n == 1:
            print('no')
        else:
            for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
                if n % i == 0:
                    print('no')
                    break
            else:
                print('yes')
    else:
        print('invalid')
```

# 3. Using an inefficient algorithm

The code above uses a brute-force algorithm to check if a number is prime. This algorithm is very inefficient for large numbers, as it requires checking every number from 2 to the square root of the input number.

To improve the efficiency of the algorithm, we can use a more efficient algorithm, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n == 1:
        return False
    elif n == 2:
        return True
    else:
        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    if is_prime(n):
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')
```

# 4. Using incorrect logic

The code above also uses incorrect logic to check if a number is prime. The code checks if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the input number. However, this is not sufficient to determine if a number is prime, as there are some composite numbers that are divisible by numbers greater than the square root of the input number.

To fix this problem, we can add a check to make sure that the number is not divisible by any number greater than the square root of the input number.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n == 1:
        return False
    elif n == 2:
        return True
    else:
        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        for i in range(int(n**0.5) + 1, n):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    if is_prime(n):
        print('yes')
    else:

Title:
CODECHEF taand

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input array can contain very large integers, so it's important to use the correct data type to store the elements. In C++, you should use `long long` instead of `int`.

**2. Not using the right algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start with the two smallest elements in the array and keep merging them until we reach the largest possible value.

**3. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

The problem statement specifies that `1 <= u < v <= N`. It's important to make sure that your algorithm satisfies this constraint.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement specifies that `0 <= Ai <= 10^9`. It's important to make sure that your algorithm handles these edge cases correctly.

**5. Insufficient testing**

It's important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly for all possible inputs.

Pain points:
**1. The program may not terminate after receiving the answer 0.** This can happen if the program does not properly handle the end-of-file condition.
2. The program may not receive an answer 0 from the rocket, even if the distance to Mars is uniquely determined by the already received rocket's answers. This can happen if the program does not ask enough questions or if the questions are not asked in the correct order.
3. The program may receive an incorrect answer from the rocket. This can happen if the rocket's sequence p is not properly initialized or if the rocket's logic is incorrect.
4. The program may exceed the time limit. This can happen if the program is too slow or if it uses too much memory.
5. The program may produce incorrect output. This can happen if the program's logic is incorrect or if the program does not handle errors properly.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and to understand the requirements. It is also important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and that it terminates correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1056_G. Take Metro

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem states that the first line should contain two integers n and m, and the second line should contain two integers s and t. However, if the input format is not correct, the program may crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the input is "10 4\n3 5 a", the program will crash because it cannot parse the character "a" as an integer.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the exit station**

The problem states that Arkady will exit the metro at the station where t = 0. However, if the calculation of t is incorrect, the program may output an incorrect exit station. For example, if t is initially 10, and Arkady takes a clockwise-directed train for 5 stations, then t should be 5. However, if the program incorrectly calculates t as 6, then it will output the incorrect exit station of 6.

**3. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

The problem states that the number of stations must be at least 3 and the number of red stations must be at least 1. However, if the input violates these constraints, the program may crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the input is "2 0\n1 1", the program will crash because it cannot divide by 0.

**4. Incorrect use of pointers**

The problem states that the input should be read from standard input and the output should be written to standard output. However, if the program uses pointers incorrectly, it may read or write to the wrong location in memory, which can lead to incorrect output or a crash. For example, if the program uses a pointer to a local variable that is later deleted, it may read or write to invalid memory, which can lead to a crash.

**5. Incorrect use of dynamic memory**

The problem does not specify whether the program is allowed to use dynamic memory. However, if the program uses dynamic memory incorrectly, it may cause a memory leak or a segmentation fault. For example, if the program allocates memory for a data structure but does not free it when it is no longer needed, it may cause a memory leak.
Test inputs:
```
# 1. Incorrect input format

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may contain a number that is too large or too small, or it may contain a non-integer value.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not always find the correct answer, or it may take too long to run.
4. **Incorrect data structures**. The data structures used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the data structures may not be able to store all of the data, or they may not be able to efficiently access the data.
5. **Incorrect error handling**. The code may not handle errors correctly. For example, the code may crash if the input is incorrect, or it may not print an error message if the output is incorrect.
6. **Incorrect testing**. The code may not be tested thoroughly. For example, the code may not be tested with all possible input values, or it may not be tested with invalid input values.
7. **Incorrect documentation**. The code may not be well-documented. For example, the code may not have comments explaining what it does, or it may not have a readme file explaining how to use the code.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer may incorrectly parse the input data, resulting in an incorrect answer.
* The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem, resulting in an incorrect answer or a long running time.
* The developer may use incorrect data structures to store the data, resulting in a long running time or an incorrect answer.
* The developer may incorrectly handle errors, resulting in a crash or an incorrect answer.
* The developer may not test the code thoroughly, resulting in an incorrect answer or a bug that is not caught until it is too late.
* The developer may not document the code well, making it difficult for other developers to understand and use the code.
Test inputs:
```

```

This input is incorrect because the number of professors is 1, but the number of pairs of seats is 0. This is not possible because there must be at least one pair of seats in order to have a seniority relation.

```
3 2001 3

3 1
```

This input is incorrect because the given seniority relations are contradictory. In particular, the first relation states that professor 1 is more senior than professor 2, but the second relation states that professor 2 is more senior than professor 1. This is a contradiction, and so the program should not be able to find a valid arrangement of professors.

```

Title:
CODEFORCES 109_B. Lucky Probability

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not specified in the problem statement. If the input format is not specified, the developer may make a mistake in parsing the input. For example, the developer may assume that the input is a list of integers, when in fact it is a string. This would lead to a incorrect answer.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the probability**

The probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. The developer may make a mistake in calculating either the number of favorable outcomes or the total number of outcomes. For example, the developer may forget to account for the fact that the interval [min(v, p), max(v, p)] may not contain any lucky numbers. This would lead to an incorrect answer.

**3. Numerical errors**

The developer may make a mistake in computing the probability due to numerical errors. For example, the developer may round the numbers to the wrong number of digits. This would lead to an incorrect answer.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

The developer may make a mistake in counting the number of lucky numbers in the interval [min(v, p), max(v, p)]. For example, the developer may forget to include the endpoints of the interval. This would lead to an incorrect answer.

**5. Incorrect use of mathematical functions**

The developer may make a mistake in using mathematical functions, such as the factorial function. For example, the developer may use the factorial function to calculate the number of ways to choose k lucky numbers from the interval [min(v, p), max(v, p)]. This would lead to an incorrect answer.

CODEFORCES 1120_B. Once in a casino

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not strictly defined. For example, the input `223 322` is incorrect because it does not contain a newline character between the two numbers. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem is also not strictly defined. For example, the output `2 1 1 2 -1` is incorrect because it does not have a newline character between the two lines of output. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. The problem requires the player to win the jackpot, which means that the final number must be equal to `b`. However, it is possible for the player to make a mistake and end up with a number that is one digit off from `b`. This can lead to the player losing the jackpot and the program crashing.
4. **Infinite loops**. The problem requires the player to win the jackpot in a finite number of moves. However, it is possible for the player to make a mistake and end up in an infinite loop where they keep making the same moves over and over again. This can lead to the program crashing or running out of memory.
5. **Incorrect algorithm**. The player must use an algorithm that will always lead them to win the jackpot in a finite number of moves. However, it is possible for the player to use an incorrect algorithm that will never lead them to win the jackpot. This can lead to the player losing the jackpot and the program crashing.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test your program thoroughly to make sure that it is correct.

3. **Incorrect implementation of the modulo operation.** The modulo operation should be done on the final answer, not on intermediate values.
4. **Incorrect use of the 998244353 prime.** The 998244353 prime should only be used for modulo operations, not for other calculations.
5. **Incorrect input handling.** The input should be read in as a string, not as a list of characters.
6. **Incorrect output handling.** The output should be printed as a single integer, not as a list of integers.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use a test harness to verify that your code is correct.
* Use the debugger to step through your code and identify errors.
* Read the problem statement carefully and make sure you understand all of the requirements.
* Use the resources available to you, such as online forums and documentation, to help you solve the problem.

Pain points:



 There are still two upvotes in total.
 **1. Incorrect variable type**

When reading the input, make sure that you are reading the input into the correct type of variable. For example, if you are reading an integer, make sure that you are reading it into an `int` variable. If you read the input into a `string` variable, you will get a `ValueError`.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

When iterating over a list or a range, make sure that you are not off by one. For example, if you are iterating over a list of 5 elements, make sure that you iterate from 0 to 4. If you iterate from 0 to 5, you will get an `IndexError`.

**3. Logic errors**

When writing your code, make sure that your logic is correct. For example, if you are trying to find the maximum value in a list, make sure that you are comparing the values correctly.

**4. Undefined variables**

When using variables in your code, make sure that they are defined. For example, if you try to use a variable that has not been initialized, you will get a `NameError`.

**5. Uncaught exceptions**

When your code encounters an error, it should raise an exception. If your code does not catch the exception, the program will crash.

**6. Memory leaks**

When your code is finished running, it should free up any memory that it is using. If your code does not free up the memory, it will eventually run out of memory and crash.

    * **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correct. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or the number of participants may be negative.
    * **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correct. For example, the output may not contain the correct number of lines, or the output may contain numbers that are not formatted correctly.
    * **Incorrect logic:** The logic of the program may be incorrect. For example, the program may not calculate the maximum height of the mushroom correctly, or the program may not sort the participants correctly.
    * **Memory leaks:** The program may leak memory. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
    * **Synchronization issues:** The program may have synchronization issues. This can cause the program to behave incorrectly or to crash.
    * **Race conditions:** The program may have race conditions. This can cause the program to behave incorrectly or to crash.
    * **Deadlocks:** The program may deadlock. This can cause the program to stop responding and to appear to be frozen.
    * **Security vulnerabilities:** The program may have security vulnerabilities. This can allow attackers to gain access to the program's data or to control the program's behavior.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design and implement the program. It is also important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and that it does not have any bugs.

### Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to read the document identifier, or if you read the document identifier incorrectly, your program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format for this problem is also very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if you forget to print the subject number, or if you print the subject number incorrectly, your program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic for solving this problem is not very complicated, but it is still possible to make a mistake. For example, if you forget to check that the document identifier is valid, or if you forget to check that the document text is correct, your program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.
4. **Runtime errors**. This problem is not very computationally intensive, but it is still possible to make a runtime error. For example, if you allocate too much memory, or if you use an incorrect data structure, your program may crash or run out of memory.
5. **Memory leaks**. This problem does not require you to allocate a lot of memory, but it is still possible to create a memory leak. For example, if you forget to free a memory block, or if you use a data structure that leaks memory, your program may eventually run out of memory.

By following the tips below, you can help to avoid these problems and bugs:

* **Be careful when reading the input format**. Make sure that you understand the input format and that you are reading the input correctly.
* **Be careful when writing the output format**. Make sure that you understand the output format and that you are writing the output correctly.
* **Test your code thoroughly**. Make sure that you test your code on a variety of input data sets to ensure that it is working correctly.
* **Use a debugger**. If you are having trouble debugging your code, use a debugger to help you identify the problem.
* **Ask for help**. If you are still having trouble solving the problem, ask for help from a mentor or teacher.

CODEFORCES 232_C. Doe Graphs

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input graph can be very large, so we need to use a data type that can store large integers. The %lld specifier is used to read and write 64-bit integers in C++, but it is not preferred. We should use cin and cout streams or the %I64d specifier instead.

**2. Not handling the case where `ai == bi`**

The problem statement says that `ai ≠ bi`, but we should still handle the case where `ai == bi`. In this case, the shortest path between `ai` and `bi` is 0.

**3. Using a brute-force approach**

The brute-force approach to finding the shortest path between two vertices in a graph is to enumerate all possible paths and find the shortest one. This approach is not efficient for large graphs.

**4. Not using a data structure to store the graph**

We can use a data structure to store the graph, such as an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix. This will make it easier to find the shortest path between two vertices.

**5. Not using a priority queue to find the shortest path**

We can use a priority queue to find the shortest path between two vertices. This will make the algorithm more efficient.

**6. Making a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm**

The algorithm for finding the shortest path between two vertices in a graph is a well-known algorithm. However, it is easy to make a mistake in the implementation. We should carefully check our code to make sure that it is correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 258_B. Little Elephant and Elections

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is `7 4`, the program will expect two integers, but only one is given.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the output is `1440a`, the program will expect a single integer, but a string is given.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The program may contain errors in the calculation, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program uses `m % 1000000007` instead of `(m % 1000000007) + (m % 1000000007)`, the results will be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect modulo operation**. The program may use incorrect modulo operation, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program uses `m % 1000000007` instead of `(m % 1000000007) + (m % 1000000007)`, the results will be incorrect.
5. **Incorrect use of variables**. The program may use variables incorrectly, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program uses `n` to represent the number of lucky digits in the Little Elephant Political Party ballot number, and `m` to represent the total number of lucky digits in the ballot numbers of 6 other parties, the results will be incorrect.

Title:
CODEFORCES 281_B. Nearest Fraction

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect calculation of the greatest common divisor.** The greatest common divisor of two integers `a` and `b` can be calculated using the Euclidean algorithm. The following is an example of how to implement the Euclidean algorithm in Python:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```

2. **Incorrect rounding of the fractional part of the result.** When rounding the fractional part of the result, it is important to round to the nearest integer, not to the nearest multiple of `1 / n`. The following is an example of how to round a floating-point number to the nearest integer in Python:

```python
def round_to_nearest_integer(x):
    return int(x + 0.5)
```

3. **Incorrect handling of degenerate cases.** The problem statement specifies that the denominator of the output fraction must be no more than `n`. However, it is possible that the numerator of the output fraction is greater than `n`. In this case, the output fraction should be `n / 1`. The following is an example of how to handle this case in Python:

```python
def solve(x, y, n):
    if x == 0:
        return '0/1'
    gcd = gcd(x, y)
    x //= gcd
    y //= gcd
    if y > n:
        return f'{n}/{1}'
    return f'{x}/{y}'

Title:
CODEFORCES 304_A. Pythagorean Theorem II

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Pythagorean theorem.** The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This means that if you know the lengths of any two sides of a right triangle, you can find the length of the third side by squaring each side and adding them together, then taking the square root of the result. However, some developers may incorrectly implement the Pythagorean theorem by squaring each side and then adding them together, which will not give the correct answer.
2. **Incorrect use of the square root function.** The square root function returns the positive square root of a number. This means that if you pass a negative number to the square root function, it will return NaN (not a number). Some developers may incorrectly use the square root function on a negative number, which will cause their program to crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When counting the number of right-angled triangles with side-lengths a, b, and c, it is important to make sure that you include all of the possible combinations. For example, if you are counting the number of right-angled triangles with side-lengths 1, 2, and 3, you need to include the triangle with sides 1, 2, and 3, as well as the triangle with sides 2, 1, and 3. Some developers may make an off-by-one error and forget to include one of the possible combinations, which will result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. This means that if you divide a number by another number, the modulo operator will return the remainder of the division. Some developers may incorrectly use the modulo operator when counting the number of right-angled triangles, which will result in an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect use of the range function.** The range function returns a sequence of numbers from a starting point to an ending point. The ending point is not included in the sequence. Some developers may incorrectly use the range function when counting the number of right-angled triangles, which will result in an incorrect answer.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correct. For example, the output may not have the correct number of lines, or the output may contain incorrect data.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program is incorrect. For example, the program may not construct the minimum number of roads, or the program may construct roads that violate the constraints of the problem.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program may not release memory that it has allocated. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
5. **Synchronization issues**. The program may not be thread-safe. This can lead to race conditions, which can corrupt data or cause the program to crash.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may contain security vulnerabilities. For example, the program may allow a malicious user to execute arbitrary code or to access sensitive data.

CODEFORCES 420_D. Cup Trick

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of operations.** The input format specifies that the first line contains two integers `n` and `m`, where `n` is the number of cups and `m` is the number of operations. A common mistake is to forget to subtract 1 from `m` when counting the number of operations, which will result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrectly implementing the operations.** The operations are described as a series of pairs of integers `(xi, yi)`, where `xi` is the mark on the cup that is being moved and `yi` is the position of the cup that it is being moved to. A common mistake is to forget to check that `xi` and `yi` are valid values, which could lead to an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrectly computing the final permutation.** Once all of the operations have been performed, the final permutation of the cups can be computed by simply iterating through the cups in order and assigning them the next available mark. A common mistake is to forget to check that there are enough marks available, which could lead to an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrectly printing the output.** The output format specifies that the final permutation of the cups should be printed as a list of `n` distinct integers, each from 1 to `n`. A common mistake is to print the permutation in the wrong order, or to print duplicate values, which will result in an incorrect answer.

Title:
CODEFORCES 590_C. Three States

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It expects two integers on the first line, representing the number of rows and columns in the map. Each of the following lines should contain m characters, representing the cells in a row of the map. Each character should be either a digit from 1 to 3, representing the state that the cell belongs to, a period (.), representing a cell where it is allowed to build a road, or a hash (#), representing a cell where it is not allowed to build a road. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer, representing the minimum number of cells that need to be built in order to connect all the cells of all states. If it is not possible to connect all the cells of all states, the output should be -1. If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly output the answer and will likely crash.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic for this problem is relatively simple. The first step is to create a graph, where each vertex represents a cell in the map and each edge represents a possible connection between two cells. The next step is to find a minimum spanning tree for this graph. A minimum spanning tree is a subset of the edges in the graph such that every vertex is connected to every other vertex and the total weight of the edges in the tree is minimized. The minimum number of cells that need to be built in order to connect all the cells of all states is equal to the total weight of the edges in the minimum spanning tree.

There are a few ways to find a minimum spanning tree. One common way is to use Kruskal's algorithm. Kruskal's algorithm works by repeatedly adding the lightest edge to the minimum spanning tree until all the vertices are connected. Another common way to find a minimum spanning tree is to use Prim's algorithm. Prim's algorithm works by starting with a single vertex and repeatedly adding the lightest edge that connects to a vertex that is already in the minimum spanning tree.

**4. Runtime errors**

The runtime of this problem can be quite large, especially for large maps. One way to improve the runtime is to use a more efficient data structure to represent the graph. Another way to improve the runtime is to use a more efficient algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree.

**5. Memory errors**

The memory usage of this problem can also be quite large, especially for large maps. One way to reduce the memory usage is to use a more compact data structure to represent the graph. Another way to reduce the memory usage is to use a more efficient algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree.

Title:
CODEFORCES 612_B. HDD is Outdated Technology

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem is about finding the time needed to read a file split into n fragments. The magnetic head should move from one sector to another to read the file. The time it takes to move the magnetic head from one sector to another is |a - b| time units, where a and b are the indices of the sectors. The fragments are read in the order from the first to the n-th.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution should first find the maximum value in the array of fragment numbers. This value represents the index of the last sector that the magnetic head needs to move to. Then, the solution should iterate through the array of fragment numbers, starting from the first fragment number. For each fragment number, the solution should calculate the distance between the current fragment number and the maximum fragment number. The sum of these distances is the total time needed to read the file.
3. **Incorrect testing of the solution.** The solution should be tested on a variety of input data sets. The input data sets should include cases where the number of fragments is small, the number of fragments is large, and the fragment numbers are in different orders. The solution should also be tested on cases where there are duplicate fragment numbers in the input data set.
4. **Incorrect documentation of the solution.** The solution should be well-documented so that other developers can understand how it works. The documentation should include a description of the problem, the solution, and the test cases.
5. **Incorrect submission of the solution.** The solution should be submitted in the correct format. The solution should be a text file that contains the source code of the solution. The file name should be the same as the problem name. The solution should be submitted to the correct contest.

Title:
CODEFORCES 632_B. Alice, Bob, Two Teams

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem statement is not very clear, so it is important to read it carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked. In this problem, for example, it is important to understand that Bob can only flip a prefix or suffix of the string, and that he can only do this once.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution to this problem is relatively straightforward, but there are a few places where it is easy to make mistakes. For example, it is important to make sure that you are correctly calculating the sum of the strengths of the pieces in each team, and that you are correctly updating the values of the variables `alice_strength` and `bob_strength`.
3. **Incorrect testing of the solution.** It is always important to test your solution to make sure that it is correct. In this problem, for example, you can test your solution by generating some test cases and checking that the output is correct.
4. **Failure to account for all possible cases.** The problem statement does not explicitly state that all of the pieces have different strengths, but it is implied by the fact that the sum of the strengths of the pieces is less than `10^9`. If you do not account for this case, your solution will not be correct.
5. **Using incorrect data types.** The problem statement states that the number of pieces is less than `5*10^5`, so it is safe to use an `int` data type to store this value. However, the strengths of the pieces can be as large as `10^9`, so you need to use a larger data type, such as a `long long`, to store these values.
6. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common source of bugs in programming. In this problem, for example, it is important to make sure that you are correctly calculating the indices of the first and last elements of the prefix or suffix that Bob flips.
7. **Using incorrect variable names.** Using incorrect variable names can make your code difficult to read and understand. In this problem, for example, it is important to use names that clearly indicate the purpose of the variable.
8. **Using global variables.** Global variables can make your code difficult to debug and maintain. In this problem, it is better to use local variables instead of global variables.
9. **Not using comments.** Comments can help other developers understand your code. In this problem, for example, it is helpful to include comments that explain the purpose of each function and the steps of the algorithm.
10. **Not using unit tests.** Unit tests can help you catch bugs early in the development process. In this problem, for example, you can write unit tests to check that your solution correctly calculates the sum of the strengths of the pieces in each team.

CODEFORCES 660_E. Different Subsets For All Tuples

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**

When working with large numbers, it is important to use the correct modulo operator. In this problem, the modulo operator should be `% 109 + 7`, not simply `% 109`.

**2. Not initializing variables correctly**

When declaring variables, it is important to initialize them to the correct value. In this problem, the variable `c` should be initialized to 0, not to a random value.

**3. Using the wrong formula**

The formula for the number of distinct subsequences of a sequence of length n is `(n + m - 1)! / (n! * (m - 1)!)`. In this problem, the variable `m` represents the upper bound for the elements in the sequence, not the number of elements in the sequence.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

When counting the number of subsequences, it is important to be careful about off-by-one errors. For example, if you are counting the number of subsequences of a sequence of length n, you need to make sure to include the empty subsequence.

**5. Using incorrect data types**

When working with large numbers, it is important to use the correct data types. In this problem, the variables `n` and `m` should be declared as `int`s, not as `long`s.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or it may not contain two integers separated by a space.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may not contain two lines, or the second line may not contain a sequence of characters that determines movements and pushes of the loader.
3. **Incorrect solution**. The solution may not be correct. For example, the solution may not move the load to the desired cell, or it may require more pushes or movements than necessary.
4. **Runtime error**. The solution may not run correctly due to a runtime error. For example, the solution may attempt to access a memory location that does not exist, or it may divide by zero.
5. **Memory error**. The solution may not run correctly due to a memory error. For example, the solution may allocate too much memory, or it may not free memory that it is no longer using.
6. **Timeout**. The solution may not run correctly due to a timeout. For example, the solution may take too long to run, or it may not terminate at all.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test your solution thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and runs correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 707_C. Pythagorean Triples

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong formula**

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This means that for a right triangle with sides a, b, and c, where c is the hypotenuse, we have

```
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
```

However, some developers may mistakenly use the following formula to find the third side of a right triangle:

```
c = a + b
```

This formula is incorrect, as it does not take into account the fact that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

**2. Using the wrong type of data**

The input and output of this problem are both integers. However, some developers may mistakenly use floating-point numbers, which can lead to incorrect results.

**3. Not handling special cases**

The input to this problem can be 1, which is not a valid side length for a right triangle. Some developers may not handle this case correctly, which can lead to errors.

**4. Using an inefficient algorithm**

The naive algorithm for finding Pythagorean triples involves checking all possible combinations of a, b, and c until a valid triple is found. This algorithm can be very inefficient, especially for large values of n.

**5. Not using memoization**

Memoization is a technique that can be used to speed up the computation of Pythagorean triples. Memoization involves storing the results of previously computed values, so that they do not need to be recomputed each time. This can significantly reduce the running time of the algorithm.

**6. Not using the Sieve of Eratosthenes**

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a very efficient algorithm for finding prime numbers. It can be used to quickly identify which numbers are not prime, which can then be used to rule out invalid Pythagorean triples.

**7. Not using the Chinese remainder theorem**

The Chinese remainder theorem is a powerful tool that can be used to solve systems of congruences. It can be used to find Pythagorean triples that satisfy certain constraints, such as having a specific hypotenuse length.

Title:
CODEFORCES 72_D. Perse-script

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect function calls:**

The functions in Perse-script are case-insensitive. So to call substr function you can write SUBsTr(). But you can't print as the result "hElLo" instead of printing "Hello".

**2. Incorrect arguments:**

The arguments of the functions must be valid. For example, the arguments of substr function must be integers and they must be in the range [1, n] where n is the length of the string.

**3. Unbalanced parentheses:**

The parentheses in the expression must be balanced. For example, the following expression is incorrect:

```
concat("Hello", "World")
```

The correct way to write this expression is:

```
concat("Hello", "World")
```

**4. Undefined functions:**

The functions that you use in the expression must be defined. For example, the following expression is incorrect:

```
foo("Hello")
```

The function foo is not defined in Perse-script.

**5. Incorrect string literals:**

The string literals in Perse-script must be enclosed in double quotes. For example, the following expression is incorrect:

```
concat(Hello, World)
```

The correct way to write this expression is:

```
concat("Hello", "World")
```
Test inputs:
1. Incorrect function calls:

```

CODEFORCES 750_A. New Year and Hurry

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect calculation of the time required to solve all the problems.** The developer may forget to take into account the time required to get to the party, or may incorrectly calculate the total time required to solve all the problems.
* **Incorrect comparison of the time required to solve all the problems and the time required to get to the party.** The developer may compare the two times incorrectly, or may forget to take into account the fact that the party starts at midnight.
* **Incorrect output of the maximum number of problems that Limak can solve.** The developer may output the wrong number of problems, or may not output anything at all.

Here are some tips to avoid these problems:

* **Be careful when calculating the time required to solve all the problems.** Make sure to take into account the time required to get to the party.
* **Double-check your calculations before comparing the time required to solve all the problems and the time required to get to the party.** Make sure that you are comparing the two times correctly.
* **Be sure to output the maximum number of problems that Limak can solve.** Don't forget to add 1 to the number of problems that Limak can solve, to account for the fact that the party starts at midnight.

Title:
CODEFORCES 773_E. Blog Post Rating

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data contains integers in a large range. If you use an incorrect data type to store these integers, you may get an overflow error. For example, if you use `int` to store `5·105`, you may get an overflow error when computing the maximum possible community rating.

**2. Using incorrect algorithms**

The problem asks for the maximum possible community rating of the blog post after users with indices from 1 to k visit the blog post page, rate the blog post, and close the page. A naive solution is to iterate over all possible orders of the users and compute the maximum possible community rating for each order. This solution has a time complexity of `O(n!)`, which is too slow for large values of `n`.

A more efficient solution is to use a dynamic programming approach. We can define the following state: `dp[i][j]` is the maximum possible community rating of the blog post after users with indices from 1 to i have visited the blog post page, and the current community rating is j. We can then compute the following recurrence relation:

```
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - ai] + 1)
```

where `ai` is the estimated blog post rating of the `i`th user.

This recurrence relation can be used to compute the maximum possible community rating in time `O(n)`.

**3. Incorrect implementation**

Even if you use the correct data types and algorithms, you may still get incorrect results if your implementation is incorrect. For example, you may forget to initialize the `dp` array, or you may make a mistake in the implementation of the recurrence relation.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

When computing the maximum possible community rating, it is important to make sure that you account for all possible cases. For example, you may forget to consider the case where the current community rating is equal to the estimated blog post rating of the current user.

**5. Undefined behavior**

The problem does not specify the behavior of the blog post rating function in the case where the estimated blog post rating is negative. If you do not handle this case correctly, you may get undefined behavior.

  2. The second graph has 3 bridges and 1 non-bridge edge. 
  3. The third graph has 6 bridges and 0 non-bridge edge.  **1. The input format is not correct.**

The input format is `q n1 n2 ... nq`, where `q` is the number of graphs and `n1`, `n2`, ..., `nq` are the number of vertices in each graph. However, the input format in the problem statement is `q ni ... nq`, where `q` is the number of graphs and `ni` is the number of vertices in the first graph. This is incorrect because the input format does not specify the number of graphs.

**2. The output format is not correct.**

The output format is `m1 m2 ... mq`, where `m1`, `m2`, ..., `mq` are the maximum number of edges in each graph. However, the output format in the problem statement is `m`, where `m` is the maximum number of edges in the first graph. This is incorrect because the output format does not specify the number of graphs.

**3. The problem statement is not clear.**

The problem statement does not specify what a bridge is. A bridge is an edge that belongs to every path between two vertices. However, the problem statement does not specify what a path is. A path is a sequence of vertices that are connected by edges.

**4. The problem is not well-defined.**

The problem is not well-defined because it does not specify how to construct a graph with at least half of the edges being bridges. It is possible to construct a graph with at least half of the edges being bridges in many different ways.

**5. The problem is too difficult.**

The problem is too difficult because it requires the developer to have a strong understanding of graph theory. Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that studies graphs, which are mathematical objects that consist of vertices and edges.

**6. The problem is not interesting.**

The problem is not interesting because it does not have any real-world applications. There are no known applications of graph theory to the development of computer games.

CODEFORCES 864_E. Fire

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm.** The greedy algorithm is a simple but powerful technique that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. However, it is important to implement the algorithm correctly in order to get the correct results. One common mistake is to forget to sort the items by their profit per second. This can lead to the algorithm choosing items that are not the most profitable to save.
* **Incorrect use of the priority queue.** The priority queue is a data structure that can be used to efficiently find the item with the highest priority. However, it is important to use the priority queue correctly in order to get the correct results. One common mistake is to add items to the priority queue in the wrong order. This can lead to the algorithm choosing items that are not the most profitable to save.
* **Incorrect handling of ties.** When there are multiple items with the same profit per second, the greedy algorithm must choose one of them to save. There are a few different ways to handle ties, and the choice of which method to use can affect the results of the algorithm. One common mistake is to always choose the item that appears first in the input. This can lead to the algorithm choosing items that are not the most profitable to save.

**Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:**

* **Test your code thoroughly.** One of the best ways to find bugs in your code is to test it thoroughly. This means testing your code on a variety of inputs, including inputs that are designed to test for specific problems.
* **Use a debugger.** A debugger can be a helpful tool for finding bugs in your code. A debugger allows you to step through your code line by line, and it can help you to identify the source of any errors.
* **Ask for help.** If you are stuck on a problem, don't be afraid to ask for help. There are many online resources available, and there are also many people who are willing to help you solve your problems.

CODEFORCES 913_B. Christmas Spruce

Pain points:

 It is a spruce, because every non-leaf vertex has at least 3 leaf children. 1. **Incorrectly counting the number of leaf nodes.** A common mistake is to count the number of leaf nodes in the tree, but not subtracting the number of non-leaf nodes. For example, in the following tree, there are 4 leaf nodes (1, 2, 3, and 4), but 3 non-leaf nodes (5, 6, and 7). So the total number of leaf nodes is 4 - 3 = 1.

```
        5
      / \
     6   7
    / \
   1   2
  / \
 3   4
```

2. **Incorrectly checking if a node is a leaf node.** A leaf node is a node that has no children. So, to check if a node is a leaf node, you need to check if it has any children. For example, in the following tree, the nodes 1, 2, and 3 are all leaf nodes, but the nodes 4, 5, and 6 are not.

```
        5
      / \
     6   7
    / \
   1   2
  / \
 3   4
```

3. **Incorrectly checking if a node has at least 3 leaf children.** A node has at least 3 leaf children if it has 3 or more leaf children. So, to check if a node has at least 3 leaf children, you need to check if it has at least 3 children and all of its children are leaf nodes. For example, in the following tree, the node 5 has at least 3 leaf children because it has 3 children (1, 2, and 3) and all of its children are leaf nodes.

```
        5
      / \
     6   7
    / \
   1   2
  / \
 3   4
```

4. **Incorrectly printing the output.** The output should be either "Yes" or "No". For example, in the following tree, the output should be "Yes" because the tree is a spruce.

CODEFORCES 935_B. Fafa and the Gates

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correct. For example, the input may contain a string of characters that are not 'U' or 'R'.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correct. For example, the output may not be an integer.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of silver coins**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the number of silver coins that Fafa needs to pay. For example, the developer may not consider the fact that Fafa does not pay at the gate at point (0, 0).
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. The developer may not handle edge cases correctly. For example, the developer may not handle the case where Fafa does not move from one kingdom to another.
5. **Incorrect use of data structures**. The developer may incorrectly use data structures to store the information about the gates. For example, the developer may use a data structure that is not efficient for the problem.
6. **Incorrect use of algorithms**. The developer may incorrectly use algorithms to solve the problem. For example, the developer may use an algorithm that is not efficient for the problem.
7. **Incorrect debugging**. The developer may incorrectly debug the code. For example, the developer may not use the right tools to debug the code.

CODEFORCES 961_A. Tetris

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain two integers, `n` and `m`, separated by a space. However, if the input contains an incorrect number of integers, or if the integers are not separated by a space, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the program should print a single integer, the number of points earned. However, if the program prints anything other than an integer, or if the integer is not on its own line, the program will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect calculation of points.** The program must correctly calculate the number of points earned by removing rows of squares. This calculation is not trivial, and there are a number of ways that it can be incorrect. For example, the program might forget to account for the fact that squares can be placed on top of other squares, or it might not correctly calculate the number of rows that are removed when a new square is added.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The program must correctly handle edge cases, such as when the platform is empty or when all of the columns are filled. If the program does not correctly handle these cases, it will be incorrect.
5. **Incorrect use of variables.** The program must use variables correctly in order to correctly calculate the number of points earned. For example, the program must not use the same variable to store two different values, or it must not use a variable that has not been initialized.
6. **Incorrect logic.** The program must have correct logic in order to correctly calculate the number of points earned. For example, the program must not make any assumptions about the input data, and it must not make any mistakes in its calculations.

By following these tips, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving the CODEFORCES 961_A. Tetris problem.

HACKEREARTH ambar-the-gardener-a-3

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect calculation of the volume of the cone and cylinder.** The volume of a cone is given by $\frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the cone and $h$ is the height of the cone. The volume of a cylinder is given by $\pi r^2 h$. If the radius and height of the cone and cylinder are the same, then the volume of the cone is $\frac{1}{3}$ the volume of the cylinder. However, some developers may mistakenly calculate the volume of the cone as $\pi r^2 h$, which would result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect rounding of the answer.** The answer to this problem should be rounded off to the nearest integer. Some developers may forget to round the answer, which would result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect use of the value of pi.** The value of pi is approximately 3.141592653589793. Some developers may use an incorrect value of pi, which would result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect use of the input.** The input to this problem is a positive integer. Some developers may not check the input to ensure that it is a positive integer, which would result in an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect use of the output.** The output to this problem should be a single integer. Some developers may output multiple integers or a string, which would result in an incorrect answer.

### Possible Problems and Bugs

* **Incorrectly identifying the superior of a soldier.** This could occur if the input is not properly formatted or if the code is not properly implemented.
* **Incorrectly updating the energy level of a soldier.** This could occur if the input is not properly formatted or if the code is not properly implemented.
* **Not correctly handling queries of the form "Q S".** This could occur if the code does not properly identify all of the soldiers who have S as their superior.
* **Not correctly handling queries of the form "U S x".** This could occur if the code does not properly update the energy level of the soldier S.
* **Not handling the case where a soldier has multiple superiors.** This could occur if the code does not properly account for the fact that a soldier may have multiple superiors.
* **Not handling the case where a soldier is not assigned a superior.** This could occur if the code does not properly account for the fact that a soldier may not be assigned a superior.
* **Not handling the case where the number of soldiers or the number of queries is too large.** This could occur if the code is not properly designed to handle large inputs.

### Solutions to Possible Problems and Bugs

* To correctly identify the superior of a soldier, the input should be properly formatted and the code should be properly implemented. The input should be in the form of a list of pairs of integers, where each pair represents the relationship between a soldier and his superior. For example, the input `[(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]` represents a hierarchy where soldier 1 is the superior of soldier 2, soldier 2 is the superior of soldier 3, and soldier 3 is the superior of soldier 4. The code should be able to parse this input and correctly identify the superior of each soldier.
* To correctly update the energy level of a soldier, the input should be properly formatted and the code should be properly implemented. The input should be in the form of a pair of integers, where the first integer represents the soldier whose energy level is being updated and the second integer represents the new energy level. For example, the input `(1, 10)` represents a query to update the energy level of soldier 1 to 10. The code should be able to parse this input and correctly update the energy level of the soldier.
* To correctly handle queries of the form "Q S", the code should be able to identify all of the soldiers who have S as their superior. This can be done by traversing the hierarchy of soldiers and adding each soldier who has S as his superior to a set. Once all of the soldiers who have S as their superior have been identified, the sum of their energy levels can be calculated and returned.
* To correctly handle queries of the form "U S x", the code should be able to update the energy level of the soldier S to x. This can be done by simply assigning the value x to the energy level of the soldier S.
* To handle the case where a soldier has multiple superiors, the code should be able to identify all of the soldiers who have S as one of their superiors. This can be done by traversing the hierarchy of soldiers and adding each soldier who has S as one of his superiors to a set. Once all of the soldiers who have S as one of their superiors have been identified, the sum of their energy levels can be calculated and returned.
* To handle the case where a soldier is not assigned a superior, the code should simply return the energy level of the soldier.
* To handle the case where the number of soldiers or the number of queries is too large, the code should be designed to handle large inputs. This can be done by using a data structure that is designed to handle large amounts of data, such as a hash table or a binary search tree.

HACKEREARTH detective-holmes-and-gba

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The problem statement specifies that `N` and `M` are integers, but the code uses `int` for `N` and `float` for `M`. This will cause the code to fail when `M` is not an integer.
2. **Off-by-one error:** The code incorrectly calculates the number of candies that each student should receive. It should be `M // N`, but the code calculates `M / N`. This will cause the code to give the wrong answer when `M` is not a multiple of `N`.
3. **Incorrect logic:** The code incorrectly determines the student who will get the last candy. It should be the student whose index is `(S + M % N) % N`, but the code uses `(S + M) % N`. This will cause the code to give the wrong answer when `M % N` is not 0.

To avoid these problems, the following steps should be taken:

1. Use the correct variable type for `N` and `M`.
2. Make sure that the code correctly calculates the number of candies that each student should receive.
3. Make sure that the code correctly determines the student who will get the last candy.

HACKEREARTH ladder-to-heaven-1

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of data types**

The problem states that the numbers on the ladder are in the following pattern:

```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89
```

However, the input is an integer, which could be any number. This could lead to a bug if the developer tries to use the input as a string. For example, if the input is 100, the developer might try to convert it to a string and then use the string to access the elements of the pattern. This would result in an error because the string does not have any elements.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the sum of the blue cards**

The problem states that the person deserves heaven if and only if the person can tell her sum of all numbers printed on the blue cards. However, the developer might incorrectly calculate the sum of the blue cards. For example, if the ladder has 10 steps, the developer might incorrectly calculate the sum of the blue cards as 10 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 + 89 = 269. This is incorrect because the sum of the blue cards is actually 10 + 8 + 21 + 55 = 94.

**3. Incorrect use of the modulo operator**

The problem states that the numbers on the ladder are in the following pattern:

```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89
```

This pattern can be represented by the following formula:

```
f(n) = n + f(n - 2)
```

where n is the number of the step on the ladder and f(n) is the number on the card on that step. The developer might incorrectly use the modulo operator when calculating the sum of the blue cards. For example, if the ladder has 10 steps, the developer might incorrectly calculate the sum of the blue cards as 10 % 2 + 2 % 2 + 3 % 2 + 5 % 2 + 8 % 2 + 13 % 2 + 21 % 2 + 34 % 2 + 55 % 2 + 89 % 2 = 3. This is incorrect because the sum of the blue cards is actually 10 + 8 + 21 + 55 = 94.

**4. Incorrect use of the bitwise operator**

The problem states that the numbers on the ladder are in the following pattern:

```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89
```

This pattern can be represented by the following formula:

```
f(n) = n + f(n - 2)
```

where n is the number of the step on the ladder and f(n) is the number on the card on that step. The developer might incorrectly use the bitwise operator when calculating the sum of the blue cards. For example, if the ladder has 10 steps, the developer might incorrectly calculate the sum of the blue cards as 10 & 2 + 2 & 2 + 3 & 2 + 5 & 2 + 8 & 2 + 13 & 2 + 21 & 2 + 34 & 2 + 55 & 2 + 89 & 2 = 3. This is incorrect because the sum of the blue cards is actually 10 + 8 + 21 + 55 = 94.

HACKEREARTH monk-and-multiplication

Pain points:
1. **Using the wrong data structure.** The problem asks us to find the product of the largest, second largest, and third largest integers in the range [1, i]. A priority queue is a data structure that can be used to find the largest element in a set of elements. However, a priority queue cannot be used to find the second largest or third largest element in a set of elements.
2. **Not initializing the priority queue correctly.** The priority queue must be initialized with a default constructor that takes no arguments. If the priority queue is not initialized correctly, it will not be able to store any elements.
3. **Adding elements to the priority queue in the wrong order.** The elements must be added to the priority queue in decreasing order of value. If the elements are added in the wrong order, the priority queue will not be able to find the largest, second largest, and third largest elements in the range [1, i].
4. **Not removing elements from the priority queue in the correct order.** The elements must be removed from the priority queue in the same order that they were added. If the elements are removed in the wrong order, the priority queue will not be able to find the largest, second largest, and third largest elements in the range [1, i].
5. **Using the wrong function to find the product of the elements in the priority queue.** The `product()` function should be used to find the product of the elements in the priority queue. The `sum()` function should not be used, because it will return the sum of the elements in the priority queue, not the product.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use a priority queue that can store multiple elements.
* Initialize the priority queue with a default constructor that takes no arguments.
* Add elements to the priority queue in decreasing order of value.
* Remove elements from the priority queue in the same order that they were added.
* Use the `product()` function to find the product of the elements in the priority queue.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly initializing the loop counter.** The loop counter should be initialized to 1, not 0.
2. **Using the wrong comparison operator in the loop condition.** The loop should continue as long as `i < n`, not `i <= n`.
3. **Using the wrong index in the array access.** The `*` character should be printed at index `n - i - 1`, not `n - i`.
4. **Incorrectly formatting the output.** The `*` characters should be separated by a single space, not a newline character.
5. **Using an incorrect value for `n`.** The value of `n` must be greater than 2 and less than or equal to 20.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand what is being asked.
* Carefully write out the solution steps before you start coding.
* Use a debugger to step through your code and check for errors.
* Test your code with a variety of input values to make sure it works correctly.

Title:
HACKEREARTH roy-and-hamming-distance

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly calculating the hamming distance.** The hamming distance between two strings is the number of positions where the two strings differ. To calculate the hamming distance, you need to iterate over the two strings and compare each character. If the two characters are different, then the hamming distance is incremented.
2. **Using an incorrect algorithm to find all permutations of the string.** There are many different algorithms for finding all permutations of a string. The most efficient algorithm is the **lexicographic ordering algorithm**. This algorithm works by iteratively generating all permutations of the string, starting with the empty string.
3. **Using an incorrect modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. When using the modulo operator, it is important to make sure that the divisor is greater than or equal to the dividend. Otherwise, the modulo operator will return a negative number.
4. **Using an incorrect data type.** When working with large numbers, it is important to use the correct data type. The `int` data type is only capable of storing numbers up to 2^31-1. If you need to store a number larger than this, you will need to use the `long` data type.
5. **Not handling errors correctly.** When working with input from the user, it is important to handle errors correctly. For example, if the user enters a string that is not the correct length, you should raise an error.
6. **Not using enough test cases.** When writing code, it is important to write unit tests to verify that your code is working correctly. This will help you to catch bugs early on and prevent them from causing problems in production.

HACKEREARTH string-venture

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect string input format**. The problem statement states that the input string should be on the first line. However, if the input string is not on the first line, the program will not be able to correctly calculate the weight of the string.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the ASCII values of the characters in the string**. The ASCII values of the characters in the string must be added together and then divided by the total number of characters in the string. However, if the calculation is incorrect, the weight of the string will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect rounding of the weight of the string**. The weight of the string must be rounded off to the previous integer. However, if the rounding is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly determine whether the weight of the string is odd or even.
4. **Incorrect identification of the character that is repeated the most number of times in the string**. If the weight of the string is odd, the program must print the character that is repeated the most number of times in the original string. However, if the identification of the character is incorrect, the program will print the wrong character.
5. **Incorrect printing of the reverse of the string**. If the weight of the string is even, the program must print the reverse of the whole string. However, if the printing of the reverse string is incorrect, the program will print the wrong string.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that they understand the input and output formats. They should also carefully calculate the ASCII values of the characters in the string and round the weight of the string to the previous integer. Finally, they should carefully identify the character that is repeated the most number of times in the string and print the reverse of the string correctly.

ATCODER p02598 AtCoder Beginner Contest 174 - Logs

Pain points:
**1. Incorrectly calculating the maximum length of the log after cutting.**

The maximum length of the log after cutting can be calculated by finding the minimum of the sum of the lengths of the two logs after cutting and the length of the original log. For example, if the length of the log is 10 and we cut it at a point 5 units from one end, the two logs will have lengths 5 and 5. The minimum of these two lengths is 5, which is the maximum length of the log after cutting.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm to find the minimum possible length of the longest log.**

One possible algorithm for finding the minimum possible length of the longest log is to sort the logs by their lengths and then repeatedly cut the longest log until the number of cuts reaches K. This algorithm is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the length of the log can change after each cut.

**3. Using an incorrect data structure to store the logs.**

The logs can be stored in a variety of data structures, such as a list, a set, or a heap. The choice of data structure can affect the performance of the algorithm. For example, using a list to store the logs will result in a slower algorithm than using a heap.

**4. Using an incorrect time complexity for the algorithm.**

The time complexity of the algorithm for finding the minimum possible length of the longest log is O(N log N), where N is the number of logs. This is because the logs must be sorted by their lengths before the algorithm can be applied.

**5. Using an incorrect space complexity for the algorithm.**

The space complexity of the algorithm for finding the minimum possible length of the longest log is O(N), where N is the number of logs. This is because the algorithm must store the logs in a data structure.

If N or M is 0, then there are no ways to choose two balls so that the sum of the numbers written on them is even. In this case, the answer is 0.

**3. Not handling the case where N+M is odd**

If N+M is odd, then it is impossible to choose two balls so that the sum of the numbers written on them is even. In this case, the answer is 0.

**4. Using incorrect data types**

The input and output should be given and taken as integers. If they are given or taken as strings, the program will not work correctly.

**5. Making a mistake in the code**

Even if you follow the correct steps, you can still make a mistake in the code. Be careful to check your code carefully for errors.

Title:
ATCODER p02862 AtCoder Beginner Contest 145 - Knight

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**

The modulo operator is used to find the remainder of a division. For example, `10 % 3` would return 1, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.

In this problem, we need to find the number of ways to reach a square on a chessboard, modulo 10^9 + 7. This means that we need to find the remainder of the number of ways to reach the square when divided by 10^9 + 7.

However, some developers might accidentally use the `%` operator instead of the `%` operator. This would result in an incorrect answer, because the `%` operator finds the remainder of a division, not the modulo.

**2. Using the wrong variable names**

It is important to use clear and concise variable names when writing code. This makes the code easier to read and understand, and it reduces the chances of making mistakes.

In this problem, the variables `X` and `Y` are used to represent the coordinates of the square that the knight is trying to reach. However, some developers might accidentally use the variables `x` and `y` to represent the coordinates of the square that the knight is currently on. This would result in an incorrect answer, because the knight would be moving to the wrong square.

**3. Using the wrong algorithm**

The correct algorithm for solving this problem is to use dynamic programming. Dynamic programming is a technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems. This allows us to solve the problem more efficiently, by only having to solve each subproblem once.

Some developers might try to solve this problem using a brute-force algorithm. This would be much slower than using dynamic programming, and it would be more likely to result in a mistake.

**4. Not handling edge cases correctly**

It is important to handle edge cases correctly when writing code. This means that we need to make sure that the code works correctly for all possible inputs.

In this problem, there are two edge cases that we need to handle:

* The square that the knight is trying to reach is outside of the chessboard.
* The knight is already at the square that it is trying to reach.

We need to make sure that the code handles these cases correctly, or the answer will be incorrect.
Test inputs:

Title:
ATCODER p03437 AtCoder Petrozavodsk Contest 001 - Two Integers

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input constraints state that `X` and `Y` are positive integers less than or equal to `10^9`. However, if you try to store `X` and `Y` as `int` variables, you may encounter an overflow error. To avoid this, you should use a larger data type, such as `long` or `unsigned long long`.

**2. Using the wrong operator**

The problem statement states that you need to find a positive integer that is a multiple of `X` but not a multiple of `Y`. However, if you use the `%` operator to check if a number is divisible by `Y`, you may get the wrong answer. This is because the `%` operator returns the remainder of a division, not the quotient. For example, if `X = 8` and `Y = 6`, then `8 % 6 = 2`, which means that `8` is divisible by `6`. However, `8` is not a multiple of `Y`, because it is not equal to `6`.

To avoid this problem, you should use the `/` operator to divide `X` by `Y`. This will give you the quotient, which is the number of times that `Y` goes into `X`. If the quotient is an integer, then `X` is a multiple of `Y`. Otherwise, `X` is not a multiple of `Y`.

**3. Not handling the special case where `X` is divisible by `Y`**

The problem statement does not explicitly state what to do if `X` is divisible by `Y`. However, it is implied that you should print `-1` in this case. To do this, you can check if `X % Y == 0` before you try to find a multiple of `X` that is not a multiple of `Y`. If `X % Y == 0`, then you can simply print `-1` and exit the program.

**4. Not handling the special case where `Y = 1`**

The problem statement does not explicitly state what to do if `Y = 1`. However, it is implied that you should simply print `X` in this case. To do this, you can check if `Y == 1` before you try to find a multiple of `X` that is not a multiple of `Y`. If `Y == 1`, then you can simply print `X` and exit the program.

**5. Not handling the special case where `X = Y`**

The problem statement does not explicitly state what to do if `X = Y`. However, it is implied that you should print `-1` in this case. To do this, you can check if `X == Y` before you try to find a multiple of `X` that is not a multiple of `Y`. If `X == Y`, then you can simply print `-1` and exit the program.

Title:
ATCODER p03596 CODE FESTIVAL 2017 qual A - Squeezing Slimes

Pain points:
**1. Incorrectly calculating the number of operations required.**

The number of operations required to achieve Snuke's goal is equal to the difference between the total size of the slimes and the sum of the sizes of the slimes in the desired configuration. For example, if there are 10 slimes with sizes 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, and 3, the total size of the slimes is 48, and the sum of the sizes of the slimes in the desired configuration is 30. Therefore, the number of operations required is 48 - 30 = 18.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm.**

The following algorithm is incorrect:

```
def find_min_operations(N, a):
  # Initialize the number of operations required.
  operations = 0

  # Iterate over all possible values of M.
  for M in range(2, N + 1, 2):
    # Calculate the number of pairs of slimes that can be formed.
    pairs = N // M

    # Calculate the total size of the slimes in the desired configuration.
    desired_size = pairs * (M // 2) * (a[0] + a[-1])

    # Calculate the difference between the total size of the slimes and the sum of the sizes of the slimes in the desired configuration.
    difference = (N * a[0] + (N - 1) * a[-1]) - desired_size

    # Increment the number of operations required by the difference.
    operations += difference

  # Return the number of operations required.
  return operations
```

This algorithm is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the slimes in the desired configuration may not be contiguous. For example, if there are 10 slimes with sizes 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, and 3, the desired configuration is 3, 9, 5, 3. However, the algorithm will incorrectly calculate the number of operations required as 18, even though the correct number of operations is 10.

**3. Using an inefficient algorithm.**

The following algorithm is inefficient:

```
def find_min_operations(N, a):
  # Initialize the number of operations required.
  operations = 0

  # Iterate over all possible values of M.
  for M in range(2, N + 1, 2):
    # Calculate the number of pairs of slimes that can be formed.
    pairs = N // M

    # Calculate the total size of the slimes in the desired configuration.
    desired_size = pairs * (M // 2) * (a[0] + a[-1])

    # Calculate the difference between the total size of the slimes and the sum of the sizes of the slimes in the desired configuration.
    difference = (N * a[0] + (N - 1) * a[-1]) - desired_size

    # Increment the number of operations required by the difference.
    operations += difference

  # Return the number of operations required.
  return operations
```

This algorithm is inefficient because it iterates over all possible values of M, even though it is only necessary to iterate over the values of M that are less than or equal to the number of slimes in the desired configuration. For example, if there are 10 slimes with sizes 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, and 3, the desired configuration is 3, 9, 5, 3. Therefore, it is only necessary to iterate over the values of M from 2 to 4.

**4. Using a incorrect data structure.**

The following data structure is incorrect:

```
class Slime:
  def __init__(self, size):
    self.size = size

  def __str__(self):
    return str(self.size)
```

This data structure is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the slimes in the desired configuration may not be contiguous. For example, if there are 10 slimes with sizes 3, 1, 4,

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible that the developer will misinterpret the input and make a mistake. For example, the input could be in the form of a list of lists, or it could be in the form of a string. The developer must be careful to parse the input correctly and ensure that it is in the correct format.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of overlaps**. The number of overlaps is calculated by finding the intersection of the two circles. However, it is possible that the developer will make a mistake in this calculation and get the wrong answer. For example, the developer might forget to account for the fact that the circles are not perfectly circular, or they might not correctly account for the fact that the circles are not overlapping perfectly.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly defined, so it is possible that the developer will misinterpret the output and make a mistake. For example, the output could be in the form of a list of integers, or it could be in the form of a string.

Title:
AIZU p01071 Monochrome Tile

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input is given in the format of two integers W and H, separated by blanks. However, the code below tries to assign the input to a string variable. This will cause an error.

```
W, H = input().split()
```

2. **Incorrect index**. The code below tries to access the element at index 0 of the list `a`. However, the list is empty, so this will cause an error.

```
for i in range(len(a)):
    a[0] += 1
```

3. **Off-by-one error**. The code below tries to print the number of tiles filled in black at the end of the work on the i-day on the i-line. However, the index of the list `a` is one less than the day number, so this will cause an error.

```
for i in range(N):
    print(a[i])
```

Title:
AIZU p01341 Save your cats

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a line with more than two integers, or a line with non-integer values.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may not contain a single line, or the output may contain more than one decimal place.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum amount of holy water required.** The developer may incorrectly calculate the minimum amount of holy water required to save all the cats. For example, the developer may forget to take into account the length of the fences or the number of enclosed areas.
4. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.** The developer may incorrectly use floating-point numbers, which can lead to rounding errors. For example, the developer may use a floating-point number with too many decimal places, or the developer may not round the output to the required number of decimal places.
5. **Other bugs.** The developer may make other mistakes in their code, such as typos, logic errors, or memory leaks.

Title:
AIZU p01508 Longest Lane

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly computing the distance between two points.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ can be computed using the formula

$$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$

2. **Not considering all possible paths for the racetrack.** The racetrack can be placed anywhere inside the polygonal boundary, so it is important to consider all possible paths when computing the maximum possible length.

3. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to compute the maximum possible length of the racetrack. The most efficient algorithm is the Graham scan algorithm, which runs in O(n log n) time.

4. **Not handling degenerate cases correctly.** Degenerate cases are cases where the polygonal boundary has a very small area or is self-intersecting. These cases can be handled by using a different algorithm or by making some special-case checks.

5. **Not handling floating-point errors correctly.** Floating-point numbers are not exact, so it is important to take care when computing the maximum possible length of the racetrack. This can be done by using the `round()` function to round the result to the desired precision.

Title:
AIZU p01823 Marching Course

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain spaces between the numbers, or it may contain numbers that are not integers. The developer should check the input format carefully and handle any errors appropriately.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the marching course.** The marching course is calculated by adding the lengths of the segments in the input. The developer should make sure that the lengths of the segments are calculated correctly.
3. **Incorrect output.** The output should be the length of the marching course. The developer should make sure that the output is correct.
4. **Memory leaks.** The developer should use the appropriate memory management techniques to avoid memory leaks.
5. **Bugs in the algorithm.** The developer should carefully design and implement the algorithm to avoid bugs.
6. **Other bugs.** There may be other bugs that the developer may encounter when solving this problem. The developer should carefully test the code to find and fix any bugs.

Title:
AIZU p01958 Prime-Factor Prime

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the `is_prime()` function.** The `is_prime()` function checks if a number is prime. However, it does not check if the number of prime factors of the number is prime. For example, the number 12 is not prime, but the number of its prime factors (3) is prime. Therefore, using the `is_prime()` function to check if a number is a prime-factor prime will result in incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect use of the `factor()` function.** The `factor()` function returns a list of the prime factors of a number. However, it does not return the number of prime factors of the number. For example, the number 12 has three prime factors (2, 2, and 3). However, the `factor()` function will return a list of only two elements (2 and 3). Therefore, using the `factor()` function to get the number of prime factors of a number will result in incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect use of the `len()` function.** The `len()` function returns the length of a list. However, it does not return the number of prime factors of a number. For example, the number 12 has three prime factors (2, 2, and 3). However, the `len()` function will return a value of 2. Therefore, using the `len()` function to get the number of prime factors of a number will result in incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect use of the `range()` function.** The `range()` function returns a sequence of numbers from a starting point to an ending point. However, it does not check if the numbers in the sequence are prime. For example, the `range()` function will return a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10, including 1 and 10. However, 1 and 10 are not prime numbers. Therefore, using the `range()` function to get a sequence of prime numbers will result in incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect use of the `for` loop.** The `for` loop iterates over a sequence of values. However, it does not check if the values in the sequence are prime. For example, the following code will iterate over the sequence of numbers from 1 to 10, including 1 and 10. However, 1 and 10 are not prime numbers. Therefore, using the `for` loop to iterate over a sequence of prime numbers will result in incorrect results.

```
for i in range(1, 11):
    if is_prime(i):
        print(i)
```

Title:
AIZU p02105 Zombie Hunter

Pain points:
**Possible Problems and Bugs**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correct. For example, the first line does not have the correct number of values, or the values are not integers.
* **Incorrect data type:** The input data is not the correct data type. For example, the weight or defense of an armor is not an integer.
* **Off-by-one error:** The code does not account for the fact that the first armor is indexed at 1, not 0.
* **Incorrect logic:** The code does not correctly implement the problem's logic. For example, the code does not check if the total weight or defense of the armor is within the required range.
* **Memory leak:** The code does not properly release memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to a system crash or other problems.
* **Race condition:** The code does not properly protect shared data from being accessed by multiple threads at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or a system crash.
* **Deadlock:** The code creates a situation where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, and no thread can proceed. This can lead to a system deadlock.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design and test your code. You should also use a debugger to help you find and fix errors.

Title:
AIZU p02245 8 Puzzle

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined. For example, the input could be a string of numbers, or a list of numbers, or a 2D array. The developer needs to make sure that the input is in the correct format.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not strictly defined. For example, the output could be a number, or a string, or a list of numbers. The developer needs to make sure that the output is in the correct format.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The developer needs to use the correct algorithm to solve the problem. The most common mistake is to use a brute force algorithm, which will take a long time to run. The developer should use a more efficient algorithm, such as a BFS or DFS algorithm.

**4. Incorrect data structures**

The developer needs to use the correct data structures to store the state of the puzzle and the solution. The most common mistake is to use a 2D array to store the state of the puzzle. This is inefficient because it takes a lot of time to access the elements of the array. The developer should use a more efficient data structure, such as a linked list or a hash table.

**5. Incorrect implementation**

The developer needs to implement the algorithm correctly. The most common mistake is to make a mistake in the logic of the algorithm. The developer should carefully test the algorithm to make sure that it is correct.
