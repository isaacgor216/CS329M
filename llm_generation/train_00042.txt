CODECHEF aran03

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format should be a single integer `T` on the first line, followed by `T` lines of integers `N`. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer `N` for each test case. If the output format is incorrect, the program will produce incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** The program may calculate the stop code incorrectly if it does not account for the first digit of `N`. For example, if `N` is 123, the stop code should be 3, but the program may incorrectly calculate the stop code as 2.
4. **Arithmetic errors.** The program may produce incorrect results if it does not perform arithmetic operations correctly. For example, if `N` is 123, the program may incorrectly calculate the stop code as 124.
5. **Memory errors.** The program may crash if it does not allocate enough memory to store the input and output data.
6. **Timeout errors.** The program may timeout if it takes too long to run.

CODECHEF facteasy

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect factorial calculation.** The most common mistake is to calculate the factorial incorrectly. For example, the factorial of 5 is 120, not 150.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** Be careful not to forget to add 1 to the factorial when calculating it. For example, the factorial of 4 is 24, not 23.
3. **Negative numbers.** The factorial of a negative number is undefined. Make sure to check that the input is a positive number before calculating its factorial.
4. **Zero.** The factorial of 0 is 1. Make sure to handle this case correctly.
5. **Integer overflow.** The factorial of a large number can overflow the integer type. Make sure to use a large enough type to avoid this problem.

Title:
CODECHEF lch15jef

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect modulo operation**

The modulo operation is a mathematical operation that returns the remainder of a division. For example, `10 % 3` returns 1 because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1. When working with large numbers, it is important to be careful with modulo operations, as it is possible to get incorrect results if the numbers are not properly aligned.

In this problem, the developer may have incorrectly performed the modulo operation on the expression `2**3*3**1`. The correct answer is 24, but the developer may have mistakenly calculated the remainder of `2**3` and `3**1` separately and then added the results, which would give an incorrect answer of 27.

**2. Incorrect exponentiation operation**

The exponentiation operation is a mathematical operation that raises a number to a power. For example, `2**3` is equal to 8. When working with large numbers, it is important to be careful with exponentiation operations, as it is possible to get incorrect results if the numbers are not properly aligned.

In this problem, the developer may have incorrectly performed the exponentiation operation on the expression `11**2*2**4`. The correct answer is 1936, but the developer may have mistakenly calculated the product of `11**2` and `2**4` separately and then exponentiated the result, which would give an incorrect answer of 448.

**3. Incorrect input handling**

The input for this problem is a string that contains a positive integer M and an expression S. The developer may have incorrectly handled the input, which could lead to incorrect results.

For example, the developer may have assumed that the input string would always be in the correct format, when in reality it could contain invalid characters. This could lead to the developer incorrectly parsing the input and computing an incorrect answer.

**4. Incorrect output handling**

The output for this problem is a single integer that represents the value of the expression S modulo M. The developer may have incorrectly handled the output, which could lead to incorrect results.

For example, the developer may have assumed that the output integer would always be positive, when in reality it could be negative. This could lead to the developer incorrectly formatting the output and producing an incorrect answer.

**5. Incorrect time complexity**

The time complexity of the solution is important, as it determines how long the program will take to run. The developer may have implemented a solution with a time complexity that is too high, which could lead to the program running slowly or even crashing.

For example, the developer may have implemented a solution that recursively computes the value of the expression S. This would have a time complexity of O(n!), which would be prohibitively slow for large values of n.

**6. Incorrect space complexity**

The space complexity of the solution is important, as it determines how much memory the program will use. The developer may have implemented a solution with a space complexity that is too high, which could lead to the program running out of memory.

For example, the developer may have implemented a solution that stores the entire expression S in memory. This would have a space complexity of O(n), which could be prohibitively large for large values of n.

Title:
CODECHEF permut2

Pain points:
ambiguous
not ambiguous 1. **Using the wrong data type for the input.** The input consists of integers, so you should use an integer data type to store them. For example, `int n = 0;`.
2. **Not handling the case where `n == 0`.** The last test case is `0`, which indicates the end of input. If you don't handle this case, your program will crash.
3. **Not checking if the input is valid.** The input should contain a single integer on the first line, followed by a permutation of the integers 1 to `n` on the second line. If the input is not valid, you should print an error message and exit.
4. **Not using the correct algorithm to check if the permutation is ambiguous.** The algorithm for checking if a permutation is ambiguous is as follows:
    1. Sort the permutation in ascending order.
    2. If the sorted permutation is the same as the inverse permutation, then the permutation is ambiguous.
    3. Otherwise, the permutation is not ambiguous.
5. **Not printing the correct output.** The output should be `ambiguous` if the permutation is ambiguous, and `not ambiguous` if the permutation is not ambiguous.

Here is an example of a correct solution:

```
def main():
    n = int(input())
    permutation = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Check if the input is valid.
    if n == 0:
        print(0)
        return

    # Sort the permutation in ascending order.
    permutation.sort()

    # Check if the sorted permutation is the same as the inverse permutation.
    inverse_permutation = [i + 1 for i in range(n)]
    if permutation == inverse_permutation:
        print("ambiguous")
    else:
        print("not ambiguous")

Title:
CODECHEF stkenc

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of data types**. The problem states that the input number N can be as large as 10^12, so the data type used to store N should be long long. However, the following code uses int to store N, which can lead to overflow errors:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        // Error: integer overflow
        int len = n / 26 + (n % 26 != 0);
        cout << len << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

2. **Incorrect logic**. The problem states that the encryption is a string made up of alphabets (a-z) such that the "sum of the rank of letters" is equal to the number N. However, the following code does not correctly implement this logic:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        int len = n / 26 + (n % 26 != 0);
        // Error: the string does not have the correct sum of ranks
        string s = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            s += 'a';
        }
        cout << s << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The correct solution is as follows:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        int len = n / 26 + (n % 26 != 0);
        string s = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            s += (char)('a' + (n - 26 * i) % 26);
        }
        cout << s << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}

Title:
CODEFORCES 1076_D. Edge Deletion

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm.**

Dijkstra's algorithm is a well-known algorithm for finding the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. However, it is important to implement the algorithm correctly, as a mistake can lead to incorrect results.

One common mistake is to use the wrong data structure to store the distances to the vertices. For example, if you use a list to store the distances, you may end up with a quadratic time complexity. Instead, you should use a heap to store the distances, which will give you a linear time complexity.

Another common mistake is to use the wrong order to visit the vertices. When you are visiting the vertices, you should always visit the vertex with the smallest distance first. This will ensure that you find the shortest paths to all of the vertices.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm.**

The greedy algorithm is a simple algorithm that can be used to find a local optimum. In this problem, we can use the greedy algorithm to find a set of edges that maximizes the number of good vertices.

One common mistake is to not consider all of the possible edges when making a decision. For example, you might only consider the edges that are adjacent to the current vertex. However, you should also consider the edges that are not adjacent to the current vertex, as they may be able to connect to other good vertices.

Another common mistake is to not update the set of good vertices after making a decision. For example, you might add an edge to the set of good edges, but you might not update the set of good vertices. This can lead to incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect implementation of the sorting algorithm.**

Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science, and it is important to implement it correctly. In this problem, we can use sorting to order the edges by their weights. This will allow us to find the edges that should be deleted first.

One common mistake is to use the wrong sorting algorithm. For example, you might use bubble sort, which has a quadratic time complexity. Instead, you should use a sorting algorithm with a linear time complexity, such as quicksort or merge sort.

Another common mistake is to not consider the ties when sorting the edges. For example, you might sort the edges by their weights, but you might not break ties in any way. This can lead to incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect implementation of the data structures.**

Data structures are used to store and organize data in a computer program. In this problem, we can use data structures to store the vertices, edges, and distances.

One common mistake is to use the wrong data structure for the problem. For example, you might use a linked list to store the vertices, but this would have a quadratic time complexity. Instead, you should use a data structure with a linear time complexity, such as an array or a hash table.

Another common mistake is to not use the data structures correctly. For example, you might not initialize the data structures properly, or you might not use the data structures in the correct way. This can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect use of data types.** Be careful when using data types in your code. For example, if you are working with large numbers, you should use `long long` instead of `int`.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** These are errors that occur when you forget to add or subtract one from a number. Make sure to check your code carefully for these types of errors.
4. **Indexing errors.** These are errors that occur when you index into an array or list incorrectly. Make sure to check your code carefully for these types of errors.
5. **Memory errors.** These are errors that occur when your program allocates too much or too little memory. Make sure to use the `malloc` and `free` functions correctly to avoid these types of errors.
6. **Floating-point errors.** These are errors that occur when you work with floating-point numbers. Make sure to use the `round` function to avoid these types of errors.
7. **Recursion errors.** These are errors that occur when you use recursion incorrectly. Make sure to understand the base case and the recursive case of your recursive function.
8. **Synchronization errors.** These are errors that occur when multiple threads access the same data at the same time. Make sure to use locks and mutexes to avoid these types of errors.
9. **Race conditions.** These are errors that occur when two threads try to access the same data at the same time and the outcome depends on the order in which the threads access the data. Make sure to use locks and mutexes to avoid these types of errors.
10. **Deadlocks.** These are errors that occur when two threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, and neither thread can ever release the lock. Make sure to use locks and mutexes carefully to avoid these types of errors.

CODEFORCES 1145_A. Thanos Sort

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Thanos sort algorithm.** The Thanos sort algorithm works by repeatedly snapping your fingers to remove the first or second half of the items in the array. This process is repeated until the array is sorted. However, if the implementation of the Thanos sort algorithm is incorrect, it may not be able to correctly sort the array. For example, if the algorithm incorrectly removes the first half of the array when the array is already sorted, it will not be able to sort the array.
2. **Incorrect input handling.** The input to the Thanos sort problem is a list of integers. The integers in the list represent the elements of the array to be sorted. If the input is not handled correctly, the Thanos sort algorithm may not be able to correctly sort the array. For example, if the input list contains non-integer values, the Thanos sort algorithm will not be able to sort the array.
3. **Incorrect output handling.** The output of the Thanos sort problem is the length of the longest sorted subarray in the array. If the output is not handled correctly, the Thanos sort algorithm may not be able to correctly return the length of the longest sorted subarray. For example, if the output is not a positive integer, the Thanos sort algorithm will not be able to correctly return the length of the longest sorted subarray.
4. **Runtime errors.** The Thanos sort algorithm can be implemented in a variety of ways. Some implementations of the Thanos sort algorithm may be more efficient than others. If the Thanos sort algorithm is not implemented efficiently, it may run into runtime errors. For example, if the Thanos sort algorithm is implemented in a recursive fashion, it may run into a stack overflow error.
5. **Memory errors.** The Thanos sort algorithm can be implemented in a variety of ways. Some implementations of the Thanos sort algorithm may use more memory than others. If the Thanos sort algorithm is not implemented efficiently, it may run into memory errors. For example, if the Thanos sort algorithm is implemented in a recursive fashion, it may run into a stack overflow error.

 After the third addition:

7 47 87 7

 1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is also not always correctly followed. For example, the output may not be on a single line, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. This can also lead to incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over an array, it is easy to make an off-by-one error and skip or repeat an element. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Arithmetic errors.** When performing arithmetic operations, it is easy to make a mistake and get an incorrect result. This can also lead to incorrect results.
5. **Memory errors.** When allocating memory for an array or other data structure, it is easy to make a mistake and allocate too much or too little memory. This can lead to incorrect results or a program crash.
6. **Logic errors.** When writing the logic for a program, it is easy to make a mistake and have the program do something unintended. This can lead to incorrect results or a program crash.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement, and to test your code thoroughly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1305_D. Kuroni and the Celebration

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the tree data structure.** This is the most common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. Make sure that your tree data structure is implemented correctly and that you are able to perform basic operations on it, such as finding the parent of a vertex, finding the children of a vertex, and checking if two vertices are connected by an edge.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the lowest common ancestor (LCA) algorithm.** The LCA algorithm is a recursive algorithm that takes two vertices as input and returns the lowest common ancestor of those two vertices. There are many different implementations of the LCA algorithm, so make sure that you are using one that is correct.
3. **Incorrect use of the LCA algorithm.** The LCA algorithm is a powerful tool, but it can be easy to misuse. Make sure that you are using the LCA algorithm correctly and that you are not making any mistakes in your implementation.
4. **Insufficient number of queries.** The problem states that Kuroni can only use the LCA app at most ⌊n/2⌋ times. If you make more than ⌊n/2⌋ queries, the program will print -1 and you will receive a Wrong answer verdict. Make sure that you are only making ⌊n/2⌋ queries.
5. **Incorrect output format.** The problem states that you must print "! r" when you find the vertex r. Make sure that you are printing this output correctly and that you are not printing any extra lines.
6. **Idleness limit exceeded.** If you do not print end of line and flush the output after each query, you may get an Idleness limit exceeded verdict. Make sure that you are printing end of line and flushing the output after each query.

Here are some additional tips that may help you avoid these problems:

* Use a debugger to help you track down errors in your code.
* Test your code on small input sets before submitting it to the judge.
* Read the problem statement carefully and make sure that you understand all of the requirements.
* Ask for help from other programmers if you are stuck.
Test inputs:
**Incorrect implementation of the tree data structure:**

```
n = int(input())
edges = []
for i in range(n-1):
    edges.append(list(map(int, input().split())))

def find_parent(v):
    if v == -1:
        return v
    return find_parent(edges[v][0])

def lca(u, v):
    if find_parent(u) == find_parent(v):
        return u
    else:
        return lca(find_parent(u), find_parent(v))

queries = int(input())
for _ in range(queries):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    print(lca(u, v))
```

This program will incorrectly find the lowest common ancestor of two vertices. For example, if the input is `n = 3`, `edges = [[1, 2], [2, 3]]`, and `queries = 1`, then the program will output `3` instead of `1`. This is because the program incorrectly finds the parent of vertex `3` to be vertex `2` instead of vertex `1`.

**Incorrect implementation of the lowest common ancestor (LCA) algorithm:**

```
n = int(input())
edges = []
for i in range(n-1):
    edges.append(list(map(int, input().split())))

def find_parent(v):
    if v == -1:
        return v

    return lca(edges[u][0], v)

queries = int(input())
for _ in range(queries):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    print(lca(u, v))
```

This program will incorrectly find the lowest common ancestor of two vertices. For example, if the input is `n = 3`, `edges = [[1, 2], [2, 3]]`, and `queries = 1`, then the program will output `2` instead of `1`. This is because the program incorrectly finds the parent of vertex `3` to be vertex `2` instead of vertex `1`.

**Incorrect use of the LCA algorithm:**

```
n = int(input())
edges = []
for i in range(n-1):
    edges.append(list(map(int, input().split())))

def find_parent(v):
    if v == -1:
        return v
    return find_parent(edges[v][0])

def lca(u, v):
    if find_parent(u) == find_parent(v):

    return lca(find_parent(u), v)

queries = int(input())
for _ in range(queries):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    print(lca(u, v))
```

This program will incorrectly find the lowest common ancestor of two vertices. For example, if the input is `n = 3`, `edges = [[1, 2], [2, 3]]`, and `queries = 1`, then the program will output `2` instead of `1`. This is because the program incorrectly uses the LCA algorithm to find the parent of vertex `3` instead of finding the lowest common ancestor of vertices `u` and `v`.

**Insufficient number of queries:**

```
n = int(input())

CODEFORCES 132_A. Turing Tape

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be a single line of text. If the input is not in the correct format, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect ASCII codes**. The ASCII codes of the characters in the input should be between 32 and 126, inclusive. If a character has an ASCII code outside of this range, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will likely crash.
3. **Incorrect array output**. The output should be a list of integers, one per line. If the output is not in the correct format, the program will not be able to be graded correctly.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. When processing the input, it is important to keep track of the current character and the previous character. If a character is processed incorrectly, it can cause an off-by-one error in the output.
5. **Memory leaks**. The program should free up any memory that it allocates when it is finished running. If the program does not free up memory, it can eventually run out of memory and crash.
6. **Race conditions**. If multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is important to ensure that the data is accessed in a consistent manner. If the data is accessed incorrectly, it can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
7. **Synchronization errors**. When multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is important to ensure that the data is synchronized correctly. If the data is not synchronized correctly, it can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1349_F1. Slime and Sequences (Easy Version)

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the dynamic programming algorithm.**

The dynamic programming algorithm for this problem is relatively straightforward, but it is important to get the implementation correct. One common mistake is to forget to update the dp table when the current value of `n` is greater than the previous value. Another common mistake is to use the wrong base case for the dp table.

**2. Incorrect handling of edge cases.**

The problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ n ≤ 5000`, but some solutions will fail to work correctly for inputs that are close to these limits. For example, a solution that uses an array to store the dp table will overflow if `n` is too large.

**3. Incorrect use of modular arithmetic.**

The problem statement specifies that the output should be modulo 998244353. Some solutions will fail to work correctly if this modulus is not used correctly. For example, a solution that uses floating-point arithmetic will not produce the correct results.

**4. Incorrect use of the Sieve of Eratosthenes.**

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a useful tool for finding all of the prime numbers up to a given limit. However, some solutions will fail to work correctly if the Sieve of Eratosthenes is not used correctly. For example, a solution that uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all of the prime numbers up to `n` will not work correctly if `n` is not a prime number.

**5. Incorrect use of the Chinese remainder theorem.**

The Chinese remainder theorem is a powerful tool for solving systems of congruences. However, some solutions will fail to work correctly if the Chinese remainder theorem is not used correctly. For example, a solution that uses the Chinese remainder theorem to solve a system of congruences with multiple variables will not work correctly if the variables are not pairwise coprime.

2. **The program may not find a valid partition of the points into two sets.** In this case, the program should output "NO" and terminate.
3. **The program may find a valid partition of the points into two sets, but the output may be incorrect.** For example, the program may output the same point twice in the same set, or it may output a point that is not one of the input points.
4. **The program may be inefficient.** For example, it may take a long time to run on large inputs.
5. **The program may be incorrect even on small inputs.** For example, it may output the wrong answer for a simple input.

This input has eight points, and there is a valid partition of them into two sets of four points each so that the points in each set lie at the vertexes of a square or a rectangle. However, the program may output the following incorrect answer:

```
YES

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The variable `n` should be of type `int`, but it is declared as `str`. This will cause a `TypeError` when the program is run.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator:** The expression `n == '3'` is comparing the variable `n` to the string `'3'`. This will cause a `ValueError` when the program is run.
3. **Incorrect indentation:** The code block inside the `for` loop is not indented correctly. This will cause the program to skip over the loop body.
4. **Missing semicolon:** The statement `print(n)` is missing a semicolon at the end. This will cause a `SyntaxError` when the program is run.
5. **Incorrect variable assignment:** The variable `i` is assigned the value of `n + 1`. This will cause the variable to be out of bounds of the array `arr`.
6. **Off-by-one error:** The loop iterates over the array `arr` one too many times. This will cause the program to print the wrong output.
7. **Logic error:** The program does not correctly check if the player is being attacked by two other players. This will cause the program to output the wrong answer.
8. **Incorrect use of a function:** The function `min()` is used to find the minimum value in the array `arr`. However, the function is not being used correctly.
9. **Memory leak:** The program does not free the memory that is allocated for the array `arr`. This will cause the program to eventually run out of memory.
10. **Security vulnerability:** The program does not properly validate user input. This could allow a malicious user to exploit the program.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format specifies that the input should be a single integer n. However, if the input contains multiple integers, or if it contains non-integer characters, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format specifies that the output should be a single integer. However, if the output contains multiple integers, or if it contains non-integer characters, the program will be incorrect.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When computing the number of ways to make two round dances, it is important to make sure that you account for all possible cases.

**4. Math errors**

When computing the number of ways to make two round dances, it is important to make sure that you use the correct mathematical formulas. For example, if n is even, the number of ways to make two round dances is not equal to n / 2!.

**5. Runtime errors**

The program may run into runtime errors if it is not properly optimized. For example, if the program uses a naive algorithm to compute the number of ways to make two round dances, it may run out of memory or time.

**6. Logical errors**

The program may contain logical errors if it is not properly designed. For example, the program may not correctly account for all possible cases, or it may make incorrect assumptions about the input data.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1458_D. Flip and Reverse

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very strict. It allows for a single integer T on the first line, followed by T lines of input strings. However, some developers may not be aware of this and try to read the input in a different format, such as T lines of integers. This will cause the program to crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also not very strict. It allows for a single line of output for each test case, with the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained from the input string after zero or more operations. However, some developers may not be aware of this and try to print multiple lines of output, or print the output in a different format. This will cause the program to receive a wrong answer.

**3. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The algorithm for this problem is fairly simple. It involves repeatedly finding the longest substring of the input string that contains an equal number of 0's and 1's, flipping the substring, and then reversing the substring. However, some developers may make mistakes in their implementation of this algorithm, such as using the wrong data structure to store the substrings, or forgetting to check for edge cases. This will cause the program to produce incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect handling of errors**

The program should handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input file does not exist, the program should print an error message and exit. If the input file is empty, the program should also print an error message and exit. If the input file contains invalid data, the program should print an error message and exit.

**5. Inefficient implementation**

The program can be implemented in a very inefficient way. For example, the developer could use a brute-force algorithm to find the longest substring of the input string that contains an equal number of 0's and 1's. This would take O(n^2) time, where n is the length of the input string. A more efficient algorithm would use a divide-and-conquer approach to find the longest substring in O(n log n) time.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1508_E. Tree Calendar

Pain points:
**1. Incorrectly counting the number of days passed.**

The problem states that "Touko performs this procedure once:

* Among all directed edges u → v such that a_u < a_v, select the edge u' → v' with the lexicographically smallest pair (a_{u'}, a_{v'}).
* Swap a_{u'} and a_{v'}."

So, the number of days passed should be equal to the number of times Touko swapped two labels. However, some developers might incorrectly count the number of days passed by counting the number of edges in the tree. This is incorrect because Touko might not swap every edge in the tree.

**2. Not considering the direction of the edges.**

The problem states that "Every edge in this tree is directed away from the root." So, when Touko swaps two labels, she must swap the labels of the two nodes that are connected by an edge that is directed away from the root. Some developers might incorrectly swap the labels of two nodes that are connected by an edge that is directed towards the root. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**3. Using an incorrect DFS algorithm.**

The problem states that "After calling dfs(1) the following algorithm returns a as a DFS order of a tree rooted at 1 :

order := 0
a := array of length n

function dfs(u):
    order := order + 1
    a[u] := order
    for all v such that there is a directed edge (u -> v):
        dfs(v)"

Some developers might use an incorrect DFS algorithm, such as a DFS algorithm that does not visit all nodes in the tree. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**4. Not handling all possible cases.**

The problem states that "Touko likes the present so much she decided to play with it! On each day following the wedding day, Touko performs this procedure once:

* Among all directed edges u → v such that a_u < a_v, select the edge u' → v' with the lexicographically smallest pair (a_{u'}, a_{v'}).
* Swap a_{u'} and a_{v'}."

Some developers might not handle all possible cases, such as the case where there are no edges in the tree or the case where there are no edges that are directed away from the root. This will result in an incorrect answer.

Title:
CODEFORCES 162_C. Prime factorization

Pain points:
**1. Using a naive approach to find all prime factors**

A naive approach to finding all prime factors of a number `n` is to iterate over all numbers from 2 to `n` and check if each number is a prime factor of `n`. This approach is inefficient because it will iterate over many numbers that are not prime factors of `n`.

**2. Using a Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers less than or equal to `n`**

A Sieve of Eratosthenes is a more efficient way to find all prime numbers less than or equal to a given number. The Sieve of Eratosthenes works by first creating a list of all the numbers from 2 to `n`. Then, it iteratively marks each number that is not prime as composite. A number is marked as composite if it is divisible by any number that has already been marked as composite. The Sieve of Eratosthenes terminates when all of the numbers from 2 to `n` have been marked as composite or prime.

Once the Sieve of Eratosthenes has terminated, the list of prime numbers less than or equal to `n` can be easily obtained by iterating over the list of numbers from 2 to `n` and only including the numbers that have not been marked as composite.

**3. Using a divide-and-conquer algorithm to find all prime factors of `n`**

A divide-and-conquer algorithm can be used to find all prime factors of `n` by recursively dividing `n` by the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of `n`. The prime factors of `n` are then the numbers that remain after all of the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of `n` have been divided out.

**4. Using a dynamic programming algorithm to find all prime factors of `n`**

A dynamic programming algorithm can be used to find all prime factors of `n` by iteratively building up a table of all the prime factors of the numbers from 2 to `n`. The prime factors of `n` can then be easily obtained by looking up the values in the table.

**5. Using a probabilistic algorithm to find all prime factors of `n`**

A probabilistic algorithm can be used to find all prime factors of `n` by randomly sampling numbers from the range of 2 to `n` and checking if each number is a prime factor of `n`. This algorithm is not guaranteed to find all prime factors of `n`, but it is very efficient.

**6. Using a heuristic algorithm to find all prime factors of `n`**

A heuristic algorithm can be used to find all prime factors of `n` by using a set of rules to guess which numbers are prime factors of `n`. This algorithm is not guaranteed to find all prime factors of `n`, but it can be very efficient.

**7. Using a brute-force algorithm to find all prime factors of `n`**

The brute-force algorithm is the simplest algorithm to find all prime factors of `n`. It simply iterates over all numbers from 2 to `n` and checks if each number is a prime factor of `n`. This algorithm is very inefficient, but it is guaranteed to find all prime factors of `n`.

Title:
CODEFORCES 253_C. Text Editor

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect data type

The input format of the problem specifies that the first line should contain an integer n, but the following code will not work:

```
n = input()
```

This is because `input()` returns a string, not an integer. To convert the string to an integer, you can use the `int()` function:

```
n = int(input())
```

### 2. Incorrect index

The problem states that the cursor's position is determined by a pair of integers (r, c), where r is the number of the line and c is the cursor's position in the line. However, the following code will not work:

```
r = int(input())
c = int(input())
```

This is because the input format specifies that the first line contains n integers, not two integers. To get the correct values for r and c, you need to split the input string into two parts:

```
n = int(input())
a = input().split()
r = int(a[0])
c = int(a[1])
```

### 3. Incorrect calculation

The problem states that Vasya can move the cursor up, down, left, or right. However, the following code will not work:

```
if c < a[r - 1]:
    move = "Up"
elif c > a[r - 1]:
    move = "Down"
else:
    move = "Left" or "Right"
```

This is because the `or` operator only returns the first value that evaluates to True. In this case, both `c < a[r - 1]` and `c > a[r - 1]` evaluate to False, so the `or` operator will return `None`. To fix this, you can use the `elif` statement:

```
if c < a[r - 1]:
    move = "Up"
elif c > a[r - 1]:
    move = "Down"
else:
    move = "Left"
```

### 4. Incorrect output

The problem states that the output should be a single integer, but the following code will not work:

```
print(move)
```

This is because the `print()` function prints a string, not an integer. To fix this, you can cast the value of `move` to an integer:

```
print(int(move))
```

CODEFORCES 300_C. Beautiful Numbers

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**

The modulo operator (%) is used to find the remainder of a division. In the problem statement, we are told that the answer should be modulo 1000000007. However, if you accidentally use the modulo operator (%) instead of the modulo operator (%), you will get the wrong answer.

For example, if the input is (1, 3, 3), the correct answer is 1. However, if you use the modulo operator (%), you will get the answer 3.

**2. Not using the modpow function**

The modpow function is a very useful function that can be used to calculate the power of a number modulo another number. In the problem statement, we are told that the answer should be modulo 1000000007. However, if you try to calculate the power of a number modulo 1000000007 manually, you will get the wrong answer.

For example, if the input is (1, 3, 3), the correct answer is 1. However, if you try to calculate the power of 3 modulo 1000000007 manually, you will get the answer 2.

**3. Using the wrong base**

The base of a number is the number that is used to represent the number. In the problem statement, we are told that the numbers are represented in decimal. However, if you accidentally use a different base, you will get the wrong answer.

For example, if the input is (1, 3, 3), the correct answer is 1. However, if you accidentally use the binary base, you will get the answer 11.

**4. Not using the correct number of digits**

The problem statement states that the numbers are represented in decimal. However, if you accidentally use a different number of digits, you will get the wrong answer.

For example, if the input is (1, 3, 3), the correct answer is 1. However, if you accidentally use only two digits, you will get the answer 10.

When working with large numbers, it is important to be careful with modulo operations. For example, 10 ** 18 % 10 ** 9 + 7 is not equal to 10 ** 18. This is because 10 ** 18 % 10 ** 9 + 7 is equal to 10 ** 18 - (10 ** 9 + 7) * (10 ** 9) / (10 ** 9 + 7). This value is not equal to 10 ** 18 because the division (10 ** 9 + 7) * (10 ** 9) / (10 ** 9 + 7) does not produce an integer.
2. **Incorrect use of the Fibonacci sequence.** The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers. For example, the Fibonacci sequence is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ... The first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1. This means that the third term of the Fibonacci sequence is 1 + 1 = 2. The fourth term of the Fibonacci sequence is 2 + 1 = 3. The fifth term of the Fibonacci sequence is 3 + 2 = 5. And so on.
3. **Incorrect use of the Catalan numbers.** The Catalan numbers are a sequence of numbers that are used in combinatorics. The Catalan numbers are defined by the following recurrence relation:

```
Cn = (2n)! / (n! * (n + 1)!)
```

For example, the first few Catalan numbers are 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, ... The Catalan numbers can be used to count the number of ways to arrange n non-overlapping brackets. For example, there are 5 ways to arrange 3 non-overlapping brackets:

```
()()
(())
(()())
(())()
((()))
```

4. **Incorrect use of the Lucas numbers.** The Lucas numbers are a sequence of numbers that are closely related to the Fibonacci numbers. The Lucas numbers are defined by the following recurrence relation:

```
Ln = Ln-1 + Ln-2
```

where L0 = 2 and L1 = 1. For example, the first few Lucas numbers are 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, ... The Lucas numbers can be used to count the number of ways to walk around a grid of n squares, starting in the top left corner and ending in the bottom right corner. For example, there are 7 ways to walk around a 3 x 3 grid:

```
```

5. **Incorrect use of the golden ratio.** The golden ratio is a special number approximately equal to 1.618. The golden ratio is often used in art and design. The golden ratio can be found in many natural objects, such as the spiral of a nautilus shell.

6. **Incorrect use of the Fibonacci heap.** The Fibonacci heap is a data structure that is used to implement priority queues. The Fibonacci heap is a heap that is based on the Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci heap is a very efficient data structure.

7. **Incorrect use of the Catalan tree.** The Catalan tree is a tree data structure that is used to represent the Catalan numbers. The Catalan tree is a very efficient data structure.

8. **Incorrect use of the Lucas tree.** The Lucas tree is a tree data structure that is used to represent the Lucas numbers. The Lucas tree is a very efficient data structure.

9. **Incorrect use of the golden ratio tree.** The golden ratio tree is a tree data structure that is used to represent the golden ratio. The golden ratio tree is a very efficient data structure.

CODEFORCES 443_D. Andrey and Problem

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n, and the second line should contain n real numbers. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the probability**. The probability that Andrey will not get upset is equal to the probability that at least one of his friends comes up with a problem and the probability that he does not get more than one problem. The probability that at least one of his friends comes up with a problem is equal to the sum of the probabilities that each individual friend comes up with a problem. The probability that he does not get more than one problem is equal to the product of the probabilities that each individual friend does not come up with more than one problem. If the program incorrectly calculates any of these probabilities, the output will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the output should be a single real number. If the output is not a real number, or if it is not formatted correctly, the program will not be able to correctly output the answer.
4. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other potential bugs that could occur when solving this problem, such as incorrect use of pointers, memory leaks, and race conditions. It is important to carefully test the program to ensure that it is free of bugs before submitting it to Codeforces.

prob = list(map(float, input().split()))
print(sum(prob))
```

This program correctly parses the input and calculates the probability that Andrey will not get upset. However, it does not correctly format the output. The output should be a single real number, but this program outputs a list of real numbers.

2. ```
n = int(input())
prob = list(map(float, input().split()))
prob = [1 - x for x in prob]
print(sum(prob) * prod(prob))
```

This program correctly parses the input and calculates the probability that Andrey will not get upset. It also correctly formats the output. However, the program does not correctly calculate the probability that Andrey does not get more than one problem. The probability that he does not get more than one problem is equal to the product of the probabilities that each individual friend does not come up with more than one problem. In this program, the probability that each individual friend does not come up with more than one problem is calculated as 1 - p, where p is the probability that the friend comes up with a problem. However, this is not correct. The correct probability is 1 - p^2.

3. ```
n = int(input())
prob = list(map(float, input().split()))
prob = [1 - x for x in prob]
prob = [x**2 for x in prob]

```

This program incorrectly calculates the probability that Andrey will not get upset. The probability that Andrey will not get upset is equal to the probability that at least one of his friends comes up with a problem and the probability that he does not get more than one problem. The probability that at least one of his friends comes up with a problem is equal to the sum of the probabilities that each individual friend comes up with a problem. The probability that he does not get more than one problem is equal to the product of the probabilities that each individual friend does not come up with more than one problem. In this program, the probability that at least one of his friends comes up with a problem is calculated as sum(prob), where prob is the list of probabilities that each individual friend comes up with a problem. However, this is not correct. The correct probability is sum(prob > 0).

6. ```
n = int(input())
prob = list(map(float, input().split()))
prob = [1 - x for x in prob]
prob = [x**2 for x in prob]

CODEFORCES 465_E. Substitutes in Number

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always strictly followed, and this can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a space between two digits, the program may interpret this as two separate digits and give an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement may not explicitly specify all of the edge cases that need to be handled, and this can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a negative number, the program may not handle this correctly and give an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The program may use data structures in an incorrect way, which can lead to errors. For example, if the program uses a linked list to store a set of numbers, it may not be able to efficiently find the numbers that it needs, which can lead to an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** The program may use algorithms in an incorrect way, which can lead to errors. For example, if the program uses a bubble sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers, it may not be able to sort the list efficiently, which can lead to an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The program may not handle errors correctly, which can lead to the program crashing or giving incorrect results. For example, if the program tries to divide by zero, it may not handle this correctly and crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 538_D. Weird Chess

Pain points:
**Possible Problems and Bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, or if the input contains a character that is not a letter, the program will crash.
* **Incorrect output format.** The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if the output contains a character that is not a letter, or if the output is not the same length as the input, the program will crash.
* **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program is the most important part, and it is easy to make a mistake here. For example, if the program does not check if the piece is attacking itself, or if the program does not check if the piece is attacking another piece, the program will give the wrong answer.
* **Incorrect implementation.** The implementation of the program is also important, and it is easy to make a mistake here. For example, if the program uses the wrong data structure, or if the program uses the wrong algorithm, the program will run slowly or give the wrong answer.

CODEFORCES 566_E. Restoring Map

Pain points:
1 3 **1. Using an incorrect data structure**

One of the most common mistakes is to use an incorrect data structure to store the graph. For example, using an array to store the adjacency list of a graph can lead to incorrect results.

**2. Not handling all possible cases**

Another common mistake is to not handle all possible cases. For example, if the input graph is not connected, then the algorithm will not be able to find a spanning tree.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

Finally, using an incorrect algorithm can also lead to incorrect results. For example, using a depth-first search algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree will not always give the correct answer.

**4. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. This can be done by creating a set of test cases and running your code on them.

**5. Not using the right tools**

There are a number of tools available that can help you to solve graph problems. For example, you can use a graph visualization tool to help you visualize the graph and identify any problems.

**6. Not understanding the problem**

The most important step in solving any problem is to understand the problem. This means understanding the input, the output, and the constraints. If you do not understand the problem, then you will not be able to solve it correctly.

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain an extra space, or a number may be missing. The developer should check the input format carefully and handle incorrect input gracefully.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is also not always correct. For example, the output may contain a space, or a number may be missing. The developer should check the output format carefully and make sure that the output is correct.
3. **Incorrect calculation.** The developer may make a mistake when calculating the number of candies to take. For example, the developer may forget to add or subtract a number, or the developer may use the wrong formula. The developer should carefully check the calculation and make sure that the answer is correct.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program. For example, the developer may not consider all possible cases, or the developer may use the wrong algorithm. The developer should carefully check the logic of the program and make sure that the program works correctly.
Test inputs:
**Incorrect input format:**

```
1 1
a
1 2 1
```

This input is incorrect because the first line does not contain two integers. The developer should check the input format carefully and handle incorrect input gracefully.

**Incorrect output format:**

```
1 1
a
1 2 1
12
```

This output is incorrect because the output does not contain a single integer. The developer should check the output format carefully and make sure that the output is correct.

**Incorrect calculation:**

```
1 1
a
1 2 1
11
```

This calculation is incorrect because the developer forgot to add 1 to the number of candies to take. The developer should carefully check the calculation and make sure that the answer is correct.

**Incorrect logic:**

```
1 1
a
1 2 1
1
```

This logic is incorrect because the developer only considered the case where the first letter of the name is the same as the first letter of the substring. The developer should carefully check the logic of the program and make sure that the program works correctly.
Title:
CODEFORCES 60_B. Serial Time!

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when parsing it. For example, if you forget to add a space between the numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The input data is represented as a string, but the program needs to work with integers. If you try to convert the string to an integer without first checking if it is a valid number, the program will crash.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When working with arrays, it is easy to make a mistake and access an element that is out of bounds. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**4. Infinite loops**

If the program does not have any way to terminate, it will run forever. This can happen if the program is not properly designed or if there is a bug in the code.

**5. Memory leaks**

The program may allocate memory that it does not need, which can eventually lead to a memory leak. This can cause the program to slow down or crash.

**6. Race conditions**

When multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is possible for them to interfere with each other. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.

**7. Deadlocks**

When two threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, they can deadlock. This means that neither thread can continue running, and the program will eventually crash.

**8. Security vulnerabilities**

The program may be vulnerable to attacks if it does not properly validate user input. This could allow attackers to gain access to the program's data or even take control of the program.

**9. Incorrect algorithm**

The program may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. This could cause the program to produce incorrect results or take longer than necessary to run.

**10. Inefficient code**

The program may be inefficiently written, which could cause it to run slower than necessary. This could be due to a number of factors, such as using inefficient data structures or algorithms, or making unnecessary copies of data.

Title:
CODEFORCES 725_E. Too Much Money

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input value `c` is a positive integer, but it may be incorrectly interpreted as a float. This can lead to errors in the calculation of the minimum value of the coins.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator**. The problem statement states that the value of the coins in `S` must not exceed `c`. However, the code may incorrectly compare `S` with `c` using the `==` operator. This can lead to errors in the calculation of the minimum value of the coins.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The problem statement states that Alfred's algorithm can fail even when there is a set of coins with value exactly `c`. However, the code may incorrectly check if the value of the coins in `S` is equal to `c`. This can lead to errors in the calculation of the minimum value of the coins.
4. **Infinite loop**. The code may enter an infinite loop if it does not properly check for the end of the input. This can lead to the program crashing or running indefinitely.
5. **Memory leak**. The code may leak memory if it does not properly free the memory allocated for the coins in `S`. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

CODEFORCES 747_E. Comments

Pain points:

 **Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format**. The input format is very specific and it is easy to make a mistake when writing it. For example, if you forget to put a comma between the comment text and the number of replies, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
* **Incorrect data**. The data given in the input may not be correct. For example, the number of replies to a comment may be negative or greater than the number of comments in the input. If the data is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce the correct output.
* **Incorrect implementation**. The program may be incorrectly implemented, which could lead to incorrect output. For example, the program might not correctly handle the case where a comment has multiple replies.
* **Runtime errors**. The program may run into runtime errors, such as running out of memory or crashing. This could be caused by a variety of factors, such as incorrect implementation or incorrect data.
* **Other errors**. There are a number of other possible errors that could occur when solving this problem. For example, the program might not be able to handle all of the possible input cases.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always strictly followed, and this can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input is not a single integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the sum of digits.** The sum of digits can be calculated incorrectly if the digits are not added in the correct order. For example, if the digits are added from right to left, the sum will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect output.** The output may not be in the correct format, or it may not contain the correct integer. For example, the output may contain leading zeros, or it may not be a positive integer.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The program must be able to handle edge cases, such as when the input is 0 or 1.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The program must be able to handle errors gracefully, such as when the input is not a valid integer.

Title:
CODEFORCES 794_E. Choosing Carrot

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the game rules**

The game is played as follows:

1. Oleg makes k moves.
2. Igor makes one move.
3. Oleg makes one move.
4. Igor makes one move.
5. ...
6. The game ends when only one carrot remains.

However, some implementations may incorrectly implement the game rules as follows:

1. Oleg makes k moves.
2. Igor makes one move.
3. Oleg makes one move.
4. Igor makes one move.
5. ...
6. The game ends when only one carrot remains, **or when both players have no more moves**.

This incorrect implementation would result in the wrong answer being returned.

**2. Using a brute-force approach**

A brute-force approach to solving this problem would be to enumerate all possible ways for Oleg to make his k moves, and then to find the optimal way for Igor to respond to each of Oleg's moves. This approach would be very inefficient, as the number of possible ways for Oleg to make his k moves grows exponentially with k.

**3. Not considering the order in which the carrots are eaten**

The order in which the carrots are eaten is important, as it affects the juiciness of the remaining carrots. For example, if Oleg eats the two most juicy carrots first, then Igor will be able to eat the two least juicy carrots, which will result in the remaining carrot being less juicy than if Oleg had eaten the two least juicy carrots first.

**4. Not considering the fact that Oleg always moves first**

Oleg always moves first, which gives him an advantage over Igor. This advantage is even greater if Oleg makes k moves before the game starts, as he can then choose which carrots to eat and in what order.

**5. Not considering the fact that Igor always moves second**

Igor always moves second, which gives him a disadvantage over Oleg. This disadvantage is even greater if Oleg makes k moves before the game starts, as Igor will be forced to eat the carrots that Oleg has left behind.

**6. Not considering the fact that the game ends when only one carrot remains**

The game ends when only one carrot remains. This means that Oleg and Igor cannot both eat the same carrot, and that Oleg cannot eat the last carrot.

**7. Not considering the fact that the carrots are arranged in a line**

The carrots are arranged in a line, which means that the order in which they are eaten matters. For example, if Oleg eats the two most juicy carrots first, then Igor will be able to eat the two least juicy carrots, which will result in the remaining carrot being less juicy than if Oleg had eaten the two least juicy carrots first.

**8. Not considering the fact that Oleg wants to maximize the juiciness of the carrot**

Oleg wants to maximize the juiciness of the carrot, which means that he should eat the most juicy carrots first.

**9. Not considering the fact that Igor wants to minimize the juiciness of the carrot**

Igor wants to minimize the juiciness of the carrot, which means that he should eat the least juicy carrots first.

**10. Not considering the fact that Oleg can make k moves before the game starts**

Oleg can make k moves before the game starts, which gives him an advantage over Igor. This advantage is even greater if Oleg makes k moves before the game starts, as he can then choose which carrots to eat and in what order.

Title:
CODEFORCES 815_D. Karen and Cards

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very well-defined. It is not clear whether the numbers in the input should be separated by spaces or commas. This could lead to errors if the developer does not correctly parse the input.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also not very well-defined. It is not clear whether the output should be a single integer or a list of integers. This could lead to errors if the developer does not correctly format the output.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

The problem statement specifies that there are n cards in the collection. However, the input only contains n-1 lines of data. This could lead to an off-by-one error if the developer does not correctly account for the missing line of data.

**4. Incorrect use of loops**

The problem statement requires the developer to iterate over all of the cards in the collection. However, the developer may accidentally iterate over the cards more than once or not enough times. This could lead to incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect use of conditional statements**

The problem statement requires the developer to check whether a card beats all of the cards in the collection. However, the developer may accidentally check whether a card beats only some of the cards in the collection. This could lead to incorrect results.

**6. Incorrect use of mathematical operations**

The problem statement requires the developer to perform a number of mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. However, the developer may accidentally perform these operations incorrectly. This could lead to incorrect results.

**7. Incorrect use of data structures**

The problem statement requires the developer to use data structures to store the cards in the collection and the cards that beat all of the cards in the collection. However, the developer may accidentally use the wrong data structures or use them incorrectly. This could lead to incorrect results.

**8. Incorrect use of algorithms**

The problem statement requires the developer to use an algorithm to find all of the cards that beat all of the cards in the collection. However, the developer may accidentally use the wrong algorithm or use it incorrectly. This could lead to incorrect results.

```

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is not very clear, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading in the data. For example, if you forget to include the space between the two integers in the first line, the program will crash.
* **Incorrect array initialization:** The array `a` is initialized with the values from the input data, but it is possible to make a mistake when copying the values into the array. For example, if you forget to add a comma after the last value in the input data, the program will crash.
* **Incorrect calculation of the answer:** The answer to each query is the minimum value that occurs in the interval `l, r` strictly more than `k` times. It is possible to make a mistake when calculating this value, for example, if you forget to check that the value is actually in the interval `l, r`.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format for this problem is to print the answer to each query on a new line. It is possible to make a mistake when printing the output, for example, if you forget to add a newline character after each answer.

By following these tips, you can avoid these common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 932_A. Palindromic Supersequence

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly defining the palindrome.** A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward or backward. This means that the first and last characters must be the same, and the second and second-to-last characters must be the same, and so on. For example, the string "abba" is a palindrome because it reads the same backward and forward. However, the string "abcba" is not a palindrome because the first and last characters are not the same.
2. **Not considering all possible palindromes.** When finding a palindrome that is a supersequence of a given string, it is important to consider all possible palindromes. For example, if the given string is "abc", then the palindromes "abcba" and "cbacba" are both valid solutions.
3. **Using an inefficient algorithm.** There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to find a palindrome that is a supersequence of a given string. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. For example, the brute-force algorithm will check every possible palindrome, which can be very time-consuming. However, there are more efficient algorithms that can be used, such as the Manacher algorithm.
4. **Incorrectly handling special cases.** There are a number of special cases that need to be handled when finding a palindrome that is a supersequence of a given string. For example, if the given string is empty, then the empty string is the only possible palindrome.
5. **Not validating the output.** When finding a palindrome that is a supersequence of a given string, it is important to validate the output to ensure that it is correct. For example, the output should be a palindrome, and it should be a supersequence of the given string.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. **Be sure to correctly define the palindrome.** Make sure that you understand what a palindrome is and how to check if a string is a palindrome.
2. **Consider all possible palindromes.** When finding a palindrome that is a supersequence of a given string, it is important to consider all possible palindromes. This can be done by using an algorithm that generates all possible palindromes of a given length.
3. **Use an efficient algorithm.** There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to find a palindrome that is a supersequence of a given string. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. When choosing an algorithm, it is important to consider the size of the input string and the desired runtime.
4. **Handle special cases correctly.** There are a number of special cases that need to be handled when finding a palindrome that is a supersequence of a given string. Be sure to understand these special cases and how to handle them correctly.
5. **Validate the output.** When finding a palindrome that is a supersequence of a given string, it is important to validate the output to ensure that it is correct. This can be done by checking that the output is a palindrome and that it is a supersequence of the given string.

CODEFORCES 959_B. Mahmoud and Ehab and the message

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correctly followed, and this can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format must be exactly as specified in the problem statement. For example, if the problem statement says that the output should be a single integer, but the program outputs a string, the program will be incorrect.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that occurs when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a program that outputs the wrong answer or a program that crashes.

**4. Logical errors**

Logical errors occur when a programmer makes a mistake in the logic of the program. For example, a program might incorrectly check if a condition is true, or it might incorrectly calculate a value. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a program that outputs the wrong answer or a program that crashes.

**5. Memory leaks**

Memory leaks occur when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

**6. Race conditions**

Race conditions occur when two or more parts of a program try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a program that outputs the wrong answer or a program that crashes.

The input data contains a lot of integers. If you use the wrong data type to store them, you may get incorrect results. For example, if you use `int` to store `A`, `B`, and `C`, you may get an overflow error when calculating the team rank.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks you to calculate the total sum of ranks over all possible valid teams. A valid team is a team that consists of three players and no pair of players in the team has a conflict. The rank of the team is calculated using the following algorithm: let `i`, `j`, and `k` be the ranks of players in the team and `i < j < k`, then the rank of the team is equal to `A * i + B * j + C * k`.

A naive algorithm to solve this problem is to iterate over all possible teams and calculate their ranks. However, this algorithm is very inefficient. For example, if there are `n` players, there are `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 6` possible teams. Evaluating the rank of each team takes `O(1)` time, so the total running time of this algorithm is `O(n^3)`.

A more efficient algorithm is to use dynamic programming. The idea is to construct a table `dp[i][j][k]`, where `i`, `j`, and `k` are the ranks of the three players in the team. The value of `dp[i][j][k]` is the sum of ranks of all valid teams that contain the players with ranks `i`, `j`, and `k`.

We can construct the table `dp` in a bottom-up fashion. For each `i`, `j`, and `k`, we first check if the players with ranks `i`, `j`, and `k` have a conflict. If they do not have a conflict, we add the rank of the team to `dp[i][j][k]`.

Once we have constructed the table `dp`, we can find the total sum of ranks of all valid teams by summing the values of `dp` over all possible values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

The problem asks you to calculate the total sum of ranks over all possible valid teams modulo 2^64. This means that you need to take into account the fact that the sum of ranks of all possible teams may overflow. To avoid this, you need to use the modulo operator when calculating the sum of ranks.

**4. Incorrect boundary conditions**

The problem states that `0 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 10^6`. However, you may accidentally use a larger value for `A`, `B`, or `C`. This will cause an overflow error.

**5. Incorrect data format**

The problem states that the input data contains two space-separated integers `n` and `m`. However, you may accidentally read the data in a different format. This will cause a parsing error.

**6. Incorrect output format**

The problem states that you need to print a single integer. However, you may accidentally print multiple integers or a string. This will cause a formatting error.

Title:
HACKEREARTH add-subtract

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The problem statement mentions that the input array consists of integers, but the code below uses `str` type for the array. This will cause a `TypeError` when the code tries to perform arithmetic operations on the array elements.
2. **Incorrect loop condition**. The problem statement says that the array contains `N` elements, but the code below uses a `for` loop with a condition of `i < n`. This will cause the loop to run one iteration too many, which will result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum cost**. The problem statement says that the cost of incrementing an element is 3 and the cost of decrementing an element is 5. However, the code below calculates the cost of incrementing an element as 4 and the cost of decrementing an element as 6. This will result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect use of the `min()` function**. The problem statement asks for the minimum cost required to get `K` equal elements in the array. However, the code below uses the `min()` function to find the minimum cost of incrementing or decrementing a single element. This will not give the correct answer.

To fix these problems, we can do the following:

1. Change the variable type of the array to `int`.
2. Change the loop condition to `i < N`.
3. Correct the calculation of the minimum cost.
4. Use the `min()` function to find the minimum cost of getting `K` equal elements in the array.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def main():
    # Get the number of test cases.
    T = int(input())

    # Loop through the test cases.
    for _ in range(T):
        # Get the number of elements in the array and the value of K.
        N, K = map(int, input().split())

        # Get the array of elements.
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))

        # Initialize the minimum cost to infinity.
        min_cost = float('inf')

        # Iterate through all the elements in the array.
        for i in range(N):
            # Calculate the cost of incrementing or decrementing the current element to get K equal elements.
            inc_cost = 3 * (K - A[i])
            dec_cost = 5 * (A[i] - K)

            # Update the minimum cost if the current cost is less than the minimum cost so far.
            min_cost = min(min_cost, inc_cost, dec_cost)

        # Print the minimum cost.
        print(min_cost)

**1. The input may contain invalid characters.** The input should only contain `b`, `r` and `w` characters. If the input contains any other characters, the program should raise an error.
2. **The input may not be a valid string.** The input should be a string of characters. If the input is not a string, the program should raise an error.
3. **The input may not be a valid length.** The input should be a string of length `N`. If the input is not a string of length `N`, the program should raise an error.
4. **The program may not correctly count the number of beads of each color.** The program should correctly count the number of beads of each color. If the program does not correctly count the number of beads of each color, the output may be incorrect.
5. **The program may not correctly find the point where the band should be broken.** The program should correctly find the point where the band should be broken. If the program does not correctly find the point where the band should be broken, the output may be incorrect.
6. **The program may not correctly output the maximum number of beads that can be collected.** The program should correctly output the maximum number of beads that can be collected. If the program does not correctly output the maximum number of beads that can be collected, the output may be incorrect.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

1. **Use regular expressions to validate the input.** Regular expressions can be used to check if the input contains invalid characters, if the input is a valid string, and if the input is a string of length `N`.
2. **Use a data structure to store the beads.** A data structure such as a hash table or a linked list can be used to store the beads. This will make it easier to count the number of beads of each color and to find the point where the band should be broken.
3. **Use a greedy algorithm to find the point where the band should be broken.** A greedy algorithm can be used to find the point where the band should be broken so that the most number of beads can be collected.
4. **Test your program thoroughly.** Test your program with a variety of inputs, including valid and invalid inputs, to make sure that it is working correctly.

Title:
HACKEREARTH just-shut-up

Pain points:
**1. Using recursion to calculate factorial**

Recursion is a powerful tool, but it can also be dangerous. If you're not careful, you can end up with a stack overflow error. To avoid this, you need to make sure that your recursive function has a base case that it can fall back on. In this case, the base case would be when the number is 0 or 1.

**2. Using the wrong data type**

When calculating factorials, you need to use a data type that can handle large numbers. If you use a data type that is too small, you will end up with an overflow error. In this case, you should use a `long` data type.

**3. Not handling negative numbers correctly**

The factorial of a negative number is undefined. If you try to calculate the factorial of a negative number, you will get an error. In this case, you should check if the number is negative and return 1 if it is.

**4. Not handling zero correctly**

The factorial of 0 is 1. If you forget to handle this case, you will get the wrong answer. In this case, you should check if the number is 0 and return 1 if it is.

**5. Not using the modulus operator correctly**

The modulus operator (`%`) returns the remainder of a division operation. This means that it will return the last digit of a number. However, if the number is negative, the modulus operator will return the wrong answer. In this case, you need to first make the number positive before using the modulus operator.

**6. Not handling overflow correctly**

When calculating factorials, you can easily overflow the data type that you are using. This can happen if the factorial is too large. To avoid this, you need to check if the factorial is about to overflow and return the last digit if it is.

HACKEREARTH palindromes-twist

Pain points:
### Possible Problems and Bugs

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line of input will contain the number of test cases `t`. However, if the input format is incorrect, such as if the first line contains a number other than `t`, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the output should be a single integer which is the minimum cost of replacing `/` by `a` and `b` such that the string finally becomes a palindrome. However, if the output format is incorrect, such as if the output contains multiple integers or non-integer values, the program will not be able to correctly parse the output and will likely crash.
3. **Incorrect calculation of minimum cost**. The minimum cost of replacing `/` by `a` and `b` such that the string finally becomes a palindrome is the sum of the costs of replacing each `/`. However, if the program incorrectly calculates the cost of replacing a `/`, such as if it incorrectly assumes that the cost of replacing a `/` with `a` is the same as the cost of replacing a `/` with `b`, the program will not be able to correctly find the minimum cost and will likely return an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect handling of invalid input**. The input may contain invalid values, such as a string that does not contain any `/` characters or a string that is not of even length. If the program does not correctly handle invalid input, such as by crashing or returning an incorrect answer, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

## How to Avoid These Problems

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully follow the input and output format specifications. Additionally, it is important to correctly calculate the minimum cost of replacing `/` by `a` and `b` and to correctly handle invalid input. Here are some specific tips for avoiding these problems:

* **Use regular expressions to parse the input.** This will help to ensure that the input is correctly formatted and that no invalid values are entered.
* **Use a dynamic programming algorithm to calculate the minimum cost.** This will ensure that the minimum cost is correctly calculated, even for large strings.
* **Use exception handling to handle invalid input.** This will ensure that the program does not crash if invalid input is entered.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs that developers may encounter when solving this problem.

Title:
HACKEREARTH riyas-birthday-party-1

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not specified.** The input format is not specified in the problem statement. This could lead to a bug if the developer assumes that the input format is a certain way, but it is actually different. For example, the developer might assume that the input is a list of integers, but it could actually be a list of strings.

**2. The output format is not specified.** The output format is also not specified in the problem statement. This could lead to a bug if the developer assumes that the output format is a certain way, but it is actually different. For example, the developer might assume that the output is a list of integers, but it could actually be a list of strings.

**3. The problem statement is not clear.** The problem statement is not very clear. This could lead to a bug if the developer misinterprets the problem statement. For example, the developer might think that the array is always increasing, when it is actually not.

**4. The problem is too difficult.** The problem is quite difficult. This could lead to a bug if the developer tries to solve the problem in a way that is too complex. For example, the developer might try to use a recursive solution, when a simpler iterative solution would be more efficient.

**5. The developer makes a mistake in their code.** Even the best developers make mistakes. This could lead to a bug if the developer makes a mistake in their code. For example, the developer might forget to initialize a variable, or they might use the wrong mathematical formula.

Title:
HACKEREARTH square-mode

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of Euler's criterion.** Euler's criterion states that if $p$ is prime and $a$ is not divisible by $p$, then $a^{\phi(p)} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$. This means that if $a$ is not divisible by $p$, then $a^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ if and only if $\phi(p)$ is even. However, some developers mistakenly apply Euler's criterion to cases where $a$ is divisible by $p$. In this case, $a^{\phi(p)} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ does not necessarily imply that $a^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$.
2. **Incorrect handling of negative numbers.** Euler's criterion only applies to positive integers. Some developers mistakenly apply it to negative integers, which can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect handling of modular arithmetic.** Modular arithmetic is a type of arithmetic where the numbers are taken modulo a fixed number, called the modulus. This means that when two numbers are added or subtracted, the result is also modulo the modulus. For example, if the modulus is 10, then 5 + 7 = 2, because 5 + 7 = 12, which is equivalent to 2 modulo 10. Some developers mistakenly perform modular arithmetic incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect handling of floating-point numbers.** Floating-point numbers are a type of number that can represent both positive and negative numbers, as well as decimals. However, floating-point numbers are not always precise, which can lead to incorrect results when performing calculations with them. Some developers mistakenly use floating-point numbers when they should be using integers, which can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** Overflow occurs when a number is too large to be represented in the given data type. This can lead to incorrect results when performing calculations with large numbers. Some developers mistakenly do not check for overflow, which can lead to incorrect results.
6. **Incorrect handling of underflow.** Underflow occurs when a number is too small to be represented in the given data type. This can lead to incorrect results when performing calculations with small numbers. Some developers mistakenly do not check for underflow, which can lead to incorrect results.

Title:
HACKEREARTH tripping-on-nothingness

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the modulus operator.** The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 returns 1. This means that 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.
2. **Using the wrong data type.** The modulus operator can only be used with integers. If you try to use it with a floating-point number, you will get an error.
3. **Not using the modulus operator correctly.** The modulus operator is often used to check if a number is divisible by another number. For example, you can check if a number is divisible by 3 by using the following code:

```
if (number % 3 == 0):
  # The number is divisible by 3.
else:
  # The number is not divisible by 3.
```

4. **Not handling edge cases.** When using the modulus operator, it is important to handle edge cases. For example, what happens if you try to divide a number by 0?

5. **Using the modulus operator in a loop.** The modulus operator can be used in a loop to iterate over a range of numbers. For example, the following code will print the numbers from 1 to 10:

```
for number in range(1, 11):
  print(number)
```

6. **Using the modulus operator in a conditional statement.** The modulus operator can be used in a conditional statement to check if a number meets a certain criteria. For example, the following code will print "Divisible by 3" if a number is divisible by 3:

```
if (number % 3 == 0):
  print("Divisible by 3")
else:
  print("Not divisible by 3")

Title:
ATCODER p02580 AtCoder Beginner Contest 176 - Bomber

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains integers, so we should use the `int` data type to store them. However, if we accidentally use the `float` data type, we may get incorrect results. For example, if we store the number `1000000000` as a `float`, it will be rounded to `1000000000.0`, which is not an integer. This can lead to errors in our calculations.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the maximum number of targets that can be destroyed. One possible algorithm is to iterate through all possible positions for the bomb and find the position that destroys the most targets. However, this algorithm is very inefficient. A more efficient algorithm is to use a dynamic programming approach.

**3. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

The problem states that `1 <= H, W <= 3 * 10^5`. This means that the maximum value of `H` or `W` is `3 * 10^5`. However, if we accidentally use a value that is greater than `3 * 10^5`, our program may crash.

**4. Not handling errors correctly**

The problem may contain invalid input. For example, the input may contain a negative number or a number that is too large. If we do not handle these errors correctly, our program may crash or give incorrect results.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it. This will help you to catch any errors that you may have missed. You can test your code by using a sample input and output. You can also use a testing framework to help you test your code.

ATCODER p02711 AtCoder Beginner Contest 162 - Lucky 7

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of this problem is `N`, where `N` is a three-digit integer. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output of this problem should be either `Yes` or `No`. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly output the answer and will likely crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of this problem is relatively simple. The program should check if the input number contains the digit 7. If it does, the program should print `Yes`. Otherwise, the program should print `No`. If the logic of the program is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem and will likely output the wrong answer.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. When checking if a number contains a particular digit, it is important to be careful about off-by-one errors. For example, if the number is 123 and you are checking if it contains the digit 4, you will need to check the digits 1, 2, and 3. If you only check the digits 2 and 3, you will miss the digit 4.
5. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other potential bugs that a developer could encounter when solving this problem. Some common examples include:
    * Using the wrong data type for the input number
    * Using the wrong comparison operator to check if the number contains the digit 7
    * Using an incorrect loop to iterate through the digits of the number
    * Misusing the `print()` function to output the answer

Title:
ATCODER p02840 AtCoder Beginner Contest 147 - Sum Difference

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect variable type**

The input variables `N`, `X`, and `D` are all integers, but the code below incorrectly defines them as floats. This will cause the program to crash when it tries to perform arithmetic operations on them.

```
N = float(input())
X = float(input())
D = float(input())
```

**2. Off-by-one error**

The code below incorrectly calculates the number of possible values of S - T. It starts by subtracting `X` from `N` to get the number of elements in the sequence that Takahashi will take. However, this is one less than the actual number of elements, because Takahashi will also take the first element in the sequence. To fix this, we need to add one to the number of elements that Takahashi will take.

```
num_elements = N - 1
```

**3. Infinite loop**

The code below contains an infinite loop. The loop is triggered when the value of `i` is equal to `N`. However, the value of `i` is never incremented, so the loop will never terminate. To fix this, we need to increment the value of `i` inside the loop.

```
for i in range(N):
    # Do something
```

**4. Undefined variable**

The code below uses the variable `sum_takahashi`, but this variable is never initialized. This will cause the program to crash when it tries to access the value of `sum_takahashi`. To fix this, we need to initialize the variable before using it.

```
sum_takahashi = 0
```

**5. Incorrect logic**

The code below incorrectly calculates the number of possible values of S - T. It starts by adding the first element in the sequence to the sum of the elements that Takahashi will take. However, this is incorrect because Takahashi will not take the first element in the sequence. To fix this, we need to subtract the first element in the sequence from the sum of the elements that Takahashi will take.

Title:
ATCODER p03114 World Tour Finals 2019 Open Contest - Multiple of Nine

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operation**

When calculating the number of strings that satisfy the conditions, it is important to use the correct modulo operation. In this problem, the modulo operation should be performed using 10^9 + 7. If a different modulo operation is used, the answer will be incorrect.

**2. Forgetting to consider leading zeroes**

When counting the number of strings that satisfy the conditions, it is important to consider leading zeroes. For example, the string `002019` represents the integer 2019. If leading zeroes are not considered, the answer will be incorrect.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. It is important to choose an algorithm that is efficient enough to solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time.

**4. Making a mistake in the implementation**

Even if the algorithm is correct, a mistake in the implementation can lead to an incorrect answer. It is important to carefully check the implementation to ensure that there are no mistakes.

**5. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code to ensure that it is correct. This can be done by running the code on a number of test cases. If the code does not pass all of the test cases, it is necessary to find and fix the errors.

Title:
ATCODER p03260 AtCoder Beginner Contest 109 - ABC333

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The problem states that A and B are integers between 1 and 3. If you accidentally use a data type that is larger than an integer, such as a float, you may get unexpected results.

**2. Using the wrong operator**

The problem states that you need to find an integer C between 1 and 3 such that A * B * C is an odd number. If you accidentally use the wrong operator, such as `+` instead of `*`, you will get the wrong answer.

**3. Not handling all possible cases**

The problem states that A and B are integers between 1 and 3. However, it is possible that A or B is equal to 3. If you do not handle this case, your code will not work correctly.

**4. Using an incorrect algorithm**

Title:
ATCODER p03576 AtCoder Beginner Contest 075 - Axis-Parallel Rectangle

Pain points:
The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading in the data. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will likely crash.
* **Incorrect algorithm:** The algorithm used to solve this problem must be correct in order to get the correct answer. There are a few different ways to solve this problem, but some algorithms are more efficient than others.
* **Incorrect implementation:** Even if the algorithm is correct, the implementation must be correct in order to get the correct answer. This means that all of the details of the algorithm must be implemented correctly, and there must be no bugs in the code.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format for this problem is specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if you forget to add a newline character at the end of the output, the program will likely crash.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to carefully design and implement the algorithm, and to thoroughly test the code before submitting it.

Title:
ATCODER p03733 AtCoder Regular Contest 073 - Sentou

Pain points:
**1. Using a list to store the time intervals between each push of the switch**

This is a common mistake that many people make when solving this problem. The reason why this is a problem is because the list will not be able to store the time intervals correctly if the intervals are not in ascending order. For example, if the intervals are [0, 3, 5, 7], the list will store them as [0, 5, 7, 3], which is not correct.

**2. Not taking into account the fact that the shower will emit water for T seconds when the switch is pushed**

This is another common mistake that many people make. The reason why this is a problem is because the shower will not emit water for T additional seconds if the switch is pushed when the shower is already emitting water. For example, if the shower is emitting water for 5 seconds and the switch is pushed, the shower will not emit water for 5 + T seconds, it will only emit water for T seconds.

**3. Not taking into account the fact that the shower will emit water for a total of T seconds**

This is the most important mistake that people make when solving this problem. The reason why this is a problem is because the shower will only emit water for a total of T seconds, regardless of how many times the switch is pushed. For example, if the shower is emitting water for 5 seconds and the switch is pushed 10 times, the shower will only emit water for a total of 5 seconds.

**4. Using the wrong formula to calculate the total time that the shower will emit water**

The correct formula to calculate the total time that the shower will emit water is:

```
total_time = T * (N + 1)
```

where:

* N is the number of people who push the switch
* T is the number of seconds that the shower emits water when the switch is pushed

**5. Not using the right data type to store the time intervals**

The time intervals between each push of the switch should be stored as integers. This is because the time intervals can be very large, and storing them as floats can lead to rounding errors.

Title:
ATCODER p03895 CODE FESTIVAL 2016 Relay (Parallel) - Early Bird

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data contains a lot of integers, so it is easy to make a mistake when choosing the data type. For example, if you use `int` to store the input data, you may get an overflow error. To avoid this, you should use a larger data type, such as `long long`.

**2. Not handling the edge cases**

The problem statement mentions that "a day consists of 86400 seconds". This means that the maximum value of `a_i` and `b_i` is 86400. However, if you forget to handle this edge case, your program may crash. To avoid this, you should check that `a_i` and `b_i` are less than or equal to 86400.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The problem statement asks you to find the maximum possible number of times Takahashi wakes up early. To do this, you need to find the minimum value of `a_i + b_i` for all `i`. However, if you use incorrect logic, you may get the wrong answer. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
min_value = 86400
for i in range(N):
    min_value = min(min_value, a_i + b_i)
print(min_value)
```

This code will not work because it does not take into account the fact that `a_i + b_i` can be greater than 86400. To fix this, you need to add the following line of code:

```
if min_value > 86400:
    min_value = 86400
```

**4. Not using a fast enough algorithm**

The problem statement asks you to find the maximum possible number of times Takahashi wakes up early. This can be done in O(N) time using a simple greedy algorithm. However, if you use a slower algorithm, your program may not finish in time.

**5. Not using enough memory**

The problem statement does not mention how much memory you can use. However, if you use too much memory, your program may crash. To avoid this, you should only use the amount of memory that you need.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is specified as "Height of mountain 1
Height of mountain 2
Height of mountain 3
.
.
Height of mountain 10", but the developer may accidentally use a different format, such as "Height of mountain 1, 2, 3
Height of mountain 4, 5, 6
.
.
Height of mountain 10, 11, 12". This would cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is specified as "Height of the 1st mountain
Height of the 2nd mountain
Height of the 3rd mountain", but the developer may accidentally output the heights in a different order, such as "Height of the 3rd mountain
Height of the 2nd mountain
Height of the 1st mountain". This would cause the output to be incorrect.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer may accidentally iterate over the array of heights one element too many or one element too few, which would cause the program to output incorrect results.
4. **Indexing errors**. The developer may accidentally index the array of heights incorrectly, which would also cause the program to output incorrect results.
5. **Memory errors**. The developer may not allocate enough memory for the array of heights, which would cause the program to crash.
6. **Floating-point errors**. The developer may accidentally use floating-point numbers when they should be using integers, or vice versa. This could cause the program to produce incorrect results.
7. **Data races**. The developer may not properly synchronize access to the array of heights, which could cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer may accidentally introduce a security vulnerability, such as a buffer overflow or a SQL injection vulnerability. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the program or its data.
9. **Other bugs**. There are many other possible bugs that a developer could introduce when solving this problem. These include logic errors, race conditions, and security vulnerabilities. It is important to carefully test the program to ensure that it is free of bugs before deploying it to production.

1/1 0/1

### Possible Problems

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain a prime number that is greater than 10000, or the input may contain a negative integer.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed. For example, the output may contain a rational number that is not irreducible, or the output may not be separated by a space character.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to find the two rational numbers may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not find two rational numbers that are both less than √p, or the algorithm may not find two rational numbers that are both greater than √p.
4. **Incorrect data type**. The data types used to store the prime number and the integer n may be incorrect. For example, the prime number may be stored as a floating-point number, or the integer n may be stored as a string.
5. **Incorrect variable names**. The variable names used to store the prime number and the integer n may be confusing. For example, the variable name for the prime number may be the same as the variable name for the integer n.

### Possible Bugs

1. **Off-by-one error**. The algorithm may miss one of the two rational numbers. For example, the algorithm may find the rational number x / y, but it may not find the rational number u / v.
2. **Arithmetic error**. The algorithm may perform an arithmetic operation incorrectly. For example, the algorithm may divide two integers by zero, or the algorithm may use the wrong order of operations.
3. **Index out of bounds error**. The algorithm may try to access an element of an array that does not exist. For example, the algorithm may try to access the element at index n + 1, where n is the size of the array.
4. **Null pointer exception**. The algorithm may try to access a null pointer. For example, the algorithm may try to dereference a pointer that has not been initialized.
5. **Stack overflow**. The algorithm may use too much stack space. For example, the algorithm may recursively call itself too many times.

Title:
AIZU p01053 Lucky Number

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly followed. For example, the input may not have the correct number of elements, or the elements may not be of the correct type.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The developer may make a mistake in the calculation, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the developer may forget to carry a number, or may use the wrong formula.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may accidentally add or subtract one from a number, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the developer may count the number of elements in a list incorrectly.
4. **Index out of bounds error**. The developer may try to access an element of an array or list that is out of bounds, resulting in an error. For example, the developer may try to access the 10th element of a list that only has 9 elements.
5. **Null pointer exception**. The developer may try to access a null pointer, resulting in an error. For example, the developer may try to call a method on a variable that has not been initialized.
6. **Memory leak**. The developer may create a memory leak, which can eventually lead to the program running out of memory. For example, the developer may create a new object but not delete it when it is no longer needed.
7. **Race condition**. The developer may create a race condition, which can lead to unpredictable behavior. For example, the developer may try to access a shared resource from two different threads at the same time.
8. **Deadlock**. The developer may create a deadlock, which can prevent the program from making any progress. For example, the developer may have two threads that are each waiting for the other thread to release a lock.
9. **Stack overflow**. The developer may cause a stack overflow, which can eventually crash the program. For example, the developer may create a recursive function that calls itself too many times.

Title:
AIZU p01322 Lottery Checker

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input format is not very clear. It is not clear how to distinguish between the number of winning numbers, the number of lottery tickets in possession, and the winning numbers and winnings.
* The input format is not very consistent. In the first example, the winning numbers are all 8 digits long, but in the second example, they are not.
* The output format is not very clear. It is not clear what the total amount of winnings is.
* The program does not handle invalid input gracefully. For example, if the number of winning numbers is not a positive integer, the program will crash.
* The program does not handle the case where there are no winning numbers.
* The program does not handle the case where there are no lottery tickets in possession.
* The program does not handle the case where the winning numbers and the lottery tickets do not match.

Here are some possible solutions to these problems:

* The input format can be improved by using a more consistent format. For example, the number of winning numbers, the number of lottery tickets in possession, and the winning numbers and winnings can all be specified on the same line.
* The output format can be improved by making it more clear what the total amount of winnings is. For example, the total amount of winnings can be printed on a separate line.
* The program can be made more robust by handling invalid input gracefully. For example, if the number of winning numbers is not a positive integer, the program can print an error message and exit.
* The program can be made more comprehensive by handling the case where there are no winning numbers. For example, the program can print a message indicating that there are no winning numbers.
* The program can be made more user-friendly by handling the case where there are no lottery tickets in possession. For example, the program can print a message indicating that there are no lottery tickets in possession.
* The program can be made more efficient by handling the case where the winning numbers and the lottery tickets do not match. For example, the program can check if the winning numbers and the lottery tickets match before calculating the total amount of winnings.

Title:
AIZU p01490 HullMarathon

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not specified in the problem statement. A developer may incorrectly assume that the input format is a list of integers, when in reality it could be a list of strings, a list of floats, or a list of any other type of data.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the total distance traveled**. The total distance traveled is calculated by adding the distances of each leg of the race. A developer may incorrectly calculate the distance of each leg of the race, or they may incorrectly add the distances of the legs together.
3. **Incorrect rounding of the final answer**. The final answer should be rounded to 3 decimal places. A developer may incorrectly round the final answer to the wrong number of decimal places, or they may not round the final answer at all.
4. **Incorrect error handling**. The problem statement does not specify what should happen if the input is invalid. A developer may incorrectly handle invalid input, which could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
5. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem, such as:
    * Using the wrong data type for a variable
    * Forgetting to initialize a variable
    * Using an incorrect formula to calculate the total distance traveled
    * Misunderstanding the problem statement

# Problem: AIZU p01803 Airport Codes
# https://atcoder.jp/contests/aizu/tasks/aizu_01803

# Solution:
import sys

INF = int(1e9)
MOD = int(1e9 + 7)


def main():
	while True:
		n = int(input())
		if n == 0:

Pain points:

 **1. Mismatch between the input and output format**

The input format is not consistent with the output format. For example, the input format expects 4 integers, but the output format expects 1 integer.

**2. Incorrect boundary checking**

The code does not check for boundary errors. For example, the code does not check if the bomber's coordinates are within the bounds of the grid.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The code does not correctly calculate the number of cells that were damaged by the bomber at least K times. For example, the code does not take into account the fact that the bomber can drop bombs on the same cell multiple times.

**4. Inefficient algorithm**

The code uses an inefficient algorithm to calculate the number of cells that were damaged by the bomber at least K times. For example, the code iterates over all of the cells in the grid, even if they are not affected by the bomber.

**5. Unclear code**

The code is not well-commented and is difficult to understand. For example, the code does not explain what the different variables represent.

Title:
AIZU p02219 Wizard Tower

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The problem states that the input is a list of integers, but the code below is using a list of strings. This will cause errors when trying to perform mathematical operations on the list.
2. **Incorrect variable initialization**. The problem states that the initial MP is 4, but the code below initializes it to 0. This will cause the program to crash when trying to cast the first spell.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code below is trying to cast all of the spells in order, but the problem states that you can cast spells in any order. This will cause the program to miss some of the spells.
4. **Incorrect output**. The code below is printing the total time it takes to cast all of the spells, but the problem states that you need to print the minimum amount of time. This will cause the program to give an incorrect answer.

To fix these problems, you can do the following:

1. Change the variable type of the input list to a list of integers.
2. Initialize the MP variable to 4.
3. Change the logic of the code so that it allows you to cast spells in any order.
4. Change the output of the code to print the minimum amount of time.

Here is the corrected code:

```
N, M, K = map(int, input().split())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Initialize the MP variable.

MP = M

# Cast all of the spells in any order.

for i in range(N):
    # If the current MP is less than the cost of the spell, rest.

    if MP < A[i]:
        # Time elapses.

        MP += M - MP
        # Recover 1 MP.

        MP += 1

    # Cast the spell.

    MP -= A[i]

# Print the minimum amount of time.

print(MP)

Title:
AIZU p02371 Diameter of a Tree

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data structure**

The input data is a tree, so we need to use a tree data structure to represent it. A common mistake is to use an array or a linked list to represent the tree. This will lead to incorrect results because these data structures do not support the operations needed to find the diameter of a tree.

**2. Not initializing the data structure correctly**

Another common mistake is to not initialize the data structure correctly. This can lead to errors such as segmentation faults or incorrect results. It is important to make sure that the data structure is initialized before using it.

**3. Using the wrong algorithm**

There are many different algorithms for finding the diameter of a tree. The most common algorithm is the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. This algorithm is efficient, but it can be difficult to implement correctly. A simpler algorithm is the Borůvka algorithm. This algorithm is not as efficient as the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, but it is much easier to implement.

**4. Making a mistake in the implementation**

Even if you use the right data structure and the right algorithm, you can still make mistakes in the implementation. It is important to carefully read the algorithm and make sure that you understand it before you start implementing it. It is also important to test your implementation thoroughly to make sure that it is correct.

**5. Not handling special cases correctly**

There are a few special cases that you need to handle correctly when finding the diameter of a tree. For example, if the tree is empty, the diameter is 0. If the tree has only one node, the diameter is 0. If the tree has two nodes, the diameter is the weight of the edge between the two nodes.
