Title:
CODECHEF chefhome

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is a list of lists. However, the code is expecting a list of integers. This can be fixed by using the `list()` function to convert the input data to a list of integers.
2. **Incorrect index**. The code is using the `i` variable to index into the list of restaurants. However, the index should start at `0` instead of `1`. This can be fixed by changing the `i` variable to `i - 1`.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The code is calculating the distance between two points using the formula `|A-C| + |B-D|`. However, this formula is incorrect. The correct formula is `sqrt((A-C)^2 + (B-D)^2)`. This can be fixed by changing the formula to `math.sqrt((x1-x2)**2 + (y1-y2)**2)`.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The code is checking if the distance between two points is less than or equal to `1`. However, this logic is incorrect. The correct logic is to check if the distance between two points is equal to `1`. This can be fixed by changing the `<=` operator to `==`.
5. **Incorrect output**. The code is printing the number of possible locations where houses can be built. However, the output should be the list of possible locations. This can be fixed by changing the `print()` statement to `return()`.

Title:
CODECHEF dischar

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of data structures**. For example, using a hash table to store the frequencies of each character in the input string would be incorrect, as this would not allow us to track the order of the characters in the subsequence.
2. **Incorrect use of algorithms**. For example, using a brute-force algorithm to find the largest subsequence of distinct characters would be inefficient, as there are more efficient algorithms available.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. For example, not handling the case where the input string is empty or contains only one character.
4. **Incorrect error handling**. Not handling errors that may occur during the execution of the program, such as a divide-by-zero error.
5. **Incorrect output formatting**. Not formatting the output of the program correctly, such as not using the correct number of spaces between the output values.

1. Increase all the integers by 1: [0, -1, -2] => [1, -2, -3]
2. Increase -2 by 1: [1, -2, -3] => [1, -1, -2]
3. Increase -1 by 1: [1, -1, -2] => [2, 0, -2]
 **1. Using the wrong data type for the input/output**

The input and output of this problem are integers. A common mistake is to use the wrong data type, such as strings or floats. This can lead to incorrect results.

**2. Not handling negative numbers correctly**

The input array can contain negative numbers. A common mistake is to forget to handle negative numbers correctly. This can lead to incorrect results.

**3. Not considering the cost of each operation**

The cost of each operation must be taken into account when calculating the minimum cost. A common mistake is to ignore the cost of operations, which can lead to incorrect results.

**4. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

There are several different ways to solve this problem. A common mistake is to use an inefficient algorithm, which can lead to slow runtimes.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code to ensure that it is correct. A common mistake is to not test your code, which can lead to incorrect results.

Title:
CODECHEF nicequad

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for storing the coordinates of the points.** This can lead to incorrect results, as the calculations will be performed on the wrong values. For example, if the coordinates of a point are stored as floats, but the calculations are performed using integers, the results will be incorrect.
2. **Not taking into account the orientation of the quadrangle.** A quadrangle is only considered nice if it has a positive area. This means that the order of the points in the quadrangle is important. For example, the quadrangle formed by the points (1, 1), (2, 2), (-1, -1), and (-2, 2) is not nice, because it has a negative area.
3. **Not considering the possibility that two or more of the points may be collinear.** If two or more of the points are collinear, then it is not possible to form a quadrangle from them.
4. **Not considering the possibility that the points may not be distinct.** If two or more of the points are the same, then it is not possible to form a quadrangle from them.
5. **Not handling errors correctly.** If there is an error in the input data, the program should handle the error gracefully and output an appropriate error message.
6. **Not using efficient algorithms.** The algorithms used to solve the problem should be as efficient as possible. This will help to reduce the running time of the program.
7. **Not testing the program thoroughly.** The program should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and produces the correct results. This can be done by creating test cases with different inputs and checking that the program produces the correct outputs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1091_A. New Year and the Christmas Ornament

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The input is a list of integers, but the code tries to convert it to a string. This will cause a ValueError.
2. **Incorrect comparison:** The code compares the number of yellow ornaments to the number of blue ornaments, but it should be comparing the number of blue ornaments to the number of red ornaments. This will cause an incorrect answer.
3. **Off-by-one error:** The code adds 1 to the number of blue ornaments to get the number of red ornaments, but it should be adding 2. This will cause an incorrect answer.
4. **Infinite loop:** The code enters an infinite loop if the number of yellow ornaments is equal to the number of blue ornaments. This is because the code never decreases the number of yellow ornaments.
5. **Memory leak:** The code does not free the memory allocated for the input list. This can cause a memory leak.
6. **Security vulnerability:** The code does not validate the input. This could allow a malicious user to input invalid data, which could lead to a security vulnerability.

To avoid these problems, you should:

1. Use the correct variable type for the input.
2. Use the correct comparison operator.
3. Check for off-by-one errors.
4. Avoid infinite loops.
5. Free the memory allocated for the input list.
6. Validate the input.

CODEFORCES 110_D. Lucky Probability

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is five integers, but the developer may accidentally read in a different number of values. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the probability.** The probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. The developer may make a mistake in either of these calculations, leading to an incorrect answer.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When working with ranges of numbers, it is easy to make a mistake and forget to include the endpoints in the calculation. This can lead to the developer underestimating or overestimating the probability of an event.
4. **Floating-point errors.** When working with floating-point numbers, it is important to be aware of the limitations of these types. For example, the number 0.1 cannot be represented exactly as a floating-point number, and this can lead to rounding errors when performing calculations.
5. **Memory errors.** If the developer does not allocate enough memory for the program to run, it may crash or produce incorrect results. It is important to be aware of the memory requirements of your program and to allocate enough memory to avoid these problems.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and to carefully design and implement your solution. It is also helpful to test your program thoroughly with a variety of input values.

CODEFORCES 113_A. Grammar Lessons

Pain points:
1. The input may contain words that do not belong to the Petya's language. For example, "abc" is not a valid word in the Petya's language.
2. The input may contain multiple sentences. For example, "nataliala kataliala vetra feinites nataliala kataliala vetra feinites" contains two sentences.
3. The input may contain words with incorrect genders. For example, "nataliala kataliala vetra feinitis" is not a valid sentence because "nataliala" is a feminine adjective and "vetra" is a masculine noun.
4. The input may contain words with incorrect endings. For example, "nataliala kataliala vetra finitis" is not a valid sentence because "finitis" is not a valid ending for a verb.
5. The input may contain words that are not in the correct order. For example, "nataliala kataliala vetra feinitis" is not a valid sentence because the adjectives should come before the noun.
6. The input may contain words that are not separated by spaces. For example, "natalialakatilialaverafeinites" is not a valid sentence because the words are not separated by spaces.

To avoid these problems, the developer should:

1. Validate the input to ensure that it contains only valid words in the Petya's language.
2. Check that the input contains only one sentence.
3. Check that the words in the sentence have the correct genders.
4. Check that the words in the sentence have the correct endings.

Title:
CODEFORCES 117_D. Not Quick Transformation

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data in this problem is quite large. So it's very important to use the right data type to store the input data. In this problem, the input data is an array of integers. So we should use `int` or `long long` to store the input data. Using `short` or `int` may cause overflow.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the sum of numbers in a range. A naive solution is to iterate over all the numbers in the range and add them up. However, this solution has a time complexity of O(n). We can do better by using a divide and conquer algorithm. The following is a divide and conquer algorithm to find the sum of numbers in a range:

```
def find_sum(l, r):
    if l == r:
        return a[l]
    mid = (l + r) // 2
    return find_sum(l, mid) + find_sum(mid + 1, r)
```

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n).

**3. Using the wrong boundary conditions**

When writing code, it's very important to check the boundary conditions. In this problem, the input data is an array of integers. So we should check if the input data is valid. For example, we should check if the input data is a valid array. We should also check if the input data is in the correct range.

**4. Using the wrong variable names**

When writing code, it's very important to use meaningful variable names. In this problem, the input data is an array of integers. So we should use a variable name that reflects the fact that the variable stores an array of integers. For example, we should use `a` to store the input data.

**5. Using the wrong indentation**

When writing code, it's very important to use the right indentation. The indentation should be consistent throughout the code. This will make the code easier to read and understand.

**6. Using the wrong comments**

When writing code, it's very important to use comments to explain the code. This will make the code easier to read and understand. The comments should be concise and informative.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1198_E. Rectangle Painting 2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem requires us to find the minimum total cost of painting the whole square in white. To do this, we need to keep track of the cost of painting each rectangle and the total cost of painting all rectangles. One common mistake is to use a list to store the cost of painting each rectangle. This is incorrect because a list is not a suitable data structure for this problem. A list is a linear data structure, which means that it can only store data in a sequential order. This means that we would not be able to efficiently find the minimum cost of painting each rectangle.
2. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** The problem requires us to find the minimum total cost of painting the whole square in white. To do this, we can use a greedy algorithm. A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that makes the best possible decision at each step, without considering the future consequences. In this case, we can use a greedy algorithm to find the minimum cost of painting each rectangle. We can do this by starting with the rectangle with the smallest cost and then iteratively adding the rectangle with the smallest cost that does not overlap with any of the rectangles that we have already added.
3. **Incorrect implementation.** The implementation of the solution is another common source of bugs. One common mistake is to forget to initialize the data structures that are used in the solution. Another common mistake is to make a mistake in the logic of the algorithm.
4. **Incorrect test cases.** The test cases are an important part of any programming project. They help to ensure that the solution is correct and that it works as expected. One common mistake is to forget to test the solution on all possible input values. Another common mistake is to test the solution on input values that are not representative of the real-world problem.
5. **Incorrect debugging.** Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in a program. One common mistake is to not use a debugger. A debugger is a tool that helps you to find and fix errors in a program. Another common mistake is to not use the right debugging techniques.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements. It is also important to use the correct data structures and algorithms. Finally, it is important to write unit tests and to use a debugger to find and fix errors.

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain an even integer n, and the second line should contain a string of n digits and "?" characters. However, if the input format is not followed, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to determine the winner may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not take into account all of the possible ways to replace the erased digits, or it may not correctly determine whether the ticket is happy after all of the erased digits are replaced.
3. **Incorrect data handling**. The program may not correctly handle invalid data, such as negative numbers or non-numeric characters.
4. **Incorrect error handling**. The program may not correctly handle errors, such as invalid input or out-of-memory errors.
5. **Incorrect output format**. The program may not output the correct answer in the correct format.

CODEFORCES 1238_F. The Maximum Subtree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The tree traversal algorithm should visit all nodes in the tree in a specific order, such as preorder, postorder, or inorder. If the algorithm is not implemented correctly, it may miss some nodes or visit them in the wrong order, which will result in incorrect results.
2. Using an incorrect data structure to represent the tree. The tree can be represented in a variety of ways, such as an adjacency list, an adjacency matrix, or a binary tree. The choice of data structure can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. It is important to choose a data structure that is well-suited for the problem being solved.
3. Using an incorrect algorithm to find the maximum subtree. There are a variety of algorithms that can be used to find the maximum subtree in a tree. The choice of algorithm can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. It is important to choose an algorithm that is well-suited for the problem being solved.
4. Incorrect implementation of the maximum subtree algorithm. This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The maximum subtree algorithm should find the subtree with the largest number of nodes. If the algorithm is not implemented correctly, it may find a subtree with a smaller number of nodes, which will result in incorrect results.
5. Using incorrect input data. The input data for the problem should be carefully checked to ensure that it is valid. If the input data is incorrect, it may cause the algorithm to crash or produce incorrect results.
6. Not handling all possible cases. The algorithm should be able to handle all possible cases that may occur, such as a tree with no edges, a tree with a single node, or a tree with a cycle. If the algorithm is not able to handle all possible cases, it may crash or produce incorrect results.
7. Not using enough memory. The algorithm may require a significant amount of memory to store the tree and its traversal. If the algorithm does not have enough memory, it may crash or produce incorrect results.
8. Not running the algorithm in a timely manner. The algorithm may take a long time to run, especially for large trees. If the algorithm does not run in a timely manner, it may not be able to finish before the time limit is reached.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design and implement the algorithm, and to carefully check the input data. It is also important to use a data structure that is well-suited for the problem being solved, and to choose an algorithm that is efficient and well-suited for the problem being solved.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1257_A. Two Rival Students

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly followed, which may cause the program to crash or output incorrect results. For example, if the input format is "1 2 3 4", the program will crash because it cannot parse the input as four integers.
2. **Incorrect variable type**. The variable type is not correctly specified, which may cause the program to crash or output incorrect results. For example, if the variable `n` is declared as an integer but the input is a string, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program is incorrect, which may cause the program to output incorrect results. For example, if the program is supposed to find the maximum distance between two rival students, but it instead finds the minimum distance, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can cause the program to output incorrect results. For example, if the program is supposed to find the maximum distance between two rival students, but it instead finds the distance between the first student and the second student minus one, the output will be incorrect.
5. **Indexing errors**. Indexing errors occur when the programmer accesses an element of an array or list using an incorrect index. This can cause the program to crash or output incorrect results. For example, if the program is supposed to access the third element of an array, but it instead accesses the fourth element, the output will be incorrect.
6. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when the programmer allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
7. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to output incorrect results or crash.
8. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can cause the program to run indefinitely or crash.
9. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities occur when the programmer does not properly protect the program from malicious attacks. This can allow attackers to gain access to the program's data or control the program's execution.
10. **Performance issues**. Performance issues occur when the program runs slowly or uses too much memory. This can make the program unusable or cause it to crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1406_E. Deleting Numbers

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for x**

The input specifies that `x` is an integer in the range `[1, n]`. However, if you accidentally use a data type that is too small to store `x`, you may get unexpected results. For example, if you use a `char` to store `x`, you may only be able to store values up to `255`, which is not enough for all possible values of `x`.

**2. Using the wrong data type for the set of numbers**

The input specifies that the set of numbers is `[1, 2, ..., n]`. However, if you accidentally use a data type that is too small to store all of the numbers in the set, you may get unexpected results. For example, if you use a `short` to store the numbers, you may only be able to store values up to `32767`, which is not enough for all possible values of `n`.

**3. Not handling the case where `x` is not in the set of numbers**

The input specifies that `x` is a member of the set of numbers. However, if you accidentally assume that `x` is always in the set, you may get unexpected results. For example, if `x` is not in the set, you may try to delete it, which will cause an error.

**4. Not handling the case where `x` is equal to 1**

The input specifies that `x` is an integer greater than 1. However, if you accidentally allow `x` to be equal to 1, you may get unexpected results. For example, if `x` is equal to 1, you may try to delete it, which will cause an error.

**5. Not handling the case where `n` is small**

The input specifies that `n` is an integer in the range `[1, 10^5]`. However, if you accidentally allow `n` to be very small, you may get unexpected results. For example, if `n` is equal to 1, you may not be able to perform any operations on the set of numbers.

**6. Not handling the case where `n` is large**

The input specifies that `n` is an integer in the range `[1, 10^5]`. However, if you accidentally allow `n` to be very large, you may get unexpected results. For example, if `n` is equal to 10^5, you may not be able to store all of the numbers in the set of numbers in memory.

**7. Not handling the case where the set of numbers is empty**

The input specifies that the set of numbers is `[1, 2, ..., n]`. However, if `n` is equal to 0, the set of numbers will be empty. In this case, you will not be able to perform any operations on the set of numbers.

**8. Not handling the case where the set of numbers is a singleton**

The input specifies that the set of numbers is `[1, 2, ..., n]`. However, if `n` is equal to 1, the set of numbers will be a singleton. In this case, you will not be able to perform any operations on the set of numbers except for `C 1`.
Test inputs:
### 1. Using the wrong data type for x

```
n = int(input())
x = int(input())
```

This code uses the `int` data type to store both `n` and `x`. This is fine for `n`, but it is not safe for `x` because `x` can be greater than `2^31 - 1`. To avoid this problem, we can use the `long` data type to store `x`.

```
n = int(input())
x = int(input())
```

### 2. Using the wrong data type for the set of numbers

```
n = int(input())
nums = list(range(1, n + 1))
```

This code uses the `list` data type to store the set of numbers. This is fine for small values of `n`, but it is not safe for large values of `n` because the `list` data type has a maximum size of `2^31 - 1` elements. To avoid this problem, we can use the `set` data type to store the set of numbers.

```
n = int(input())
nums = set(range(1, n + 1))
```

### 3. Not handling the case where x is not in the set of numbers

```
n = int(input())
x = int(input())
nums = list(range(1, n + 1))
if x not in nums:
    print("Error: x is not in the set of numbers")
    exit(1)
```

This code checks to make sure that `x` is in the set of numbers before performing any operations on it. If `x` is not in the set of numbers, the code prints an error message and exits.

### 4. Not handling the case where x is equal to 1

```
n = int(input())
x = int(input())
nums = list(range(1, n + 1))
if x == 1:
    print("Error: x cannot be equal to 1")
    exit(1)
```

This code checks to make sure that `x` is not equal to 1 before performing any operations on it. If `x` is equal to 1, the code prints an error message and exits.

### 5. Not handling the case where n is small

```
n = int(input())
nums = list(range(1, n + 1))
if n < 1:
    print("Error: n must be at least 1")
    exit(1)
```

This code checks to make sure that `n` is at least 1 before performing any operations on it. If `n` is less than 1, the code prints an error message and exits.

### 6. Not handling the case where n is large

```
n = int(input())
nums = list(range(1, n + 1))
if n > 10**5:
    print("Error: n must be at most 10^5")
    exit(1)
```

This code checks to make sure that `n` is at most 10^5 before performing any operations on it. If `n` is greater than 10^5, the code prints an error message and exits.

### 7. Not handling the case where the set of numbers is empty

```
n = int(input())
nums = list(range(1, n + 1))
if len(nums) == 0:
    print("Error: the set of numbers is empty")
    exit(1)
```

This code checks to make sure that the set of numbers is not empty before performing any operations on it. If the set of numbers is empty, the code prints an error message and exits.

### 8. Not handling the case where the set of numbers is a singleton

```
n = int(input())
nums = list(range(1, n + 1))
if len(nums) == 1:
    print("Error: the set of numbers is a singleton")
    exit(1)
```

This code checks to make sure that the set of numbers is not a singleton before performing any operations on it. If the set of numbers is a singleton, the code prints an error message and exits.

**Here are some additional program inputs that you can use to test your implementation:**

* `n = 10`
Title:
CODEFORCES 1427_F. Boring Card Game

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is:

```
n
x_1, x_2, ..., x_{3n}
```

where `n` is the number of cards in the deck, and `x_1, x_2, ..., x_{3n}` are the cards in Federico's pocket at the end of the game.

If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to parse the input and will produce an error.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is:

```
a_1, b_1, c_1
a_2, b_2, c_2
...
a_{2n-1}, b_{2n-1}, c_{2n-1}
```

where `a_i`, `b_i`, and `c_i` are the three cards taken by the player during the `i`th turn.

If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will produce an error.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic of the program should be correct in order to produce the correct output.

For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
def main():
    n = int(input())
    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(2 * n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            # This code is incorrect because it does not take three contiguous cards from the deck.
            cards.remove(cards[0])
            cards.remove(cards[1])
            cards.remove(cards[2])
        else:
            # This code is incorrect because it does not print the three cards in increasing order.
            print(cards[0], cards[1], cards[2])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This code will not produce the correct output because it does not take three contiguous cards from the deck and it does not print the three cards in increasing order.

**4. Incorrect data**

The data for this problem should be correct in order to produce the correct output.

For example, the following data is incorrect:

```
n = 3
cards = [1, 2, 3]
```

This data is incorrect because it does not have 3n cards, where n is the number of cards in the deck.

**5. Incorrect assumptions**

The program should not make any incorrect assumptions about the input data.

For example, the following code is incorrect because it assumes that the input data is always correct:

```
def main():
    n = int(input())
    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(2 * n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            # This code is incorrect because it assumes that the input data is always correct.
            cards.remove(cards[0])
            cards.remove(cards[1])
            cards.remove(cards[2])
        else:
            # This code is incorrect because it assumes that the input data is always correct.
            print(cards[0], cards[1], cards[2])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This code will not work if the input data is incorrect.

```

3. **Incorrect logic**

```
n = int(input())
cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
for i in range(2 * n):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        # This code is incorrect because it does not take three contiguous cards from the deck.
        cards.remove(cards[0])
        cards.remove(cards[1])
        cards.remove(cards[2])
    else:

CODEFORCES 294_C. Shaass and Lights

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains two integers n and m, where n is the number of lights in the sequence and m is the number of lights which are initially switched on. If we use the wrong data type to store n and m, it may cause overflow and lead to incorrect results. For example, if we use int to store n and m, and n = 1000 and m = 1000, then n * m will overflow.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The key idea is to use a 2D array dp[i][j] to store the number of ways to switch all the lights on, where i is the number of lights that are initially switched on and j is the number of lights that have been switched on. We can then use the following recurrence relation to fill the dp array:

```
dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]
```

where dp[i - 1][j] is the number of ways to switch all the lights on if the first i - 1 lights are initially switched on, and dp[i - 1][j - 1] is the number of ways to switch all the lights on if the first i - 1 lights are initially switched off.

However, if we use the wrong algorithm, it may lead to incorrect results. For example, the following algorithm is incorrect:

```
for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
  for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
    if (i == 0) {
      dp[i][j] = 1;
    } else if (j == 0) {
      dp[i][j] = 0;
    } else {
      dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1];
    }
  }
}
```

This algorithm is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that a light can only be switched on if there is at least one adjacent light which is already switched on.

**3. Using the wrong modulo operator**

The output of the problem should be a number modulo 1000000007. If we use the wrong modulo operator, it may lead to incorrect results. For example, if we use % instead of % 1000000007, then the output may be incorrect.

**4. Not handling overflow correctly**

The problem may involve large numbers. If we do not handle overflow correctly, it may lead to incorrect results. For example, if we use the following code to calculate the product of two integers, it may overflow:

```
int product = a * b;
```

Instead, we should use the following code to calculate the product of two integers:

```
long long product = a * b;
product %= 1000000007;
```

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the input should be two integers, n and k, separated by a space. However, the input may contain other characters, such as a newline character, which will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the output should be a single integer. However, the output may contain other characters, such as a newline character, which will cause the program to crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. The program may incorrectly calculate the position of the number in the sequence, resulting in an incorrect output. This can happen if the program does not correctly account for the fact that the first half of the sequence contains all odd numbers and the second half contains all even numbers.
4. **Arithmetic errors**. The program may incorrectly perform arithmetic operations, such as addition or subtraction, resulting in an incorrect output. This can happen if the program does not correctly handle overflow or underflow.
5. **Memory errors**. The program may run out of memory if it is not careful about how it allocates and frees memory. This can happen if the program does not correctly track the amount of memory it is using.
6. **Synchronization errors**. The program may not be thread-safe, which can lead to incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time. This can happen if the program does not use locks or other synchronization mechanisms to protect shared data.
7. **Deadlocks**. The program may deadlock if two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can happen if the program does not use locks or other synchronization mechanisms correctly.
8. **Race conditions**. The program may experience a race condition if two or more threads are trying to access the same data at the same time and the outcome of the program depends on the order in which the threads access the data. This can happen if the program does not use locks or other synchronization mechanisms correctly.
9. **Buffer overflows**. The program may overflow a buffer if it does not correctly check the size of the buffer before writing data to it. This can happen if the program does not use the correct size specifiers when declaring buffers or if the program does not check the return value of functions that read data from buffers.
10. **Format string vulnerabilities**. The program may be vulnerable to format string vulnerabilities if it uses the printf() or scanf() functions incorrectly. This can happen if the program does not properly escape special characters in format strings or if the program does not provide enough arguments to the printf() or scanf() functions.

CODEFORCES 342_A. Xenia and Divisors

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be `n`, followed by a list of `n` integers. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will output an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect logic**. The logic for splitting the sequence into groups of three should ensure that each group satisfies the conditions `a < b < c` and `a divides b, b divides c`. If the logic is incorrect, the program will not be able to find a valid partition of the sequence and will output an incorrect answer.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When splitting the sequence into groups of three, it is important to make sure that the groups are correctly aligned. If there is an off-by-one error, the program will not be able to find a valid partition of the sequence and will output an incorrect answer.
4. **Memory errors**. If the program does not properly manage its memory, it may run out of memory and crash. This can happen if the program tries to allocate too much memory or if it does not free up memory that is no longer needed.
5. **Timeout errors**. If the program takes too long to run, it may be terminated by the judge. This can happen if the program is inefficient or if it gets stuck in an infinite loop.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully review the input format, logic, and implementation of your program. You should also test your program on a variety of input cases to make sure that it is working correctly.
Test inputs:

Title:
CODEFORCES 529_E. The Art of Dealing with ATM

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly, and that you are not making any mistakes when parsing the input data. For example, if you accidentally read the number of bills as a string instead of an integer, your program will not work correctly.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also very specific. It is important to make sure that you are printing the output in the correct format, and that you are not making any mistakes when formatting the output data. For example, if you accidentally print the number of bills as a string instead of an integer, your program will not produce the correct output.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm that you use to solve this problem is very important. If you use an incorrect algorithm, your program will not be able to solve the problem correctly. For example, if you use an algorithm that does not take into account the fact that the ATM can only give out at most k bills, your program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.

**4. Runtime errors**

Your program should be able to run to completion in a reasonable amount of time. If your program takes too long to run, it will not be able to solve the problem correctly. For example, if your program uses a recursive algorithm to solve the problem, it will likely take too long to run for large input values.

**5. Memory errors**

Your program should not use too much memory. If your program uses too much memory, it will not be able to solve the problem correctly. For example, if your program stores all of the input data in memory, it will likely use too much memory for large input values.

CODEFORCES 555_B. Case of Fugitive

Pain points:
**1. Input Format**

The first line contains integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105) — the number of islands and bridges.

Next n lines each contain two integers li and ri (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 1018) — the coordinates of the island endpoints.

The last line contains m integer numbers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ 1018) — the lengths of the bridges that Andrewid got.

**2. Output Format**

If it is impossible to place a bridge between each pair of adjacent islands in the required manner, print on a single line "No" (without the quotes), otherwise print in the first line "Yes" (without the quotes), and in the second line print n - 1 numbers b1, b2, ..., bn - 1, which mean that between islands i and i + 1 there must be used a bridge number bi. 

If there are multiple correct answers, print any of them. Note that in this problem it is necessary to print "Yes" and "No" in correct case.

**3. Possible Problems**

1. The input format is not correct. For example, the input may contain a number that is too large or too small.
2. The output format is not correct. For example, the output may not contain the correct number of lines or the output may not be in the correct format.
3. The code may not be able to handle all of the test cases. For example, the code may crash or produce incorrect output for some of the test cases.
4. The code may be inefficient. For example, the code may take too long to run or use too much memory.
5. The code may be difficult to understand or maintain. For example, the code may be poorly written or use complex algorithms.

**4. Possible Bugs**

1. The code may contain logical errors. For example, the code may not correctly check for all of the possible cases.
2. The code may contain syntax errors. For example, the code may not be properly formatted or may contain incorrect statements.
3. The code may contain runtime errors. For example, the code may crash or produce incorrect output.

**5. How to Avoid These Problems**

1. Carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand what is being asked.
2. Test your code on a variety of test cases, including both small and large cases.
3. Use a debugger to help you find and fix errors in your code.
4. Write your code in a clear and concise manner so that it is easy to understand and maintain.
5. Use an efficient algorithm to solve the problem.

**6. Tips for Solving This Problem**

1. The key to solving this problem is to first understand the input format and output format.
2. Once you understand the input format and output format, you can start to think about how to solve the problem.
3. One possible solution is to use a greedy algorithm.
4. A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that makes the best possible decision at each step, without considering the future.
5. In this case, the greedy algorithm would choose the bridge with the shortest length that can be used to connect two adjacent islands.
6. The greedy algorithm would continue to choose the shortest bridge that can be used to connect two adjacent islands until all of the islands are connected.
7. If the greedy algorithm is able to connect all of the islands, then the output should be "Yes".
8. If the greedy algorithm is not able to connect all of the islands, then the output should be "No".

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be two positive integers separated by a space. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of days when Vasya can wear different socks**. The maximum number of days when Vasya can wear different socks is the minimum of the number of red socks and the number of blue socks. If the number of red socks is less than the number of blue socks, then the maximum number of days when Vasya can wear different socks is the number of red socks. Otherwise, the maximum number of days when Vasya can wear different socks is the number of blue socks.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of days when Vasya can wear the same socks until he either runs out of socks or cannot make a single pair from the socks he's got**. The number of days when Vasya can wear the same socks until he either runs out of socks or cannot make a single pair from the socks he's got is the minimum of the number of red socks and the number of blue socks minus 1. If the number of red socks is less than the number of blue socks, then the number of days when Vasya can wear the same socks until he either runs out of socks or cannot make a single pair from the socks he's got is the number of red socks minus 1. Otherwise, the number of days when Vasya can wear the same socks until he either runs out of socks or cannot make a single pair from the socks he's got is the number of blue socks minus 1.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be two space-separated integers: the maximum number of days when Vasya can wear different socks and the number of days when Vasya can wear the same socks until he either runs out of socks or cannot make a single pair from the socks he's got. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not produce the correct output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 64_E. Prime Segment

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the `is_prime` function.** The `is_prime` function should only be used to check if a number is prime, not to find the next prime number. To find the next prime number, you can use the following algorithm:

    ```python
    def next_prime(n):
        # Increment `n` until it is prime.
        while not is_prime(n):
            n += 1

        # Return the prime number.
        return n
    ```

2. **Using an incorrect loop condition.** The loop condition should check if `i` is less than or equal to `n`, not greater than or equal to `n`.

3. **Using an incorrect indexing operator.** The indexing operator should be used to access the elements of a list, not to increment the index.

4. **Using an incorrect comparison operator.** The comparison operator should be used to compare two values, not to assign a value to a variable.

5. **Using an incorrect variable type.** The variable type should be appropriate for the data that it stores. For example, you should use an integer variable to store an integer value, and a float variable to store a floating-point value.

6. **Using an incorrect function.** The function should be appropriate for the task that it is being used for. For example, you should use the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers, and the `len` function to get the length of a sequence.

Title:
CODEFORCES 698_F. Coprime Permutation

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**.

The modulo operator (%) is used to find the remainder of a division. For example, 10 % 3 = 1, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.

In this problem, the output must be modulo 109 + 7. This means that the remainder of the output must be between 0 and 109 + 6.

If you accidentally use the wrong modulo operator, your output may be incorrect. For example, if you use the modulo operator % 1000000009, your output may be incorrect because 109 + 7 is not divisible by 1000000009.

**2. Not considering all possible cases**.

In this problem, we need to consider all possible ways to fill the gaps so that the door will open. For example, if there are 4 gaps to fill, we need to consider all 4! = 24 possible permutations.

If you don't consider all possible cases, your output may be incorrect.

**3. Making a mistake in the calculation**.

When calculating the number of ways to fill the gaps, it is easy to make a mistake. For example, you might forget to multiply by the factorial of the number of gaps.

If you make a mistake in the calculation, your output may be incorrect.

**4. Using an incorrect algorithm**.

There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others.

If you use an incorrect algorithm, your solution may be slow and/or use a lot of memory.

**5. Not testing your code**.

It is important to test your code before submitting it to the judge. This will help you to catch any bugs in your code.

If you don't test your code, you may submit a solution that is incorrect or that does not run on the judge.

5. **Memory errors.** The program may run out of memory if the input is too large. This can lead to the program crashing.
6. **Timeout errors.** The program may not finish running in time if the input is too large. This can lead to the program being marked as a time limit exceeded.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format and data types, and to use appropriate error handling techniques. It is also important to use efficient algorithms and data structures to minimize the risk of arithmetic errors and memory errors. Finally, it is important to test the program with a variety of inputs to ensure that it is robust and does not crash or produce incorrect output.

CODEFORCES 740_D. Alyona and a tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type.** The input data is a tree, but the code may treat it as a graph. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the DFS algorithm.** The DFS algorithm is used to find the subtree of a vertex. If the implementation is incorrect, the subtree may not be found correctly, which will lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the distance between two vertices.** The distance between two vertices is the sum of the weights of the edges on the path between them. If the calculation is incorrect, the controlled vertices may not be found correctly, which will lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect output.** The output should be a list of integers, each of which represents the number of vertices that the corresponding vertex controls. If the output is incorrect, the problem will not be solved correctly.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. The code should be carefully written and tested to ensure that it is correct.

CODEFORCES 764_C. Timofey and a tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the DFS algorithm.** The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that visits all vertices of a graph in a depth-first order. It is often used to find a path between two vertices in a graph, or to find all connected components of a graph. In this problem, we can use DFS to find all vertices that are connected to the root vertex. If there are no vertices that are connected to the root vertex, then Timofey can remove the tree without being annoyed.
2. **Incorrect use of the Union-Find data structure.** The Union-Find data structure is a data structure that can be used to find the connected components of a graph. In this problem, we can use Union-Find to find all vertices that are connected to the root vertex. If there are no vertices that are connected to the root vertex, then Timofey can remove the tree without being annoyed.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The input to this problem may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers that are too large. It is important to handle these edge cases correctly in order to avoid errors.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The output of this problem must be in the correct format. For example, the output must be a single line that says "YES" or "NO". If the output is not in the correct format, the judge will give the submission a zero score.
5. **Incorrect runtime.** The runtime of the solution must be within the time limit specified by the problem. If the solution does not run within the time limit, the judge will give the submission a zero score.

CODEFORCES 854_C. Planning

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by commas. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect variable names**. The variable names should be descriptive and easy to understand. Using cryptic or meaningless variable names can make the code difficult to read and debug.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program should be correct. This means that the program should produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to the program producing incorrect output.
5. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program producing incorrect output or crashing.
7. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can lead to the program running indefinitely or crashing.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can occur when a program does not properly protect its data. This can allow attackers to gain access to sensitive data or take control of the program.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design and test your code. You should also use a debugger to help you find and fix bugs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 879_A. Borya's Diagnosis

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly followed, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect variable type**. The variables used to store the input data may be of the wrong type, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. For example, if the input data is a list of integers, but the variable used to store it is a string, the program may crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic used to solve the problem may be incorrect, which may cause the program to produce incorrect results. For example, if the program assumes that all doctors work on the same day, it will produce incorrect results for inputs where the doctors work on different days.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the program does not account for the fact that the first element of a list or array is at index 0, not index 1. For example, if the program is supposed to find the smallest element in a list, but it starts at index 1 instead of index 0, it will find the second smallest element instead of the smallest element.
5. **Infinite loops**. Infinite loops occur when the program enters a loop that never terminates. For example, if the program is supposed to print all of the elements in a list, but it does not have a condition to stop the loop, it will print the elements of the list infinitely.
6. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when the program allocates memory that it does not free, which can eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash. For example, if the program creates a new object but does not delete it when it is no longer needed, it will create a memory leak.
7. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time, which can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash. For example, if two threads are both trying to update the same variable, the value of the variable may be incorrect when both threads have finished.
8. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, which can cause the program to freeze. For example, if two threads are both trying to lock the same mutex, neither thread will be able to continue until the other thread releases the mutex.

CODEFORCES 924_E. Wardrobe

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correctly parsed. For example, if the input contains a space between two integers, the program may crash. To avoid this, make sure that the input is formatted correctly.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not always correctly parsed. For example, if the output contains a newline character after the last integer, the program may crash. To avoid this, make sure that the output is formatted correctly.

**3. Undefined behavior**

Some compilers may not define the behavior of a program in certain cases. For example, if a program tries to divide by zero, the compiler may not define what the program should do. To avoid this, make sure that your program does not contain any undefined behavior.

**4. Memory leaks**

A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing. To avoid memory leaks, make sure that you free all of the memory that you allocate.

**5. Race conditions**

A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results or crashing. To avoid race conditions, make sure that you synchronize access to shared data.

**6. Deadlocks**

A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can lead to the program being stuck in an infinite loop. To avoid deadlocks, make sure that you release locks as soon as possible.

**7. Stack overflow**

A stack overflow occurs when a program tries to push more data onto the stack than it can hold. This can lead to the program crashing. To avoid stack overflows, make sure that your program does not allocate too much stack space.

**8. Buffer overflow**

A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data into a buffer than it can hold. This can lead to the program crashing or being exploited by an attacker. To avoid buffer overflows, make sure that your program does not write too much data into buffers.

Title:
CODEFORCES 97_D. Robot in Basement

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may be in the wrong order. The developer should check the input format and make sure that it is correct before processing it.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correctly followed. For example, the output may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may be in the wrong order. The developer should check the output format and make sure that it is correct before returning it.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when the developer miscounts by one. For example, the developer may try to access an element in an array that does not exist, or they may try to perform an operation on a variable that has not been initialized. Off-by-one errors can be difficult to find, so it is important to be careful when writing code.
4. **Index out of bounds errors**. Index out of bounds errors occur when the developer tries to access an element in an array that is outside of the bounds of the array. For example, the developer may try to access the first element in an array that has no elements, or they may try to access the last element in an array that has only one element. Index out of bounds errors can be difficult to find, so it is important to be careful when writing code.
5. **Null pointer exceptions**. Null pointer exceptions occur when the developer tries to dereference a null pointer. A null pointer is a pointer that points to nothing, and it is usually created when the developer tries to create a reference to a variable that does not exist. Null pointer exceptions can be difficult to find, so it is important to be careful when writing code.
6. **Arithmetic errors**. Arithmetic errors occur when the developer performs an arithmetic operation incorrectly. For example, the developer may try to divide a number by zero, or they may try to take the square root of a negative number. Arithmetic errors can be difficult to find, so it is important to be careful when writing code.
7. **Logic errors**. Logic errors occur when the developer makes a mistake in the logic of their code. For example, the developer may write a function that does not return the correct value, or they may write a loop that never terminates. Logic errors can be difficult to find, so it is important to be careful when writing code.

HACKEREARTH find-factorial

Pain points:
1. **Using an incorrect formula.** The factorial of a number is the product of all numbers from 1 to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120. However, some developers may mistakenly use the formula n! = n * (n - 1)! to calculate the factorial of a number. This formula is incorrect for numbers greater than 1, as it will always result in a factorial of 0.
2. **Using an incorrect data type.** The factorial of a number can be very large, especially for large numbers. For example, the factorial of 10 is 3628800. If a developer does not use an appropriate data type to store the factorial, they may encounter a **overflow error**, which occurs when a value is too large to be stored in a given data type.
3. **Not handling negative numbers correctly.** The factorial of a negative number does not exist. If a developer attempts to calculate the factorial of a negative number, they will receive an **invalid argument error**.
4. **Not handling zero correctly.** The factorial of 0 is 1. If a developer attempts to calculate the factorial of 0, they will receive a **division by zero error**.
5. **Using an inefficient algorithm.** The factorial of a number can be calculated using a recursive algorithm, which is a type of algorithm that calls itself repeatedly. However, recursive algorithms can be very inefficient, especially for large numbers. A more efficient way to calculate the factorial of a number is to use a **dynamic programming** algorithm. Dynamic programming algorithms store the results of intermediate calculations, which can be reused to avoid having to recalculate them multiple times.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems when solving the factorial problem:

* Use the correct formula to calculate the factorial of a number.
* Use an appropriate data type to store the factorial.
* Handle negative numbers and zero correctly.
* Use an efficient algorithm to calculate the factorial.
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect formula**

```
n = int(input())
print(n * ((n - 1)!))
```

This code will produce the incorrect output for any number greater than 1.

2. **Incorrect data type**

```
n = int(input())
print(n!)
```

This code will produce an overflow error for any number greater than 10.

3. **Not handling negative numbers correctly**

```
n = int(input())
if n < 0:
    print("Invalid argument")
else:
    print(n!)
```

This code will produce an invalid argument error for any negative number.

4. **Not handling zero correctly**

```
n = int(input())
if n == 0:
    print(1)
else:
    print(n!)
```

This code will produce a division by zero error for n = 0.

5. **Using an inefficient algorithm**

```
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

n = int(input())
print(factorial(n))
```

This code will be very inefficient for large numbers, as it will have to recalculate the factorial of all the numbers from 1 to n.

Here are some program inputs that will validate whether an implementation meets each of these requirements:

1. **Incorrect formula**

```
Input:
5

Output:
120
```

The correct output should be 120 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120 * 24 = 2880.

2. **Incorrect data type**

```
Input:
10

Output:
3628800
```

This output is incorrect because it is too large to be stored in an integer data type.

3. **Not handling negative numbers correctly**

```
Input:
-5

Output:
Invalid argument
```

This output is correct because the factorial of a negative number does not exist.

4. **Not handling zero correctly**

```
Input:
0

Output:
1
```

This output is correct because the factorial of 0 is 1.

5. **Using an inefficient algorithm**

```
Input:
10

Output:
3628800
```

This output is correct, but it is very inefficient because it has to recalculate the factorial of all the numbers from 1 to 10.

Here are some additional program inputs that you can use to test your implementation:

* Negative numbers
* Zero
* Numbers greater than 10
* Numbers that are not whole numbers
* Numbers that are not integers

You can also test your implementation by using a variety of different programming languages and platforms. This will help you to ensure that your implementation is robust and works in a variety of different environments.

1. **Incorrectly counting the number of "v"s in the string.** The most common mistake is to count every "v" as a single letter, even if it is part of a "w". This will result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Not considering the possibility that "w" could be represented by two consecutive "v"s.** If the string does not contain any "w", then this is not a problem. However, if the string does contain a "w", then it is possible that the "w" is actually represented by two consecutive "v"s. This means that the maximum length of the word is one more than the number of "v"s in the string.
3. **Not handling the case where the string is empty.** If the string is empty, then the minimum and maximum length of the word are both 0.
4. **Not handling the case where the string contains only "v"s.** If the string contains only "v"s, then the minimum and maximum length of the word are both the same as the number of "v"s in the string.
5. **Using a brute-force approach to solve the problem.** A brute-force approach to solving this problem would involve iterating over all possible combinations of the letters in the string and checking if each combination represents a valid word. This approach is very inefficient and will not work for large strings.
6. **Using a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.** A dynamic programming approach to solving this problem would involve building up a table of the minimum and maximum lengths of words that can be represented by the first k letters of the string. This approach is more efficient than a brute-force approach, but it is still not optimal.
7. **Using a greedy approach to solve the problem.** A greedy approach to solving this problem would involve greedily choosing the longest possible word that can be represented by the first k letters of the string. This approach is not optimal, but it is often faster than a dynamic programming approach.
8. **Using a heuristic approach to solve the problem.** A heuristic approach to solving this problem would involve using a rule of thumb to estimate the minimum and maximum lengths of words that can be represented by the first k letters of the string. This approach is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution, but it is often faster than a dynamic programming or greedy approach.

HACKEREARTH marut-vs-devil-army-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable names.** The variable names in the code are not very clear. For example, `n` and `N` are both used to represent the number of army men. This can lead to confusion and errors.
2. **Incorrect data types.** The data types of some of the variables are not correct. For example, `energy` is a `string`, but it should be an `int`. This can lead to errors when the code is executed.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic in the code is not correct. For example, the code does not correctly calculate the number of times Marut needs to drink "CodeRas". This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect error handling.** The code does not handle errors correctly. For example, if the input data is invalid, the code does not print an error message. This can lead to confusion for the user.
5. **Unnecessary code.** The code contains unnecessary code that does not contribute to the solution. For example, the code prints the value of `n` twice. This can lead to unnecessary clutter and make the code harder to read.
6. **Inefficient code.** The code is inefficient and can be improved. For example, the code could be rewritten to use a more efficient algorithm. This would improve the performance of the code.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use clear and descriptive variable names.
* Use the correct data types for your variables.
* Check your logic carefully to make sure it is correct.
* Handle errors correctly.
* Remove unnecessary code.
* Optimize your code for efficiency.

HACKEREARTH numbers-of-interest-2-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of modulo operator**. The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. For example, 10 % 3 is 1 because 10 divided by 3 has a remainder of 1. However, if you try to use the modulo operator with a negative number, you will get an incorrect result. For example, -10 % 3 is -1 instead of 2 because -10 divided by 3 has a remainder of 2, but -1 is negative.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when you forget to account for the first or last element in a list or array. For example, if you are trying to find the sum of the first 100 numbers, you need to start at 1 and end at 100, not 0 and 99.
3. **Incorrect use of recursion**. Recursion is a powerful programming technique, but it can be easy to make mistakes. One common mistake is to forget to include a base case in your recursive function. A base case is a condition that stops the recursion from continuing. For example, if you are writing a recursive function to find the factorial of a number, the base case would be when the number is 0.
4. **Incorrect use of dynamic programming**. Dynamic programming is a technique for optimizing recursive algorithms. It works by storing the results of intermediate calculations so that they don't have to be recomputed each time the function is called. For example, if you are writing a recursive function to find the Fibonacci sequence, you could use dynamic programming to store the results of the previous two Fibonacci numbers so that you don't have to recompute them each time the function is called.
5. **Incorrect use of big O notation**. Big O notation is a way of expressing the time complexity of an algorithm. It tells you how the running time of the algorithm grows as the input size grows. For example, the running time of a linear search algorithm is O(n), which means that the running time grows linearly as the input size grows.
6. **Incorrect use of space complexity**. Space complexity is a measure of the amount of memory that an algorithm uses. For example, the space complexity of a linked list is O(n), which means that the amount of memory used grows linearly as the number of elements in the list grows.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not specified clearly. For example, it is not clear whether the input should be a list of numbers or a string of numbers.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the rate per square foot:** The rate per square foot is calculated by multiplying the number marked on the plank by the sum of the digits of the number marked on the plank. However, it is not clear how to calculate the sum of the digits of a number.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the discount:** The discount is calculated by multiplying the rate per square foot by the appropriate discount rate. However, it is not clear how to determine the appropriate discount rate.
4. **Incorrect rounding of the cost of each plank after discount:** The cost of each plank after discount is rounded off to the nearest integer. However, it is not clear how to round the cost to the nearest integer.
5. **Incorrect calculation of the total amount to be paid:** The total amount to be paid is calculated by multiplying the number of planks by the cost of each plank. However, it is not clear how to calculate the number of planks.

HACKEREARTH shooting-balls

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The problem statement specifies that `n` and `m` are integers, but the code uses them as strings. This will cause errors when performing mathematical operations on them.
2. **Off-by-one error:** The code incorrectly calculates the number of balls that were not shot by the first contestant. It should be `n + m - 2`, but the code calculates `n + m - 1`.
3. **Incorrect logic:** The code incorrectly calculates the number of balls that were not shot by the second contestant. It should be `n + m - 2`, but the code calculates `n + m - 3`.

To fix these problems, we can do the following:

1. **Use the correct variable type:** Change the type of `n` and `m` to `int`.
2. **Fix the off-by-one error:** Change the calculation of the number of balls that were not shot by the first contestant to `n + m - 2`.
3. **Fix the incorrect logic:** Change the calculation of the number of balls that were not shot by the second contestant to `n + m - 2`.

With these changes, the code will correctly solve the problem.

Title:
ATCODER p02541 ACL Contest 1 - Sum is Multiple

Pain points:
**1. Using a naive approach**

A naive approach to solve this problem would be to iterate over all possible values of `k` from 1 to `N`, and check if `(1 + 2 + ... + k)` is a multiple of `N`. This approach would have a time complexity of `O(N)`, which is not efficient enough for large values of `N`.

**2. Using the Euclidean algorithm**

The Euclidean algorithm can be used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`. The GCD of `a` and `b` is the largest integer that divides both `a` and `b` evenly.

We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of `N` and `k`. If the GCD of `N` and `k` is 1, then `(1 + 2 + ... + k)` is a multiple of `N`. Otherwise, we can find the smallest positive integer `k` such that `(1 + 2 + ... + k)` is a multiple of `N` by adding `N` to `k` until the GCD of `N` and `k` is 1.

The time complexity of this approach is `O(log(N))`, which is much more efficient than the naive approach.

**3. Using the Chinese remainder theorem**

The Chinese remainder theorem can be used to solve a system of linear congruences. A system of linear congruences is a set of equations of the form `a_i x \equiv b_i \pmod{m_i}`, where `i` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `a_i` and `m_i` are integers, and `b_i` is an integer.

The Chinese remainder theorem states that if `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n` are pairwise coprime, then there exists a unique integer `x` such that `x \equiv b_i \pmod{m_i}` for all `i` from 1 to `n`.

We can use the Chinese remainder theorem to solve this problem by setting `m_i = N` for all `i` from 1 to `N`, and setting `b_i = i` for all `i` from 1 to `N`. The unique integer `x` that satisfies all of these congruences is the smallest positive integer `k` such that `(1 + 2 + ... + k)` is a multiple of `N`.

The time complexity of this approach is `O(N log(N))`, which is more efficient than the Euclidean algorithm.

**4. Using a dynamic programming approach**

A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by building up a table of values `dp[i][j]`, where `i` is an integer from 1 to `N` and `j` is an integer from 0 to `N`. The value of `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum possible value of `k` such that `(1 + 2 + ... + k)` is a multiple of `N` and `k` is less than or equal to `j`.

We can initialize the table `dp` as follows:

```
dp[i][0] = 0
```

for all `i` from 1 to `N`.

We can then fill in the rest of the table by using the following recurrence relation:

```
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1] + i)
```

for all `i` from 1 to `N` and `j` from 1 to `N`.

The value of `dp[N][N]` is the smallest possible value of `k` such that `(1 + 2 + ... + k)` is a multiple of `N`.

The time complexity of this approach is `O(N^2)`, which is more efficient than the naive approach and the Euclidean algorithm.
Test inputs:
**1. Program input that tests for the naive approach**

N = 10

2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be the letter that follows the input letter in alphabetical order. If the output is not in the correct format, the program will not work as expected.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When checking if the input letter is `z`, it is important to make sure that the check is done correctly. If the check is done incorrectly, the program may output the wrong letter.
4. **Incorrect character encoding.** The program should be able to handle input and output in different character encodings. If the program is not able to handle different character encodings, it may not work correctly on all systems.
5. **Memory leaks.** The program should not leak memory. If the program leaks memory, it may eventually crash or run out of memory.
6. **Race conditions.** The program should not be susceptible to race conditions. If the program is susceptible to race conditions, it may produce incorrect results or crash.

Title:
ATCODER p02937 AtCoder Beginner Contest 138 - Strings of Impurity

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of `s.find()`**

The `s.find()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring `t` in the string `s`. If `t` is not found in `s`, `s.find()` returns `-1`.

In the following code, the developer attempts to use `s.find()` to find the first occurrence of the substring `t` in the string `s'`. However, `s'` is much longer than `t`, so `s.find()` will always return `-1`.

```
s = input()
t = input()
s' = s * 10 ** 100

if s.find(t) != -1:
    print(s.find(t))
else:
    print(-1)
```

**2. Incorrect use of `s.count()`**

The `s.count()` method returns the number of occurrences of the substring `t` in the string `s`.

In the following code, the developer attempts to use `s.count()` to find the number of occurrences of the substring `t` in the string `s'`. However, `s'` is much longer than `t`, so `s.count()` will always return a number greater than or equal to the length of `t`.

```
s = input()
t = input()
s' = s * 10 ** 100

if s.count(t) != -1:
    print(s.count(t))
else:
    print(-1)
```

**3. Incorrect use of `s[i:j]`**

The `s[i:j]` slice operator returns a substring of the string `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j`.

In the following code, the developer attempts to use `s[i:j]` to get a substring of the string `s'` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j`. However, `j` is greater than the length of `s'`, so the slice operator will return an empty string.

```
s = input()
t = input()
s' = s * 10 ** 100

i = 0
j = len(s')
while i < j:
    if t in s[i:j]:
        print(i)
        break
    i += 1
else:
    print(-1)
```

**4. Incorrect use of `s[i]`**

The `s[i]` subscript operator returns the character at index `i` in the string `s`.

In the following code, the developer attempts to use `s[i]` to get the character at index `i` in the string `s'`. However, `i` is greater than the length of `s'`, so the subscript operator will cause an error.

```
s = input()
t = input()
s' = s * 10 ** 100

i = 0
while i < len(s'):
    if t[0] == s[i]:
        print(i)
        break
    i += 1
else:
    print(-1)
```

**5. Incorrect use of `break`**

The `break` statement terminates the loop in which it is used.

In the following code, the developer uses `break` to terminate the loop as soon as the first occurrence of the substring `t` is found in the string `s'`. However, this will not work because the loop will continue to iterate until `i` reaches the end of `s'`, even if `t` is not found.

```
s = input()
t = input()
s' = s * 10 ** 100

i = 0
while i < len(s'):
    if t in s[i:]:
        print(i)
        break
    i += 1
else:
    print(-1)
```

Title:
ATCODER p03074 AtCoder Beginner Contest 124 - Handstand

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of consecutive people standing on hands.**

The most important thing to remember when solving this problem is that the maximum number of consecutive people standing on hands is not necessarily the same as the number of people standing on hands after applying the directions. For example, if the input is `N = 5, K = 1, S = 00010`, then the maximum number of consecutive people standing on hands is 4, but after applying the direction `l = 1, r = 5`, the number of people standing on hands is only 3.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to keep track of the number of people standing on hands before and after applying each direction. This can be done by using a simple `int` variable to store the number of people standing on hands, and then incrementing or decrementing this variable each time a direction is applied.

**2. Forgetting to check the constraints.**

Another common mistake is to forget to check the constraints on the input. For example, the input `N = 10^6, K = 10^6` is invalid because `N` and `K` are both greater than `10^5`. To avoid this mistake, it is important to check the constraints before starting to solve the problem.

**3. Using incorrect data types.**

The input `N = 10^5` and `S = 10^5` characters long requires `int` and `string` data types, respectively. Using a smaller data type, such as `short` or `char`, will result in incorrect output.

**4. Using incorrect algorithms.**

The naive algorithm for solving this problem is to iterate through the input string and count the number of consecutive people standing on hands. This algorithm has a time complexity of `O(N)`, which is too slow for large values of `N`. A more efficient algorithm is to use dynamic programming.

**5. Not debugging the code.**

Even after carefully following the steps above, it is still possible to make mistakes. The best way to avoid these mistakes is to thoroughly debug the code. This can be done by running the code on a variety of test cases, and checking the output for correctness.

Here are some tips for debugging the code:

* Use a debugger to step through the code line by line. This can help you identify errors in the logic.
* Print out the values of important variables at each step of the code. This can help you track the flow of the code and identify errors.
* Use unit tests to test small pieces of the code. This can help you identify errors in the individual functions.

By following these tips, you can significantly reduce the number of bugs in your code.

ATCODER p03216 Dwango Programming Contest V - k-DMC

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of triples.** The most common mistake is to incorrectly count the number of triples. For example, in the input string `DMCDMCDMCDMCDMCDMCDMCDMCDMCDMC`, the number of triples with `k = 5` is `10`, not `20`. This is because the triples `(0, 5, 10)` and `(0, 10, 15)` are counted twice.
2. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are a few different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. The most efficient algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm. This algorithm works by building up a table of the number of triples with each possible value of `k`.
3. **Incorrectly handling the boundary conditions.** The boundary conditions for this problem can be tricky. For example, if `k = N`, then there are no triples that satisfy the constraints.
4. **Not handling errors correctly.** The input for this problem may contain errors. For example, the input string may not contain any `D`, `M`, or `C` characters. If the input is invalid, the program should print an error message and exit.
5. **Not using the correct data types.** The data types used to store the input and output data can have a significant impact on the performance of the program. For example, using a `string` to store the input string will be much slower than using a `char[]`.
6. **Not using efficient data structures.** The data structures used to store the input and output data can also have a significant impact on the performance of the program. For example, using a `HashMap` to store the number of triples with each possible value of `k` will be much faster than using a `List`.
7. **Not using the right optimizations.** There are a number of optimizations that can be used to improve the performance of the program. For example, the program can be parallelized to run on multiple cores.
8. **Not testing the program thoroughly.** It is important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly. This includes testing the program with both valid and invalid input data.

ATCODER p03365 AtCoder Grand Contest 023 - Painting Machines

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The most common mistake is to implement the algorithm incorrectly. This can lead to incorrect results or even a runtime error.

**2. Using incorrect data types**

Another common mistake is to use incorrect data types. For example, using an integer to store a floating-point number can lead to incorrect results.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

It is important to handle edge cases carefully. For example, if the input is invalid, the program should print an error message and exit.

**4. Using inefficient algorithms**

Using an inefficient algorithm can lead to a slow program. For example, using a brute-force algorithm to solve a problem can be very slow.

**5. Not using appropriate data structures**

Using the wrong data structure can also lead to a slow program. For example, using a linked list to store a sorted array can be very slow.

Title:
AIZU p00388 Design of a Mansion

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is "$H$ $A$ $B$", where $H$ is the height of the condominium, $A$ is the lower limit of the height adjustable range, and $B$ is the upper limit of the height adjustable range. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data should be integers. If the input data is not an integer, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect range of values**. The height of the condominium, $H$, should be between 1 and 10^5. The lower limit of the height adjustable range, $A$, should be between 1 and $H$. The upper limit of the height adjustable range, $B$, should be between $A$ and $H$. If any of these values are incorrect, the program will crash.
4. **Off-by-one error**. When calculating the number of possible height selections for each floor, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, if the height of the condominium is 100 and the adjustable range is 2 to 4, the number of possible height selections is 3, not 4.

Title:
AIZU p00741 How Many Islands?

Pain points:
**Possible Problems and Bugs**

1. **Incorrectly identifying adjacent land areas.** When checking if two land areas are adjacent, it is important to consider all possible directions of adjacency (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal). For example, in the following map, the two land areas on the left are not adjacent, even though they are vertically aligned.

```
0 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 0
```

2. **Counting the same island multiple times.** When a land area is visited, it is important to mark it as visited so that it is not counted again. For example, in the following map, the two land areas on the left are counted as two separate islands, even though they are connected.

```
0 1 0
0 1 0
0 0 0
```

3. **Not handling boundary cases correctly.** The input may contain maps with zero width or height, or with negative width or height. It is important to handle these cases gracefully.

4. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. It is important to choose an algorithm that is appropriate for the size of the input.

5. **Making a programming error.** Even the most experienced programmers make mistakes. It is important to carefully check your code for errors before submitting it.

Here are some specific examples of programming errors that you might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over the rows or columns of a map, it is easy to make an off-by-one error and skip a land area or count a land area twice.
* **Incorrect array indexing.** When accessing the elements of an array, it is easy to make a mistake and index out of bounds.
* **Incorrect variable initialization.** When initializing variables, it is important to make sure that they are initialized to the correct values.
* **Incorrect logic.** When writing the logic for your algorithm, it is important to make sure that it is correct.

By being aware of these potential problems and bugs, you can increase your chances of writing a correct and efficient solution to this problem.

Title:
AIZU p01282 Revenge of the Round Table

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulo operation.** When performing modulo operations, it is important to make sure that the result is always less than the modulo value. This can be done by using the `%` operator in Python. For example, the following code will always return a value less than 10:

```python
n = 11
print(n % 10)
```

2. **Incorrect use of the factorial function.** The factorial function, `math.factorial()`, returns the product of all the integers from 1 to a given number. For example, the following code will return the value 120:

```python
n = 5
print(math.factorial(n))
```

However, it is important to note that the factorial function can only be used for positive integers. If you try to use it with a negative number, you will get an error.

3. **Incorrect use of the binomial coefficient.** The binomial coefficient, `math.comb()`, returns the number of ways to choose `k` items from a set of `n` items. For example, the following code will return the value 6:

```python
n = 6
k = 3
print(math.comb(n, k))
```

However, it is important to note that the binomial coefficient can only be used for non-negative integers. If you try to use it with a negative number, you will get an error.

4. **Incorrect use of the fibonacci function.** The fibonacci function, `fibonacci()`, returns the value of the nth fibonacci number. For example, the following code will return the value 5:

```python
n = 5
print(fibonacci(n))
```

However, it is important to note that the fibonacci function can only be used for non-negative integers. If you try to use it with a negative number, you will get an error.

5. **Incorrect use of the prime number generator.** The prime number generator, `primes()`, returns a list of all the prime numbers less than a given number. For example, the following code will return the list of all the prime numbers less than 10:

```python
n = 10
print(primes(n))
```

However, it is important to note that the prime number generator can only be used for positive integers. If you try to use it with a negative number, you will get an error.

Title:
AIZU p01452 10-Year-Old Dynamic Programming

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is N, M, K, where N and M are positive integers and K is a non-negative integer. If the input format is incorrect, an error will be thrown.
2. **Incorrect value of K**. K must be a non-negative integer. If K is negative, an error will be thrown.
3. **Incorrect value of N and M**. N and M must be positive integers. If N or M is negative, an error will be thrown.
4. **Arithmetic overflow**. The number of ways to go from (0, 0) to (N, M) with K detours can be very large. If the number of ways is too large, an arithmetic overflow error will be thrown.
5. **Incorrect modulo operation**. The number of ways to go from (0, 0) to (N, M) with K detours is a large number. When dividing this number by 1,000,000,007, an incorrect modulo operation may be performed. This can lead to the wrong answer being returned.
6. **Other bugs**. There may be other bugs in the code that are not listed here.

To avoid these problems, it is important to test the code thoroughly before deploying it to production. This can be done by creating a test suite that includes a variety of input values, including invalid input values. The test suite should also check for arithmetic overflow and incorrect modulo operations. By testing the code thoroughly, you can help to ensure that it is free of bugs and that it will produce the correct results.

Title:
AIZU p01602 Parentheses

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of parentheses.** The problem statement specifies that the input should be a string of parentheses, but some solutions may incorrectly use brackets or other characters. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect handling of empty strings.** The problem statement specifies that the empty string is balanced, but some solutions may incorrectly treat it as unbalanced. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect handling of unbalanced strings.** The problem statement specifies that a string is unbalanced if it contains an odd number of opening parentheses, but some solutions may incorrectly treat a string as balanced even if it contains an odd number of opening parentheses. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect handling of nested parentheses.** The problem statement specifies that a string is balanced if it can be formed by nesting pairs of parentheses, but some solutions may incorrectly treat a string as unbalanced even if it can be formed by nesting pairs of parentheses. This can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect handling of large numbers.** The problem statement specifies that the input numbers can be up to 10^6, but some solutions may incorrectly overflow when processing these numbers. This can lead to incorrect results.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement, and to use a robust and well-tested solution.

Title:
AIZU p02466 Set Symmetric Difference

Pain points:
**1. Using an inefficient sorting algorithm**

The naive approach to solving this problem would be to sort the two sets and then compare each element in one set to each element in the other set. This would take $\Theta(n \log n + m \log m)$ time.

**2. Using a hash table to store the elements of one set**

A more efficient approach would be to use a hash table to store the elements of one set. This would allow us to check if an element is in the set in $\Theta(1)$ time. We could then iterate over the elements of the other set and add any elements that are not in the hash table to the output. This would take $\Theta(n + m)$ time.

**3. Using a disjoint set data structure**

A disjoint set data structure can be used to track the sets of elements that have already been processed. This would allow us to avoid adding duplicate elements to the output. This would take $\Theta(n + m)$ time.

**4. Using a bit vector to represent the sets**

A bit vector can be used to represent the sets of elements that have already been processed. This would allow us to check if an element is in a set in $\Theta(1)$ time. We could then iterate over the elements of the other set and add any elements that are not in the bit vector to the output. This would take $\Theta(n + m)$ time.

**5. Using a binary search to find the next element in the output**

Once we have the elements of the symmetric difference in a sorted list, we can use a binary search to find the next element in the output. This would take $\Theta(\log n)$ time per element.

**6. Using a stream processing algorithm**

A stream processing algorithm can be used to process the elements of the two sets one at a time and add any elements that are not in the symmetric difference to the output. This would take $\Theta(n + m)$ time.

**7. Using a parallel algorithm**

The problem can be parallelized by splitting the two sets into smaller sets and then computing the symmetric difference of each pair of sets in parallel. This would take $\Theta((n + m) / p)$ time, where $p$ is the number of processors.
