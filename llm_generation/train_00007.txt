Title:
CODECHEF abhstr

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of data types.** The problem states that the input string will contain only lowercase alphabets, so the developer should use a string data type to store the input. However, if the developer uses an integer data type, they may encounter a `TypeError` when trying to access the characters in the string.
2. **Incorrect use of comparison operators.** The problem states that the winner is the one whose character has a higher ASCII value. However, if the developer uses the `>` operator to compare characters, they may get an incorrect result because the ASCII value of a character is not the same as its position in the alphabet.
3. **Incorrect use of string functions.** The problem states that the winner is the one who finds the first character that appears only once in the entire string. However, if the developer uses the `count()` function to check if a character appears more than once, they may get an incorrect result because the `count()` function returns the number of times a character appears in the string, not the first time it appears.
4. **Incorrect use of loops.** The problem states that both Shanky and Anku will traverse the string from beginning to end. However, if the developer uses a `for` loop to traverse the string, they may get an incorrect result because the `for` loop will only iterate over the characters in the first half of the string.
5. **Incorrect use of conditions.** The problem states that the winner is the one who finds the first character that appears only once in the entire string. However, if the developer uses an incorrect condition to check if a character appears only once, they may get an incorrect result.
6. **Incorrect use of output.** The problem states that the output should be a single line containing the winner's name. However, if the developer outputs multiple lines of text, they may get an incorrect result.

Title:
CODECHEF chefluck

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be `T N` where `T` is the number of test cases and `N` is the number of digits in the lucky lucky number. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format should be `count_of_digit_4` where `count_of_digit_4` is the count of digit 4 in the smallest lucky lucky number. If the output format is incorrect, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program should first check if it is possible to form a Lucky lucky number having `N` digits. If it is possible, the program should find the smallest Lucky lucky number and output the count of digit 4 in the number. If it is not possible, the program should output `-1`.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The program should be careful about off-by-one errors. For example, if `N` is 11, the smallest Lucky lucky number is `4777777777`. The count of digit 4 is 7, not 8.
5. **Memory leak**. The program should be careful about memory leaks. For example, the program should free any allocated memory after it is no longer needed.

Title:
CODECHEF dividing

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain a space between two integers, or it may contain a newline character instead of a comma.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correctly followed. For example, the output may contain a space between two words, or it may contain a newline character instead of a semicolon.
3. **Incorrect calculations**. The developer may make a mistake in their calculations, such as adding two numbers incorrectly or dividing two numbers incorrectly.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may make a mistake in their logic, such as assuming that a certain condition is true when it is not, or vice versa.
5. **Incorrect use of data structures**. The developer may use the wrong data structure for the problem, or they may use the data structure incorrectly.
6. **Incorrect use of algorithms**. The developer may use the wrong algorithm for the problem, or they may use the algorithm incorrectly.
7. **Incorrect error handling**. The developer may not handle errors correctly, such as if the input is invalid or if the program encounters an unexpected exception.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly for all possible inputs.

Title:
CODECHEF introsrm

Pain points:
1. **Using the wrong data type.** The problem states that the input can be as large as 10^18, so using an integer data type is not sufficient. We need to use a long long data type to store the input.
2. **Not using the modulus operator.** The problem states that the output should be the reverse of the input, but not the negative of the reverse. To get the reverse of a number, we need to divide it by 10 and keep the remainder.
3. **Not using the bitwise operators.** The bitwise operators can be used to quickly reverse a number. For example, to reverse the number 1234, we can use the following code:

```
int reversed = 0;
while (n > 0) {
    reversed = reversed * 10 + n % 10;
    n = n / 10;
}
```

4. **Not using the string functions.** The string functions can be used to easily convert a number to a string and then reverse the string. For example, the following code can be used to reverse the number 1234:

```
string str = to_string(n);
reverse(str.begin(), str.end());
int reversed = stoi(str);
```

5. **Not using the built-in reverse function.** The C++ standard library provides a built-in function called reverse() that can be used to reverse a vector. For example, the following code can be used to reverse the vector {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}:

```
vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
reverse(v.begin(), v.end());

2. **Incorrect variable types**. The program may not be able to handle variables of the wrong type. For example, if a variable is declared as an integer but is assigned a floating-point value, the program may crash.
3. **Incorrect mathematical operations**. The program may perform mathematical operations incorrectly. For example, if the program tries to divide by zero, it will crash.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The program may have incorrect logic, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program does not check for errors, it may produce incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect output format**. The program may not output the results in the correct format. For example, if the program outputs a float when it should output an integer, the results will be incorrect.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format, variable types, mathematical operations, logic, and output format.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1027_B. Numbers on the Chessboard

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format of the problem is very specific. Make sure that you are reading the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format of the problem is also very specific. Make sure that you are printing the output in the correct format.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** The chessboard is a 2D grid, so it is easy to make off-by-one errors when computing the row and column indices of a cell.
4. **Arithmetic errors.** The numbers on the chessboard can be very large, so it is important to be careful when performing arithmetic operations.
5. **Memory errors.** The chessboard can be very large, so it is important to be careful about memory usage.
6. **Time errors.** The problem can be solved in O(n^2) time, so it is important to be careful about your algorithm's running time.
7. **Concurrency errors.** If you are using a multi-threaded or multi-process programming model, it is important to be careful about synchronization issues.
8. **Testing errors.** It is important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format of the problem specifies that the first line should contain two integers n and q. However, if the input file contains only one integer, the program will crash.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format of the problem specifies that the output should be a list of numbers, one per line. However, if the program prints the output in a different format, the judges will not be able to evaluate it correctly.
* **Off-by-one errors:** The chessboard is a 2D grid, so it is easy to make off-by-one errors when computing the row and column indices of a cell. For example, the following code would print the wrong answer for the query (1, 1):

```
row = int(input())
column = int(input())

print(row + column)
```

The correct answer is 1, but the code above prints 2.
* **Arithmetic errors:** The numbers on the chessboard can be very large, so it is important to be careful when performing arithmetic operations. For example, the following code would overflow for large values of n:

```
sum = 0
for i in range(n):
  for j in range(n):
    sum += i + j

print(sum)
```

The correct way to compute the sum of all the numbers on the chessboard is to use the following formula:

```
sum = (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) // 6
```

* **Memory errors:** The chessboard can be very large, so it is important to be careful about memory usage. For example, the following code would allocate a very large amount of memory:

```
board = [[0] * n for i in range(n)]
```

A more efficient way to allocate the memory for the chessboard is to use the following code:

```
board = [[0] for i in range(n)]
for i in range(n):
  board[i] = [0] * n
```

* **Time errors:** The problem can be solved in O(n^2) time, so it is important to be careful about your algorithm's running time. For example, the following algorithm would take O(n^3) time to solve the problem:

```
for i in range(n):
  for j in range(n):
    for k in range(n):
      print(i + j + k)
```

A more efficient algorithm would be to use the following formula to compute the answer to each query:

```
answer = (i + j + 1) * (i + j + 2) // 2
```

* **Concurrency errors:** If you are using a multi-threaded or multi-process programming model, it is important to be careful about synchronization issues. For example, the following code would deadlock:

```
def worker(i):
  print(i)

for i in range(n):
  t = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(i,))
  t.start()
```

The correct way to write this code would be to use the following code:

```
def worker(i):
  print(i)

for i in range(n):
  t =

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is "1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6", but the user may accidentally enter a number that is less than 1 or greater than 10^6. This will cause the program to crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is "a single integer", but the user may accidentally output multiple integers or a non-integer value. This will cause the program to crash.

**3. Incorrect calculation**

The user may make a mistake in their calculation and output an incorrect answer. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as using the wrong formula, making a mistake in the order of operations, or using incorrect data.

**4. Runtime error**

The program may run into a runtime error if it tries to access memory that it does not have permission to access, or if it tries to divide by zero. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as a programming error, a hardware problem, or a software problem.

**5. Logical error**

Title:
CODEFORCES 1110_B. Tape

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data contains a lot of integers. If you use the wrong data type to store them, you may get incorrect results. For example, if you use `int` to store the number of broken segments `n`, and `n` is larger than `2147483647`, you will get an incorrect result.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The problem can be solved using dynamic programming. However, if you use an incorrect algorithm, you may get an incorrect result. For example, if you use the following algorithm to solve the problem:

```
def solve(n, m, k):
    # Initialize the DP table.
    dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]

    # Fill the DP table.
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            # If the current segment is not broken, we can skip it.
            if j not in broken_segments:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
            else:
                # Otherwise, we need to find the minimum total length of the pieces that can cover the current segment.
                for l in range(1, j + 1):
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][l - 1] + j - l + 1)

    # Return the minimum total length of the pieces.
    return dp[k][m]
```

This algorithm is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that we can overlap pieces of tape. For example, if the broken segments are `[1, 3, 5]` and we have two pieces of tape, we can use one piece to cover segments `[1, 2]` and the other piece to cover segments `[3, 4]`. However, the above algorithm will return `6`, which is incorrect.

**3. Not handling the corner cases correctly**

The problem has a few corner cases that you need to handle correctly. For example, if `n == 0`, the answer is `0`. If `k == 0`, the answer is `m`. If `m == 1`, the answer is `0`.

**4. Formatting the output incorrectly**

The output should be a single integer. If you format the output incorrectly, you will get a wrong answer. For example, if you output `12345` instead of `12345`, you will get a wrong answer.

CODEFORCES 1199_B. Water Lily

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect calculation of the slope of the line.** The slope of the line is calculated as `(L - H) / L`. However, this is incorrect because the line is not a straight line, but a curve. The correct slope is `(L - H) / (L - H)`.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the depth of the lake.** The depth of the lake is calculated as `H / (L - H)`. However, this is incorrect because the depth of the lake is not constant. The correct depth of the lake is `H / (L - H)`, where `H` is the height of the water lily and `L` is the distance from the water lily to the point where the stem touches the water surface.
3. **Incorrect rounding of the depth of the lake.** The depth of the lake should be rounded to the nearest thousandth. However, many programmers round the depth of the lake to the nearest integer. This can lead to errors in the output.
4. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.** Floating-point numbers are not precise. This means that when you perform calculations with floating-point numbers, you may get rounding errors. To avoid these errors, you should use the `round()` function to round floating-point numbers to the nearest integer.
5. **Incorrect use of the `cin` and `cout` functions.** The `cin` and `cout` functions can be used to read and write data from the console. However, these functions are not thread-safe. This means that if you call these functions from multiple threads, you may get inconsistent results. To avoid this problem, you should use the `std::cin` and `std::cout` functions instead.

CODEFORCES 1324_E. Sleeping Schedule

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input contains a non-integer number, the program may not be able to parse it correctly and will crash.
2. **Incorrect variable type**. The variable types used in the program may not be correct, which may cause the program to give incorrect results. For example, if the variable `n` is declared as an integer, but the input contains a non-integer number, the program may not be able to store the number correctly and will give incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic used in the program may be incorrect, which may cause the program to give incorrect results. For example, if the program does not take into account all of the constraints, it may give incorrect results.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can cause the program to give incorrect results. For example, if the program is supposed to print the number of good sleeping times, but the programmer forgets to increment the variable by one, the program will print one less than the correct number of good sleeping times.
5. **Indexing errors**. Indexing errors occur when the programmer accesses an element of an array or list using an incorrect index. This can cause the program to crash or give incorrect results. For example, if the program is supposed to access the first element of an array, but the programmer accesses the second element instead, the program will crash or give incorrect results.
6. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when the programmer allocates memory for a variable but does not free it when the variable is no longer needed. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash. For example, if the program allocates memory for an array but does not free it when the array is no longer needed, the program will eventually run out of memory and crash.
7. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to give incorrect results or crash. For example, if two threads are trying to update the same variable at the same time, the program may not update the variable correctly or it may crash.
8. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely. For example, if two threads are both trying to lock the same resource, the program will hang indefinitely until one of the threads releases the lock.

CODEFORCES 1365_E. Maximum Subsequence Value

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the binary search algorithm**

The binary search algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that can be used to find the position of a given element in a sorted array. However, if the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect, it may not return the correct result.

**2. Using an incorrect data structure**

The data structure used to store the input data can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. For example, using a linked list to store the input data would be much slower than using a sorted array.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve a given problem. However, not all algorithms are created equal. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. It is important to choose the correct algorithm for the problem being solved.

**4. Using incorrect input data**

The input data can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. For example, if the input data is not sorted, it may take the algorithm longer to find the correct result.

**5. Not handling edge cases**

It is important to handle edge cases when writing an algorithm. An edge case is a situation that is not explicitly handled by the algorithm. If an edge case is not handled correctly, it may cause the algorithm to crash or produce incorrect results.

**6. Not using appropriate data types**

The data types used to store the input data and the output data can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. For example, using a 64-bit integer to store a value that can only be represented by a 32-bit integer would be inefficient.

**7. Not using appropriate constants**

The constants used in an algorithm can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. For example, using a large constant for the number of iterations in a loop would slow down the algorithm.
Test inputs:
```
# 1. Incorrect implementation of the binary search algorithm

* Using the wrong data type for the output. For example, if the output is an integer, you might accidentally print it as a float.
* Not handling the edge cases correctly. For example, if the output is empty, you might accidentally crash your program.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm that you use to solve this problem is very important. If you use the wrong algorithm, you will not get the correct answer. Some common mistakes that people make include:

* Using a brute-force algorithm. This will often be too slow for large inputs.
* Using a recursive algorithm. This can be difficult to implement correctly and can often lead to stack overflow errors.
* Using a dynamic programming algorithm. This can be difficult to implement correctly and can often lead to time complexity issues.

**4. Incorrect debugging**

Title:
CODEFORCES 1428_A. Box is Pull

Pain points:
**Possible Problems**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the rope-pulling algorithm.** The algorithm should only allow Wabbit to pull the box if he is exactly 1 unit away from it in the direction of one of the two coordinate axes. It should also ensure that Wabbit moves out of the way in the same direction by 1 unit after pulling the box.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum amount of time required to move the box.** The time required to move the box should be calculated as the sum of the times required to travel 1 unit in each of the four directions.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The algorithm should be able to handle cases where the box is located at the origin or on one of the axes.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer representing the minimum amount of time required to move the box.

**Possible Bugs**

1. **Off-by-one errors.** The algorithm may incorrectly calculate the distance between Wabbit and the box, or the number of units that Wabbit needs to move to pull the box.
2. **Arithmetic errors.** The algorithm may incorrectly calculate the minimum amount of time required to move the box.
3. **Memory errors.** The algorithm may not properly allocate or free memory, leading to a segmentation fault or other errors.
4. **Synchronization errors.** The algorithm may not properly synchronize access to shared data, leading to race conditions or other errors.

**Recommendations**

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design and implement the rope-pulling algorithm. The algorithm should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it works correctly in all cases. Particular attention should be paid to edge cases and incorrect input. The output format should also be carefully verified to ensure that it is correct.

CODEFORCES 1451_A. Subtract or Divide

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the proper divisors function.** The proper divisors function should return all the positive integers that divide `n` evenly, except for `n` itself. For example, the proper divisors of `10` are `1`, `2`, `5`, and `10`.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the minimum moves function.** The minimum moves function should return the minimum number of moves required to reduce `n` to `1`. For example, the minimum number of moves required to reduce `10` to `1` is `3`, because we can first divide `10` by `2` to get `5`, then divide `5` by `5` to get `1`.
3. **Incorrect input handling.** The input should be a single integer `t` followed by `t` lines, each containing a single integer `n`. For example, the following input is incorrect:

```
1
2
3
```

The correct input should be:

```
3
2
3
```
4. **Incorrect output formatting.** The output should be a single line containing the minimum number of moves required to reduce `n` to `1`. For example, the correct output for `10` is `3`.
5. **Memory leaks.** The program should not allocate any memory that it does not free before exiting.
6. **Synchronization issues.** If the program is multi-threaded, it should ensure that all threads access shared data in a thread-safe manner.
7. **Race conditions.** If the program is multi-threaded, it should ensure that no two threads can access shared data at the same time.
8. **Deadlocks.** If the program is multi-threaded, it should ensure that no two threads can wait for each other indefinitely.
9. **Unhandled exceptions.** The program should catch and handle all exceptions that it can.
10. **Inefficient algorithms.** The program should use efficient algorithms to solve the problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1475_A. Odd Divisor

Pain points:
YES **1. Using the wrong data type**

The input for some test cases won't fit into 32-bit integer type, so you should use at least 64-bit integer type in your programming language. If you use a 32-bit integer type, you will get an incorrect answer for some test cases.

**2. Not checking if `n` is even**

The problem states that `n` should be divisible by an odd number greater than 1. If `n` is even, then it cannot be divisible by an odd number. So, you need to check if `n` is even before you try to find an odd divisor.

**3. Not finding all odd divisors**

The problem states that `n` should have an odd divisor greater than 1. However, it is possible for `n` to have multiple odd divisors greater than 1. You need to make sure that you find all of them.

**4. Using an incorrect algorithm**

There are many different algorithms that you can use to find odd divisors of a number. However, not all of them are correct. You need to make sure that you use an algorithm that is correct.

**5. Using incorrect input validation**

The input for this problem can be very large. You need to make sure that you validate your input correctly. If you don't, you may get an incorrect answer or your program may crash.

CODEFORCES 1525_A. Potion-making

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specified in the problem statement is "The first line contains the single t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.". A developer may incorrectly parse the input and expect a single integer on the first line, instead of a single line containing a single integer. This would cause the program to crash when it tries to read the second line of input.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specified in the problem statement is "For each test case, print the minimum number of steps to brew a good potion.". A developer may incorrectly print the number of steps to brew a potion, instead of the minimum number of steps. This would cause the program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic for determining the minimum number of steps to brew a potion is not correct. For example, a developer may incorrectly assume that the minimum number of steps is always equal to the absolute value of the difference between the desired percentage of essence and the current percentage of essence. This would cause the program to output incorrect results.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. A developer may make off-by-one errors when calculating the minimum number of steps to brew a potion. For example, a developer may incorrectly assume that the minimum number of steps is equal to the number of times that the current percentage of essence needs to be decreased or increased to reach the desired percentage of essence. This would cause the program to output incorrect results.
5. **Memory leaks**. A developer may not properly free up memory that is allocated during the execution of the program. This can lead to memory leaks, which can eventually cause the program to crash.

For example, if you forget to add 1 to the answer when computing the factorial, or if you don't correctly handle the case where `n = 1`, your answer will be incorrect.
3. **Memory leaks:** The Martian DNA problem can be solved in a recursive way, and it is easy to create a memory leak if you are not careful. For example, if you don't properly free the memory allocated for the forbidden pairs, your program will eventually run out of memory.
4. **Incorrect output format:** The output format for the Martian DNA problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when printing the answer. For example, if you forget to print the answer modulo `1000000007`, or if you print the answer in the wrong format, your submission will be incorrect.

**Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:**

1. **Be careful when reading the input:** Make sure that you correctly parse the `n, m, k` values as integers, and that you handle the forbidden pairs correctly.
2. **Check your work carefully:** It is easy to make a mistake when computing the final answer, so it is important to check your work carefully. Make sure that you add 1 to the answer when computing the factorial, and that you correctly handle the case where `n = 1`.
3. **Avoid memory leaks:** When solving the Martian DNA problem recursively, it is important to properly free the memory allocated for the forbidden pairs.
4. **Print the output in the correct format:** Make sure that you print the answer modulo `1000000007`, and that you print the answer in the correct format.

1. **Incorrect input format:** The input format is very specific and a developer may make a mistake when reading the input. For example, they may not correctly parse the number of names and surnames, or they may not correctly read the names and surnames themselves.
2. **Incorrect output format:** The output format is also very specific and a developer may make a mistake when writing the output. For example, they may not correctly format the name-surname pairs, or they may not correctly add the commas and spaces.
3. **Incorrect logic:** The logic of the solution is also very important and a developer may make a mistake when implementing it. For example, they may not correctly match the names and surnames, or they may not correctly order the name-surname pairs.
4. **Off-by-one errors:** Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that can occur when a developer is counting or indexing. For example, they may incorrectly count the number of names and surnames, or they may incorrectly index into the arrays of names and surnames.
5. **Memory errors:** Memory errors can occur when a developer allocates too much or too little memory. For example, they may allocate an array that is too small to hold all of the names and surnames, or they may allocate an array that is too large and waste memory.
6. **Time complexity:** The time complexity of the solution is also important and a developer may make a mistake when implementing it. For example, they may use a sorting algorithm that has a high time complexity, or they may use a brute-force algorithm that iterates over all possible combinations of names and surnames.
7. **Space complexity:** The space complexity of the solution is also important and a developer may make a mistake when implementing it. For example, they may allocate an array that is too large, or they may use a data structure that has a high space complexity.

**Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:**

1. **Be careful when reading the input:** Make sure that you correctly parse the number of names and surnames, and that you correctly read the names and surnames themselves.
2. **Be careful when writing the output:** Make sure that you correctly format the name-surname pairs, and that you correctly add the commas and spaces.
3. **Double-check your logic:** Make sure that you correctly match the names and surnames, and that you correctly order the name-surname pairs.
4. **Be careful with off-by-one errors:** Make sure that you correctly count the number of names and surnames, and that you correctly index into the arrays of names and surnames.
5. **Allocate memory carefully:** Make sure that you allocate enough memory to hold all of the names and surnames, but don't allocate more memory than you need.
6. **Use efficient algorithms:** Use sorting algorithms that have a low time complexity, and use data structures that have a low space complexity.
7. **Test your code thoroughly:** Test your code with a variety of input data to make sure that it works correctly.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly comparing the sides of the logos.** The problem states that the logos must be placed on a square billboard, so the sides of the logos must be able to form a square. However, a developer might accidentally compare the sides of the logos incorrectly, and conclude that they cannot be placed on a square billboard when they actually can.
2. **Not considering all possible rotations of the logos.** The problem states that the logos can be rotated, so a developer must consider all possible rotations when trying to place them on a square billboard. However, a developer might only consider a few rotations, and conclude that the logos cannot be placed on a square billboard when they actually can.
3. **Not checking for empty space.** The problem states that the billboard must not have any empty space, so a developer must check for empty space when placing the logos. However, a developer might forget to check for empty space, and conclude that the logos can be placed on a square billboard when they actually cannot.
4. **Using incorrect data types.** The problem states that the sides of the logos must be positive integers, so a developer must use the correct data types to store the sides of the logos. However, a developer might use incorrect data types, such as floating-point numbers, and get incorrect results.
5. **Not handling errors correctly.** The problem might contain errors, such as invalid input data. A developer must handle these errors correctly, such as by printing an error message and exiting the program.

CODEFORCES 788_C. The Great Mixing

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format should be `n, k`, where `n` is the desired carbon dioxide concentration and `k` is the number of Coke types. The second line should contain `k` integers, where the `i`th integer is the carbon dioxide concentration of the `i`th type of Coke.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer, which is the minimum number of liters needed to create a glass with carbon dioxide concentration `n`.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of liters.** The minimum number of liters needed to create a glass with carbon dioxide concentration `n` is the smallest integer `l` such that `n * l >= sum(a_i)`, where `a_i` is the carbon dioxide concentration of the `i`th type of Coke.
4. **Inefficient algorithm.** The naive algorithm for finding the minimum number of liters needed to create a glass with carbon dioxide concentration `n` is to iterate over all possible combinations of the `k` types of Coke and calculate the carbon dioxide concentration of each combination. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(k^2). A more efficient algorithm is to sort the `k` types of Coke by their carbon dioxide concentration and then iterate over the types of Coke in decreasing order of their carbon dioxide concentration. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(k log k).
5. **Memory leak.** The program may leak memory if it does not properly free the memory that it allocates. This can be avoided by using the `free()` function to free the memory that is no longer needed.
6. **Synchronization issues.** If the program is multi-threaded, it is important to ensure that the threads are synchronized properly. This can be done by using the `pthread_mutex_t` and `pthread_mutex_lock()` functions.
7. **Race conditions.** If the program is multi-threaded, it is important to avoid race conditions. A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even crashes. To avoid race conditions, it is important to use the `pthread_mutex_t` and `pthread_mutex_lock()` functions to synchronize access to shared data.
8. **Deadlocks.** If the program is multi-threaded, it is important to avoid deadlocks. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can lead to the program being stuck in an infinite loop. To avoid deadlocks, it is important to use the `pthread_mutex_t` and `pthread_mutex_lock()` functions correctly.
9. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program may contain security vulnerabilities if it does not properly validate user input. This can allow attackers to exploit the program to gain unauthorized access to the system. To avoid security vulnerabilities, it is important to use the `strtok()` function to sanitize user input.
10. **Bugs in the unit tests.** The unit tests may not be comprehensive or may not be testing the correct code. This can lead to the program being released with bugs that were not caught by the unit tests. To avoid this, it is important to write comprehensive and well-designed unit tests.

Title:
CODEFORCES 855_A. Tom Riddle's Diary

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of strings, so the developer should use a list of strings to store the names. Using an incorrect data type, such as a list of integers, could lead to incorrect results.

**2. Not using a loop**

The problem requires the developer to output n lines, each containing either "YES" or "NO". To do this, the developer needs to use a loop. Not using a loop will result in the incorrect output.

**3. Using an incorrect comparison operator**

The problem states that the output should be "YES" if there exists an index j such that si = sj and j < i. The developer should use the comparison operator "==" to check if two strings are equal. Using an incorrect comparison operator, such as "!=", could lead to incorrect results.

**4. Not handling the case where the input data is empty**

The problem does not specify what should happen if the input data is empty. The developer should handle this case by checking if the input data is empty and, if it is, outputting an empty line. Not handling this case could lead to a runtime error.

**5. Not handling the case where the input data contains duplicate strings**

The problem states that the output should be "YES" if there exists an index j such that si = sj and j < i. This means that the output should be "YES" if the input data contains duplicate strings. The developer should handle this case by checking if the input data contains duplicate strings and, if it does, outputting "YES" for each duplicate string. Not handling this case could lead to incorrect results.
Test inputs:
```
# 1. Using an incorrect data type

n = int(input())
names = [input() for i in range(n)]

for name in names:

```

```
# 2. Not using a loop

n = int(input())
names = [input() for i in range(n)]

if names[0] in names[1:]:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

```
# 3. Using an incorrect comparison operator

n = int(input())
names = [input() for i in range(n)]

for i in range(1, n):
    if names[i] != names[i - 1]:
        print('NO')

CODEFORCES 879_D. Teams Formation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The data type of the input values must be correct. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program must be correct. For example, if the program does not correctly calculate the number of participants in the line, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are common mistakes that can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program counts the number of participants in the line one less than the actual number, the output will be incorrect.
5. **Memory leaks.** Memory leaks can occur when the program does not release memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions.** Race conditions can occur when two or more parts of the program access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
7. **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks can occur when two or more parts of the program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish until the other one does. This can lead to the program running indefinitely or crashing.
8. **Unhandled exceptions.** Unhandled exceptions can occur when the program encounters an error that it cannot handle. This can lead to the program crashing or behaving unexpectedly.
9. **Security vulnerabilities.** Security vulnerabilities can occur when the program is not properly protected from malicious attacks. This can lead to unauthorized access to the program or data, or the program being used to spread malware.
10. **Performance issues.** The program may run slowly or use too much memory. This can be caused by a number of factors, such as inefficient algorithms, poor data structures, or unnecessary code.

Title:
CODEFORCES 903_A. Hungry Student Problem

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input is a list of integers, but the developer may accidentally use a list of strings or a list of floats. This will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator**. The developer may accidentally use the wrong comparison operator, such as `>` instead of `>=`. This will cause the program to output incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may accidentally forget to add or subtract 1 from a variable. This will cause the program to output incorrect results.
4. **Index out of bounds error**. The developer may accidentally try to access an element of a list that doesn't exist. This will cause the program to crash.
5. **Infinite loop**. The developer may accidentally create a loop that never terminates. This will cause the program to run forever.
6. **Incorrect function call**. The developer may accidentally call a function with the wrong arguments or in the wrong order. This will cause the program to output incorrect results or crash.
7. **Memory leak**. The developer may accidentally allocate memory that is never freed. This will eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
8. **Security vulnerability**. The developer may accidentally create a program that is vulnerable to attack. This could allow attackers to steal data or take control of the system.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully test your code before deploying it to production. You should also use a code review process to catch any errors that you may have missed.

Title:
CODEFORCES 925_B. Resource Distribution

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable types**. The input and output variables are not always correctly declared. For example, the input `n, x_1, x_2` should be declared as `int` instead of `str`.
2. **Incorrect comparison operators**. The comparison operators `>` and `<` should be used with care. For example, `n < 2` is incorrect because `n` is a positive integer.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are common when iterating over arrays or lists. For example, the following code will print the first `n - 1` elements of an array:
```
for i in range(n - 1):
    print(array[i])
```
4. **Indexing errors**. Indexing errors occur when you access an element of an array or list using an invalid index. For example, the following code will cause an error because `n` is less than 0:
```
print(array[n])
```
5. **Arithmetic errors**. Arithmetic errors can occur when you perform calculations with floating-point numbers. For example, the following code will print the wrong answer because of rounding errors:
```
print(1.0 / 3)
```
6. **Logical errors**. Logical errors occur when your code does not do what you intended it to do. For example, the following code will never print anything because the `while` loop will never terminate:
```
while True:
    pass

HACKEREARTH beta-testing

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format should be `n`, followed by `n` space-separated strings. If the input format is incorrect, the program should raise an error.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format should be `name number_of_times_used`, sorted in decreasing order of `number_of_times_used`. If the output format is incorrect, the program should raise an error.
3. **Inefficient algorithm.** The program should use an efficient algorithm to sort the data. A naive algorithm such as bubble sort or selection sort would be too slow.
4. **Memory leaks.** The program should be careful not to leak memory.
5. **Race conditions.** The program should be careful to avoid race conditions when accessing shared data.
6. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program should be careful to avoid security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* A developer might accidentally use an incorrect input format, such as `n, names` instead of `n`, `names`. This would cause the program to crash.
* A developer might accidentally output the data in the wrong format, such as `name number_of_times_used` instead of `name, number_of_times_used`. This would make the output difficult to read and understand.
* A developer might use an inefficient algorithm to sort the data, such as bubble sort or selection sort. This would cause the program to run slowly.
* A developer might accidentally leak memory by not freeing up memory that is no longer needed. This could eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
* A developer might accidentally create a race condition by accessing shared data without proper synchronization. This could cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
* A developer might accidentally create a security vulnerability by allowing users to input arbitrary data. This could allow attackers to inject malicious code into the program or to steal sensitive data.

HACKEREARTH connections

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not clear.** It is not clear whether the first line contains the number of laptops or the number of connections. It is also not clear whether the connections are listed in pairs or not.
2. The output format is not clear. It is not clear whether the output should be a list of connections or a single string.
3. The code does not handle invalid inputs correctly. For example, if the input contains a connection that does not exist, the code will crash.
4. The code is not efficient. It uses a nested loop to find all of the connections between two laptops. This can be very slow if there are a lot of laptops.
5. The code is not modular. It is difficult to reuse the code for other problems.
6. The code is not well-documented. It is difficult to understand what the code is doing.

Here are some suggestions for how to fix these problems:

1. The input format should be made more clear. The first line should contain the number of laptops, and the second line should contain the number of connections. The connections should be listed in pairs, with each pair separated by a comma.
2. The output format should be made more clear. The output should be a list of connections, with each connection in the format `<source> <destination>`.
3. The code should handle invalid inputs correctly. If the input contains a connection that does not exist, the code should print an error message and exit.
4. The code should be made more efficient. The nested loop can be replaced with a single loop that uses a hash table to store the connections. This will make the code much faster.
5. The code should be made more modular. The code can be broken up into separate functions for each of the following tasks: reading the input, finding the connections, and printing the output.
6. The code should be well-documented. The comments should explain what the code is doing and how it works.

HACKEREARTH find-mode

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly using the built-in `max()` function to find the mode.** The `max()` function returns the largest element in a list, not the most frequently occurring element. To find the mode, you need to use a different algorithm, such as the [count sort algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort).
2. **Not handling duplicate values correctly.** When counting the frequency of each element in the list, you need to make sure to account for duplicate values. One way to do this is to use a hash table or a dictionary.
3. **Not handling the case where there is no mode.** It is possible that a list of integers does not have a mode. In this case, you should print an empty list.
4. **Not printing the modes in non-increasing order.** The modes should be printed in non-increasing order, from largest to smallest.
5. **Using incorrect data types.** The list of integers should be stored in a data type that can handle large numbers, such as a `list` or a `set`.
6. **Not using the correct algorithm.** The algorithm you use to find the mode should be efficient, such as the [count sort algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort).

Title:
HACKEREARTH matrix-multiplication

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The developer may incorrectly type the variable type, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the developer defines a variable as an integer but then tries to assign a floating-point value to it, the program will throw an error.
2. **Incorrect operator usage:** The developer may incorrectly use operators, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the developer tries to divide two integers using the "/" operator, the program will throw an error because the "/" operator only works with floating-point values.
3. **Incorrect logic:** The developer may incorrectly write the logic for the program, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the developer tries to multiply two matrices that are not compatible, the program will throw an error.
4. **Off-by-one errors:** The developer may make off-by-one errors, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the developer tries to access an element in an array that is out of bounds, the program will throw an error.
5. **Memory leaks:** The developer may create memory leaks, which can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing. For example, if the developer creates a variable and then forgets to delete it, the variable will remain in memory and eventually cause the program to crash.
6. **Security vulnerabilities:** The developer may introduce security vulnerabilities, which can allow attackers to access sensitive data or take control of the program. For example, if the developer allows users to input data without validating it, attackers could use that data to exploit security vulnerabilities.

2. **Inefficient algorithm.** The algorithm used to solve this problem is inefficient. It takes O(N^2) time, where N is the length of the message. A more efficient algorithm would take O(N) time.
3. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single string, not a list of strings.
4. **Missing error handling.** The code does not handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input is invalid, the code will crash.
5. **Unclear code.** The code is not very clear and easy to understand. It would be better to use more comments to explain what the code is doing.

Here is a revised version of the code that addresses these issues:

```python
def raju_and_his_girlfriend(shift_time, press_time, time_limit, message):
  # Initialize the current key and the current time.
  current_key = 'KEY1'
  current_time = 0

  # Loop through the message, one character at a time.
  for character in message:
    # Calculate the time it takes to move to the next key.
    move_time = shift_time * (ord(current_key) - ord('KEY0'))

    # Calculate the time it takes to press the key.
    press_time = press_time * ord(character) - ord('a')

    # Calculate the total time it takes to type the character.
    total_time = move_time + press_time

    # If we have enough time, type the character.
    if current_time + total_time <= time_limit:
      current_key = character
      current_time += total_time

  # Return the part of the message that was sent.
  return current_key


def main():
  # Get the number of test cases.
  t = int(input())

  # Loop through the test cases.
  for _ in range(t):
    # Get the shift time, press time, and time limit.
    shift_time, press_time, time_limit = map(int, input().split())

    # Get the message.
    message = input()

    # Print the part of the message that was sent.
    print(raju_and_his_girlfriend(shift_time, press_time, time_limit, message))

HACKEREARTH simple-divison-1

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

When dividing two numbers, it is important to use the correct data type. If the numbers are large, they may overflow if you use a data type that is too small. For example, if you divide two integers that are both larger than 2147483647, the result will be 0 because the integer data type can only store numbers up to 2147483647.

**2. Using the wrong rounding method**

When dividing two numbers, you need to decide how to round the result. The most common rounding methods are rounding to the nearest integer, rounding to the nearest tenth, and rounding to the nearest hundredth. You need to choose the rounding method that is most appropriate for your application.

**3. Using the wrong precision**

The precision of a number is the number of digits after the decimal point. When dividing two numbers, you need to make sure that the precision of the result is the same as the precision of the operands. For example, if you divide two numbers that have a precision of 3, the result must also have a precision of 3.

**4. Using the wrong algorithm**

There are many different algorithms for dividing two numbers. The best algorithm to use depends on the size of the numbers and the required precision. For small numbers, you can use a simple algorithm like long division. For large numbers, you can use a more efficient algorithm like the Newton-Raphson method.

**5. Not handling errors correctly**

When dividing two numbers, there are a few different types of errors that can occur. You need to make sure that your code handles these errors correctly. For example, if you divide by zero, your code should throw an exception.

Title:
ATCODER p02940 AtCoder Grand Contest 037 - RGB Balls

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The most common bug is that the developer implements the algorithm incorrectly. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as:

* Misunderstanding the problem statement
* Making a mistake in the implementation
* Using incorrect data types
* Not handling edge cases correctly

To avoid this bug, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement. It is also helpful to write out the algorithm in pseudocode before implementing it in code. This will help to catch any mistakes in the logic before they are written into code.

**2. Using incorrect data types**

Another common bug is using incorrect data types. This can happen when the developer does not understand the limitations of the data types they are using. For example, using an integer to store a number that is too large can cause the program to overflow.

To avoid this bug, it is important to choose the correct data types for the values that you are storing. This will help to ensure that the program does not crash or produce incorrect results.

**3. Not handling edge cases correctly**

Edge cases are special cases that the developer must handle specifically. For example, if the input is empty, the program must handle this case correctly.

To avoid this bug, it is important to identify all of the edge cases in the problem statement. Then, the developer must write code to handle each of these cases correctly.

**4. Using an incorrect modulo**

The modulo operator (%) is used to find the remainder of a division. This can be useful for finding the number of ways to distribute balls in a problem like this.

However, it is important to use the correct modulo. In this problem, the modulo is 998244353. If the developer uses an incorrect modulo, the program will produce incorrect results.

To avoid this bug, it is important to make sure that the modulo is correct. This can be done by checking the problem statement or by consulting a reference.

Title:
ATCODER p03368 AtCoder Grand Contest 023 - 01 on Tree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm**

The tree traversal algorithm is a recursive algorithm that visits each node in a tree in a specific order. In this problem, the tree traversal algorithm is used to find the minimum possible inversion number of a sequence of numbers. However, if the algorithm is implemented incorrectly, it may not find the correct answer.

For example, the following incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm may not find the correct answer:

```
def dfs(node):
    # Visit the current node.
    print(node)

    # Recursively visit the child nodes of the current node.
    for child in node.children:
        dfs(child)
```

This implementation will visit the nodes in a preorder traversal order. This means that the first node visited will be the root node, followed by its left child, then its right child, and so on. However, the problem statement specifies that the nodes should be visited in a horizontal row, with no ancestor of a node to the right of that node. This means that the nodes should be visited in a postorder traversal order.

To fix this problem, the tree traversal algorithm should be implemented in a postorder traversal order. This can be done by changing the order of the recursive calls in the algorithm.

```
def dfs(node):
    # Recursively visit the child nodes of the current node.
    for child in node.children:
        dfs(child)

    # Visit the current node.
    print(node)
```

**2. Incorrect calculation of the inversion number**

The inversion number of a sequence of numbers is the number of pairs of elements in the sequence such that the first element is greater than the second element. In this problem, the inversion number of a sequence of numbers is used to measure the amount of disorder in the sequence.

The inversion number can be calculated by using the following formula:

```
Inversion number = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (i - j) * I[i, j]
```

where `n` is the length of the sequence, `i` and `j` are indices in the sequence, and `I[i, j]` is the indicator function that is equal to 1 if `i` is less than `j` and `0` otherwise.

For example, the inversion number of the sequence `[1, 3, 2]` is 2. This is because there are two pairs of elements in the sequence such that the first element is greater than the second element: `(1, 3)` and `(3, 2)`.

To calculate the inversion number of a sequence of numbers, the following steps can be used:

1. Create an array `I` of size `n` x `n`.
2. Initialize all elements of `I` to 0.
3. For each element `i` in the sequence, do the following:
    1. For each element `j` in the sequence such that `i` is less than `j`, do the following:
        1. Increment `I[i, j]` by 1.
4. Calculate the inversion number by summing the elements of `I`.

**3. Incorrect use of the `in` operator**

The `in` operator is used to check if an element is in a sequence. In this problem, the `in` operator is used to check if a node is in a list of nodes. However, if the list of nodes is not sorted, the `in` operator may not work correctly.

For example, the following code will not work correctly if the list of nodes is not sorted:

```
def is_node_in_list(node, node_list):
    for n in node_list:
        if n == node:
            return True
    return False
```

This is because the `in` operator will only return True if the node is found in the list in the same order as it was added to the list. If the list is not sorted, the node may not be found in the list in the same order as it was added, and the `in` operator will return False even if the node is actually in the list.

To fix this problem, the list of nodes should be sorted before the `in` operator is used.

**4. Incorrect use of the `min()` function**

The `min()` function is used to find the minimum value in a sequence. In this problem, the `min()` function is used to find the minimum inversion number of a sequence of numbers
Test inputs:
**Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm**

```
N = int(input())
P = list(map(int, input().split()))
V = list(map(int, input().split()))

def dfs(node):
    # Visit the current node.
    print(node)

    # Recursively visit the child nodes of the current node.
    for child in node.children:
        dfs(child)

dfs(1)
```

This implementation will visit the nodes in a preorder traversal order. This means that the first node visited will be the root node, followed by its left child, then its right child, and so on. However, the problem statement specifies that the nodes should be visited in a horizontal row, with no ancestor of a node to the right of that node. This means that the nodes should be visited in a postorder traversal order.

To fix this problem, the tree traversal algorithm should be implemented in a postorder traversal order. This can be done by changing the order of the recursive calls in the algorithm.

```
N = int(input())
P = list(map(int, input().split()))
V = list(map(int, input().split()))

def dfs(node):
    # Recursively visit the child nodes of the current node.
    for child in node.children:
        dfs(child)

    # Visit the current node.
    print(node)

dfs(1)
```

**Incorrect calculation of the inversion number**

```
N = int(input())
P = list(map(int, input().split()))
V = list(map(int, input().split()))

def calc_inversion_number(A):
    inversion_number = 0
    for i in range(1, N):
        for j in range(i + 1, N):
            if A[i] > A[j]:
                inversion_number += 1
    return inversion_number

print(calc_inversion_number(V))
```

This implementation of the inversion number calculation function is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the nodes are visited in a postorder traversal order. This means that the inversion number will be overestimated.

To fix this problem, the inversion number calculation function should be modified to take into account the fact that the nodes are visited in a postorder traversal order. This can be done by adding a check to the function to make sure that the first element in the sequence is less than or equal to the second element.

```
N = int(input())
P = list(map(int, input().split()))
V = list(map(int, input().split()))

def calc_inversion_number(A):
    inversion_number = 0
    for i in range(1, N):
        if A[i] > A[i - 1]:
            inversion_number += 1
    return inversion_number

print(calc_inversion_number(V))
```

**Incorrect use of the `in` operator**

```
N = int(input())
P = list(map(int, input().split()))
V = list(map(int, input().split()))

def is_node_in_list(node, node_list):
    for n in node_list:
        if n == node:
            return True
    return False

print(is_node_in_list(1, P))
```

This implementation of the `is_node_in_list()` function is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the list of nodes is not sorted. This means that the function will return False even if the node is actually in the list.

To fix this problem, the list of nodes should be sorted before the `is_node_in_list()` function is called.

```
N = int(input())
P = list(map(int, input().split()))
V = list(map(int, input().split()))

def is_node_in_list(node, node_list):
    node_list.sort()
    for n in node_list:
        if n == node:
            return True
    return False

print(is_node_in_list(1, P))
```

**Incorrect use of the `min()` function**

**5. Incorrect number of penguins**

The number of penguins should be exactly one. If the number of penguins is not exactly one, the program will crash. For example, if the input data is `3 3 +#+ #P# #P#`, the program will crash.

**6. Incorrect position of penguins**

The penguin should be located on a thin ice. If the penguin is located on an iceberg, the program will crash. For example, if the input data is `3 3 +#+ #P# #+#`, the program will crash.

**7. Incorrect number of edges of penguins**

The penguin should have at least two edges that are not connected to icebergs. If the penguin has less than two edges that are not connected to icebergs, the program will crash. For example, if the input data is `3 3 +#+ #P# #+#`, the program will crash.

**8. Incorrect number of icebergs that need to be smashed**

The number of icebergs that need to be smashed should be greater than or equal to zero. If the number of icebergs that need to be smashed is less than zero, the program will crash.

The program may leak memory. For example, if the program uses a global variable to store the number of pairs of turkeys that are alive after all the men took actions, the program will leak memory.

**5. Race condition**

The program may have a race condition. For example, if two threads are trying to access the same variable at the same time, the program may crash.

**6. Deadlock**

The program may deadlock. For example, if two threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, the program will deadlock.

Title:
ATCODER p03844 AtCoder Beginner Contest 050 - Addition and Subtraction Easy

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input consists of two integers and an operator. If the integers are not converted to the correct data type, the program will not work correctly. For example, if the integers are converted to strings, the program will not be able to perform mathematical operations on them.

**2. Using the wrong operator**

The operator must be either `+` or `-`. If the operator is not correct, the program will not work correctly. For example, if the operator is `*`, the program will not be able to perform addition or subtraction on the integers.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The program must correctly evaluate the formula "A op B". For example, if A is 1 and B is 2, the formula should evaluate to 3. If the logic is incorrect, the program will not produce the correct output.

**4. Not handling errors correctly**

The program should handle errors correctly. For example, if the input is not in the correct format, the program should print an error message and exit. If the program does not handle errors correctly, it may crash or produce incorrect output.

**5. Not using efficient algorithms**

The program should use efficient algorithms to solve the problem. For example, the program should use a binary search to find the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to a given integer. If the program does not use efficient algorithms, it may run slowly or use too much memory.

Title:
ATCODER p04011 AtCoder Beginner Contest 044 - Tak and Hotels (ABC Edit)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input is given in the format of `N K X Y`, where `N`, `K`, `X`, and `Y` are integers. However, if the developer accidentally assigns a string variable to one of these values, the program will not be able to correctly calculate the output.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The total accommodation fee is calculated by multiplying the number of nights by the nightly rate. However, if the developer accidentally multiplies the number of nights by the wrong nightly rate, the program will not be able to correctly calculate the output.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may accidentally count the number of nights incorrectly, which will result in an incorrect calculation of the total accommodation fee.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer representing the total accommodation fee. However, if the developer accidentally outputs multiple values or a string, the program will not be accepted by the judge.

AIZU p00097 Sum of Integers II

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input is "3 6 a", the program may not be able to parse the input correctly and may crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may not be of the correct data type, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input is "3 6.0", the program may not be able to convert the input to an integer and may crash.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The program may incorrectly count the number of combinations, resulting in an incorrect output. For example, if the input is "3 6", the program may incorrectly count the number of combinations as 4, when the correct answer is 3.
4. **Infinite loop**. The program may enter an infinite loop, which will prevent the program from terminating. For example, if the input is "0 0", the program may enter an infinite loop because there are no combinations that sum to 0.
5. **Memory leak**. The program may not release memory that it has allocated, which may eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash. For example, if the program creates a large array of integers and does not release the memory after it is finished using the array, the program may eventually run out of memory and crash.

Pain points:
**1. Input format:**

The input is given in the following format.

```
$W$ $H$
$a_1$ $a_2$ $...$ $a_W$
$b_1$ $b_2$ $...$ $b_H$
```

where

* `$W$` and `$H$` are the number of horizontal and vertical partitions, respectively.
* `$a_i$` and `$b_j$` are the $i$-th and $j$-th members of the first and second number series, respectively.

**2. Output format:**

Output "1" if the information written on the paper is relevant, or "0" otherwise.

**3. Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input format is not correct.
* The number of horizontal and vertical partitions is not within the specified range.
* The values of `$a_i$` and `$b_j$` are not within the specified range.
* The two number series do not match any combination of 5 × 5 matrixes.

**4. Solutions:**

To solve this problem, we can first check the input format. If the input format is not correct, we can raise an error. Otherwise, we can check the number of horizontal and vertical partitions. If the number of horizontal and vertical partitions is not within the specified range, we can raise an error. Otherwise, we can check the values of `$a_i$` and `$b_j$`. If the values of `$a_i$` and `$b_j$` are not within the specified range, we can raise an error. Otherwise, we can check if the two number series match any combination of 5 × 5 matrixes. If the two number series do not match any combination of 5 × 5 matrixes, we can output "0". Otherwise, we can output "1".

AIZU p01455 Intelligible Double Magic

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input format is not very clear. For example, it is not clear what the meaning of "1 + N + i" is.
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if there are multiple ways to construct spell logic. For example, if the spell logic is "A>B>C" and "A>C>B", does that mean that we can use the double magics (A,B), (B,C), and (A,C)?
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if there are no compatible elements. For example, if there are no pairs of elements that are compatible, does that mean that we can use all possible double magics?
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if there are no elements. For example, if there are no elements, does that mean that we can use no double magics?
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if there are no keywords. For example, if there are no keywords, does that mean that we can use no double magics?

**Solutions:**

* The input format can be improved by using a more descriptive name for the "1 + N + i" term. For example, we could call it "the index of the line that contains the pair of compatible elements (pi, qi)".
* The problem statement can be improved by specifying what happens if there are multiple ways to construct spell logic. For example, we could say that the spell logic that allows us to use the most double magics is the correct one.
* The problem statement can be improved by specifying what happens if there are no compatible elements. For example, we could say that we can use no double magics.
* The problem statement can be improved by specifying what happens if there are no elements. For example, we could say that we can use no double magics.

Title:
AIZU p01606 Sliding GCD

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the GCD algorithm.** The GCD algorithm is a well-known and well-tested algorithm, but it is still possible to make mistakes when implementing it. One common mistake is to use the wrong base case. For example, the following code would incorrectly compute the GCD of two numbers:

```
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return gcd(b, a % b)
```

The correct base case is `if a == 0: return b`.

2. **Using an incorrect data structure to store the sliding window.** The sliding window is a data structure that stores a contiguous range of elements from a larger data set. There are many different ways to implement a sliding window, and the choice of data structure can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. One common mistake is to use a list to store the sliding window. Lists are inefficient for storing sliding windows because they require a linear amount of time to insert and delete elements. A more efficient data structure for storing sliding windows is a doubly linked list.

3. **Using an incorrect algorithm to compute the number of distinct GCDs in the sliding window.** There are many different algorithms that can be used to compute the number of distinct GCDs in a sliding window. The choice of algorithm can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. One common mistake is to use a brute-force algorithm. A brute-force algorithm would iterate over all possible GCDs of the elements in the sliding window and count the number of distinct GCDs. This algorithm is very inefficient, as it requires a quadratic amount of time to compute the number of distinct GCDs. A more efficient algorithm is to use a hash table to store the GCDs of the elements in the sliding window. This algorithm requires a linear amount of time to compute the number of distinct GCDs.

4. **Not handling boundary conditions correctly.** The sliding window algorithm has several boundary conditions that need to be handled correctly. One common mistake is to not handle the case where the sliding window is empty. Another common mistake is to not handle the case where the sliding window wraps around the end of the data set.

5. **Not using efficient data structures and algorithms.** The sliding window algorithm can be implemented using a variety of data structures and algorithms. The choice of data structures and algorithms can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. It is important to use efficient data structures and algorithms to ensure that the algorithm runs as fast as possible.

6. **Not testing the algorithm thoroughly.** It is important to test the sliding window algorithm thoroughly before deploying it to production. This includes testing the algorithm on a variety of input data sets and ensuring that the algorithm produces correct results. It is also important to test the algorithm for robustness and to ensure that it does not crash or produce incorrect results under unexpected conditions.

* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correct. For example, the output may not be a list of strings or the strings may not be "Yes" or "No".
* **Incorrect algorithm:** The algorithm may not be correct. For example, the algorithm may not find all of the solutions or it may find incorrect solutions.
* **Incorrect implementation:** The implementation of the algorithm may be incorrect. For example, the implementation may have bugs or it may not be efficient.
* **Incorrect testing:** The testing of the program may be incorrect. For example, the tests may not test all of the possible cases or the tests may not be comprehensive.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to design and implement an efficient algorithm and to test the program thoroughly.

AIZU p02038 Tanuki and Fox

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem states that "you put the animals in a row $P_1, P_2, ..., P_N$ into the device as follows. $M(.... M(M(P_1, P_2), P_3) ...., P_N)$". This means that the animals are put into the device in a **recursive** fashion. So, for example, if $N=3$ and $P_1=T$, $P_2=F$, and $P_3=T$, then the animals would be put into the device in the following order:

```
M(T, F)
M(M(T, F), T)
```

2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for solving this problem is fairly straightforward. However, there are a few details that are important to get right. For example, it is important to make sure that the algorithm correctly handles the case where the input list is empty.

3. **Incorrect testing.** It is important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. This includes testing for all possible input cases, as well as edge cases.

4. **Incorrect debugging.** If your code is not working correctly, it can be difficult to figure out what is wrong. It is important to use a systematic approach to debugging, such as the following:

    1. **Identify the problem.** What is the specific error that is occurring?
    2. **Isolate the problem.** Can you reproduce the error in a small, isolated test case?
    3. **Debug the problem.** Use a debugger to step through your code and identify the source of the error.

5. **Incorrect documentation.** It is important to document your code so that other developers can understand how it works. This includes writing clear comments and providing a docstring for each function.

AIZU p02182 Spot The Difference

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input format specifies that the number of rows N and the number of columns M are integers, but the code below treats them as strings. This will cause an error when the input contains non-integer values.
2. **Incorrect variable initialization**. The code below initializes the variable `diff` to 0, but then it never updates it. This means that the output will always be 0, even if the input contains two boards that are different.
3. **Incorrect comparison**. The code below compares the two boards by using the `==` operator. This operator only works for comparing two equal values, but the two boards may have different lengths. This will cause an error when the two boards are not equal.
4. **Incorrect output**. The code below prints the value of the variable `diff`, but this value is always 0. This is because of the incorrect initialization and comparison errors mentioned above.

To fix these problems, we can do the following:

1. **Correct variable type**. We can change the type of the variables N and M to `int`.
2. **Correct variable initialization**. We can initialize the variable `diff` to the number of rows in the first board.
3. **Correct comparison**. We can compare the two boards by using the `!==` operator. This operator works for comparing two unequal values.
4. **Correct output**. We can print the value of the variable `diff`.

Here is the corrected code:

```
N, M = map(int, input().split())
A = [input() for _ in range(N)]
B = [input() for _ in range(N)]

diff = N
for i in range(N):
    for j in range(M):
        if A[i][j] != B[i][j]:
            diff -= 1

print(diff)

Title:
AIZU p02469 Least Common Multiple

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or the number of integers may not be equal to `n`.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed. For example, the output may not be a single integer, or the integer may not be the least common multiple of the given integers.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the least common multiple**. The least common multiple is not calculated correctly. For example, the least common multiple may be too large or too small.
4. **Incorrect use of data structures**. The data structures used to store the integers may not be appropriate for the problem. For example, using a linked list to store the integers may be inefficient.
5. **Incorrect use of algorithms**. The algorithms used to solve the problem may not be efficient. For example, using a brute-force algorithm to find the least common multiple may be very inefficient.
6. **Incorrect error handling**. The code may not handle errors correctly. For example, the code may not handle the case where the input format is incorrect.
7. **Incorrect testing**. The code may not be tested thoroughly. For example, the code may not be tested with all possible input values.
