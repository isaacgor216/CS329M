Title:
CODECHEF promo

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The variable `N` should be of type `int`, but it is of type `string`. This will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect operator:** The operator `%` is used to perform modulus division, but it is used to perform addition in the following line of code: `ans = N + (X - Y) % 60`. This will cause the program to output incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect logic:** The following line of code is incorrect: `if (ans < 0)`. The variable `ans` should be greater than or equal to 0, so this line of code will always be true.
4. **Uninitialized variable:** The variable `ans` is not initialized before it is used in the following line of code: `ans = N + (X - Y) % 60`. This will cause the program to crash.
5. **Off-by-one error:** The following line of code is incorrect: `ans = N + (X - Y) % 60`. The correct code should be `ans = N + (X - Y + 60) % 60`. This will cause the program to output incorrect results.

To fix these problems, we can do the following:

1. Change the variable type of `N` to `int`.
2. Change the operator `%` to `+`.
3. Correct the logic in the following line of code: `if (ans < 0)`.
4. Initialize the variable `ans` to 0.
5. Correct the off-by-one error in the following line of code: `ans = N + (X - Y) % 60`.

Title:
CODECHEF tech04

Pain points:
**1. The input strings may not be of the same length.** The code should check if the lengths of the two strings are equal before proceeding to compare the characters.

**2. The input strings may contain characters other than letters.** The code should only compare characters in the range 'a'-'z'.

**3. The code may not correctly handle anagrams that are formed by using different cases for the same letter.** For example, the strings "aAbA" and "aBaA" are anagrams, but the code may not correctly identify them as such if it is not case-sensitive.

**4. The code may not correctly handle anagrams that are formed by using numbers or symbols.** For example, the strings "123" and "321" are anagrams, but the code may not correctly identify them as such if it is not alphanumeric.

**5. The code may not correctly handle anagrams that are formed by using spaces or other punctuation marks.** For example, the strings "a b c" and "c b a" are anagrams, but the code may not correctly identify them as such if it is not whitespace-sensitive.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1333_F. Kate and imperfection

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specified in the problem statement is "The first and only line in the input consists of only one integer n (2≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5) — the size of the given set S.". If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to read the input correctly and will produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specified in the problem statement is "Output contains only one line that includes n - 1 integers: I_2, I_3, ..., I_n.". If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will receive a incorrect verdict.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a bug in the algorithm, or using an incorrect data structure. If the algorithm is incorrect, the program will not be able to find the correct answer and will receive a incorrect verdict.
4. **Runtime error**. The program may run into a runtime error. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a division by zero error, or an array out-of-bounds error. If the program encounters a runtime error, it will be terminated and will receive a incorrect verdict.
5. **Memory error**. The program may run out of memory. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as allocating too much memory, or not freeing memory that is no longer needed. If the program runs out of memory, it will be terminated and will receive a incorrect verdict.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the program thoroughly with a variety of input values to ensure that it is correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1374_A. Required Remainder

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**

The modulo operator (%) in most programming languages returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second. However, in this problem, we need to find the largest integer k such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n and k mod x = y. This means that we need to find the largest integer k such that k - y is divisible by x. To do this, we can use the following formula:

```
k = (n + y) // x
```

**2. Not handling the case where y is negative**

In the problem statement, it is specified that 0 ≤ y < x. However, it is possible for y to be negative. In this case, we can simply add x to y to get a positive number. Then, we can use the formula above to find the largest integer k such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n and k mod x = y + x.

**3. Not handling the case where n is greater than x**

In the problem statement, it is specified that y ≤ n. However, it is possible for n to be greater than x. In this case, we can simply use the formula above to find the largest integer k such that 0 ≤ k ≤ x and k mod x = y.

**4. Using an incorrect data type**

The problem statement specifies that x, y, and n can be up to 10^9 in magnitude. However, some programming languages have a limit on the size of integers that can be represented. If you use an incorrect data type, you may get an overflow error.

**5. Not using a fast algorithm**

The naive algorithm for solving this problem takes O(n) time. However, it is possible to solve the problem in O(1) time using the following formula:

```
k = (n + y) // x
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 1397_B. Power Sequence

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the binary search algorithm.** The binary search algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that can be used to find the position of a target value in a sorted array. However, if the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results. For example, the following implementation of the binary search algorithm will not work correctly:

```
def binary_search(array, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(array) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if array[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif array[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

The problem with this implementation is that it does not check if the left and right pointers have crossed. This can lead to incorrect results if the target value is not in the array.

2. **Using the wrong data type for the input values.** The input values in this problem are positive integers. However, if the developer uses the wrong data type for the input values, it can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the developer uses the `int` data type for the input values, it is possible that the values will overflow. This can lead to incorrect results, such as the following:

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# This code will incorrectly calculate the minimum cost to transform the list into a power sequence.
cost = 0
for i in range(n):
    cost += abs(a[i] - a[i - 1])

print(cost)
```

The correct way to solve this problem is to use the `long` data type for the input values. This will prevent the values from overflowing and will ensure that the correct results are calculated.

3. **Not handling the edge cases correctly.** This problem has a few edge cases that the developer needs to handle correctly. For example, the input list may be empty, or it may contain only one element. If the developer does not handle these edge cases correctly, it can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Using inefficient algorithms.** There are a number of different ways to solve this problem. However, some algorithms are more efficient than others. The developer should choose the most efficient algorithm for the problem.

5. **Not using a test suite.** A test suite is a set of tests that can be used to verify that the code is working correctly. The developer should create a test suite for this problem and run it regularly to ensure that the code is still working correctly.

6. **Not commenting the code.** The developer should comment the code to make it easier to understand. This will help other developers to understand the code and to debug it if necessary.

7. **Not following the style guide.** The developer should follow the style guide for the programming language that they are using. This will make the code easier to read and maintain.

8. **Not using version control.** The developer should use version control to track changes to the code. This will help to keep track of changes and to roll back changes if necessary.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very clear. It is not clear what the format of the first line of each test case should be. For example, is it `n m k` or `n,m,k`? Is there a space between the numbers? If there is a space, how many spaces?

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also not very clear. It is not clear what the format of the first line of each output should be. For example, is it `1` or `1\n`? Is there a space between the numbers? If there is a space, how many spaces?

**3. Incorrect data type**

The problem statement does not specify the data type of the input and output. This can lead to errors if the developer does not use the correct data type. For example, if the developer uses `int` for the input and output, they may get incorrect results if the input or output contains a value that is too large for an `int`.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

The problem statement is not very clear about the boundary conditions. For example, it is not clear whether the graph is allowed to have self-loops or multiple edges. This can lead to off-by-one errors if the developer does not handle these cases correctly.

**5. Undefined behavior**

The problem statement does not specify what should happen if the graph is not connected. This can lead to undefined behavior if the developer does not handle this case correctly.

**6. Memory leaks**

The problem statement does not specify how the developer should free the memory that they allocate. This can lead to memory leaks if the developer does not free the memory correctly.

CODEFORCES 25_C. Roads in Berland

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly. For example, if you forget to read the number of cities, you will get an incorrect answer.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of this problem is also very specific. You need to make sure that you are outputting the correct number of values, and that the values are separated by spaces. For example, if you output the values in the wrong order, or if you forget to put spaces between them, you will get an incorrect answer.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the shortest distances**

The shortest distance between two cities is the minimum of the distances between them along all possible paths. It is important to make sure that you are correctly calculating the shortest distances between all pairs of cities. For example, if you forget to consider all possible paths, or if you calculate the distances incorrectly, you will get an incorrect answer.

**4. Incorrect calculation of the sum of the shortest distances**

The sum of the shortest distances between all pairs of cities is the sum of the shortest distances between each pair of cities. It is important to make sure that you are correctly calculating the sum of the shortest distances. For example, if you forget to add up the distances between all pairs of cities, or if you calculate the distances incorrectly, you will get an incorrect answer.

**5. Incorrect handling of duplicate roads**

The problem states that there can be several roads between a pair of cities. However, the sum of the shortest distances between a pair of cities should only be counted once, even if there are multiple roads between them. It is important to make sure that you are correctly handling duplicate roads. For example, if you add up the distances between a pair of cities multiple times, you will get an incorrect answer.

CODEFORCES 331_D1. Escaping on Beaveractor

Pain points:
```
### Possible problems and bugs:

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when writing it. For example, you might forget to include a space between two numbers, or you might use the wrong characters to represent the directions. If you make a mistake in the input format, the program will not be able to run correctly.
2. **Incorrect logic.** The logic for this problem is fairly complex, and it's easy to make a mistake when writing it. For example, you might forget to check for certain conditions, or you might use the wrong variables. If you make a mistake in the logic, the program will not be able to produce the correct output.
3. **Incorrect implementation.** Even if you get the input format and logic correct, you still need to implement the program correctly. This means using the right data structures and algorithms, and writing your code in a clear and efficient way. If you make a mistake in the implementation, the program will not be able to run correctly.

Here are some specific examples of problems and bugs that you might encounter when solving this problem:

* You might forget to include a space between two numbers in the input format. For example, you might write `123456` instead of `1234 56`. This will cause the program to read the input incorrectly.
* You might forget to check for certain conditions in the logic. For example, you might not check if the Beaveractor has reached the edge of the campus. This could cause the program to output incorrect results.
* You might use the wrong variables in the logic. For example, you might use `x` to represent the Beaveractor's y-coordinate. This will cause the program to produce incorrect results.
* You might not implement the program correctly. For example, you might use a data structure that is not appropriate for the problem. This could cause the program to run slowly or crash.

By following these tips, you can avoid many of the common problems and bugs that developers encounter when solving this problem.

# 331_D1. Escaping on Beaveractor

## Problem spec

Don't put up with what you're sick of! The Smart Beaver decided to escape from the campus of Beaver Science Academy (BSA). BSA is a b × b square on a plane. Each point x, y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ b) belongs to BSA. To make the path quick and funny, the Beaver constructed a Beaveractor, an effective and comfortable types of transport.

The campus obeys traffic rules: there are n arrows, parallel to the coordinate axes. The arrows do not intersect and do not touch each other. When the Beaveractor reaches some arrow, it turns in the arrow's direction and moves on until it either reaches the next arrow or gets outside the campus. The Beaveractor covers exactly one unit of space per one unit of time. You can assume that there are no obstacles to the Beaveractor.

The BSA scientists want to transport the brand new Beaveractor to the "Academic Tractor" research institute and send the Smart Beaver to do his postgraduate studies and sharpen pencils. They have q plans, representing the Beaveractor's initial position (xi, yi), the initial motion vector wi and the time ti that have passed after the escape started.

Your task is for each of the q plans to determine the Smart Beaver's position after the given time.

## Input

The first line contains two integers: the number of traffic rules n and the size of the campus b, 0 ≤ n, 1 ≤ b. Next n lines contain the rules. Each line of the rules contains four space-separated integers x0, y0, x1, y1 — the beginning and the end of the arrow. It is guaranteed that all arrows are parallel to the coordinate axes and have no common points. All arrows are located inside the campus, that is, 0 ≤ x0, y0, x1, y1 ≤ b holds.

Next line contains integer q — the number of plans the scientists have, 1 ≤ q ≤ 105. The i-th plan is represented by two integers, xi, yi are the Beaveractor's coordinates at the initial time, 0 ≤ xi, yi ≤ b, character wi, that takes value U, D, L, R and sets the initial direction up, down, to the left or to the right correspondingly (the Y axis is directed upwards), and ti — the time passed after the escape started, 0 ≤ ti ≤ 1015.

## Output

Print q lines. Each line should contain two integers — the Beaveractor's coordinates at the final moment of time for each plan. If the Smart Beaver manages to leave the campus in time ti, print the coordinates of the last point in the campus he visited.

Title:
CODEFORCES 39_D. Cubical Planet

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be in the format `x y z`, where `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers between 0 and 1. If the input is not in this format, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be `YES` or `NO`. If the output is not in this format, the program will get a Wrong Answer verdict.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When checking whether the flies see each other, it is important to make sure that you are comparing the correct coordinates. For example, if the first fly is at `(0, 0, 0)` and the second fly is at `(1, 1, 1)`, you need to check if `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2` and `z1 == z2`. If you accidentally compare `x1 == x2 + 1` or `y1 == y2 + 1`, the program will give the wrong answer.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The logic for checking whether the flies see each other is relatively simple, but it is still possible to make mistakes. For example, you might forget to check if the flies are on the same face of the cube, or you might incorrectly calculate the distance between the flies.
5. **Runtime errors**. The program should run in a reasonable amount of time, even for large inputs. If the program takes too long to run, it will get a Time Limit Exceeded verdict.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand the problem. You should also test your program on a variety of inputs to make sure that it is working correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 470_B. Hexakosioihexekontahexaphobia

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly checking for substrings.** The most common mistake is to check for substrings incorrectly. For example, the following code would incorrectly check for the substring "666" in the string "16660":

```
if "666" in "16660":
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

This code would output "YES" even though the substring "666" is not present in the string "16660". To correctly check for substrings, you need to use the `find()` method. The `find()` method takes a substring as its argument and returns the index of the first occurrence of that substring in the string. If the substring is not found, the `find()` method returns -1.

```
if "666" in "16660":
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

2. **Using the wrong data type.** Another common mistake is to use the wrong data type. For example, the following code would incorrectly check for the substring "666" in the string "16660":

```
if "666" == "16660":
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

This code would output "YES" even though the substring "666" is not present in the string "16660". To correctly check for substrings, you need to use the `find()` method, which takes a string as its argument.

```
if "666" in "16660":
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

3. **Not handling edge cases.** Another common mistake is to not handle edge cases. For example, the following code would incorrectly check for the substring "666" in the empty string:

```
if "666" in "":
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

This code would output "YES" even though the substring "666" is not present in the empty string. To correctly check for substrings, you need to handle edge cases such as the empty string.

CODEFORCES 592_D. Super M

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**

The input format is `n m` followed by `n - 1` lines of `ui vi` and `m` lines of `ci`. However, the input may not be in this format. For example, the input may be `n m` followed by `m` lines of `ci`. In this case, the program will not be able to process the input correctly and will give a wrong answer.

**2. The road network is not connected**

The road network must be connected, meaning that there must be a path from any city to any other city. If the road network is not connected, the program will not be able to find a path from the teleportation city to all the attacked cities and will give a wrong answer.

**3. The attacked cities are not reachable from the teleportation city**

The attacked cities must be reachable from the teleportation city. If the attacked cities are not reachable from the teleportation city, the program will not be able to scare all the humans in the attacked cities and will give a wrong answer.

**4. The teleportation city is not in the road network**

The teleportation city must be in the road network. If the teleportation city is not in the road network, the program will not be able to teleport to the teleportation city and will give a wrong answer.

**5. The teleportation city is not attacked**

The teleportation city must not be attacked. If the teleportation city is attacked, the program will not be able to scare the humans in the teleportation city and will give a wrong answer.

**6. The minimum time is not unique**

The minimum time to scare all the humans in the attacked cities may not be unique. In this case, the program must print the teleportation city with the smallest city number.

**7. The output format is not correct**

The output format is `c t`, where `c` is the teleportation city and `t` is the minimum time. However, the output may not be in this format. For example, the output may be `c` or `t`. In this case, the program will not be able to output the correct answer.

Title:
CODEFORCES 614_B. Gena's Code

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format specified in the problem statement is:

```
The first line of the input contains the number of countries n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000). The second line contains n non-negative integers ai without leading zeroes — the number of tanks of the i-th country.
```

A developer may incorrectly parse the input format and read the number of countries as a string, or read the number of tanks as a negative number. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

### 2. Incorrect calculation of the product

The product of the number of tanks from each country can be calculated as follows:

```
product = a1 * a2 * ... * an
```

A developer may incorrectly calculate the product by multiplying the numbers in the wrong order, or by using an incorrect data type for the product. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

### 3. Overflow

The product of the number of tanks from each country can be very large. If the product is not stored in a large enough data type, it may overflow and cause the program to crash.

### 4. Undefined behavior

The problem statement does not specify what to do if the number of tanks from a country is not beautiful. A developer may incorrectly assume that the product of the number of tanks from each country is always defined, even if one of the numbers is not beautiful. This would cause the program to produce incorrect output.

### 5. Security vulnerabilities

The program may be vulnerable to a variety of security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and SQL injection attacks. A developer must take care to secure the program against these vulnerabilities.
Test inputs:
**1. Incorrect input format**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

This code will incorrectly parse the input format and read the number of countries as a string.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the product**

```
product = 1
for i in range(n):
    product *= a[i]
```

This code will incorrectly calculate the product by multiplying the numbers in the wrong order.

**3. Overflow**

```
product = 1
for i in range(n):
    product *= a[i]
print(product)
```

This code will overflow if the product of the number of tanks from each country is very large.

**4. Undefined behavior**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
product = 1
for i in range(n):
    product *= a[i]
print(product)
```

This code will incorrectly produce output if the number of tanks from a country is not beautiful.

**5. Security vulnerabilities**

The program below is vulnerable to a variety of security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and SQL injection attacks.

```
import sys

def main():
    n = int(input())
    a = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    print(a)

if __name__ == "__main__":

Title:
CODEFORCES 633_G. Yash And Trees

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the segment tree.** The segment tree is a data structure that can be used to answer range queries on a given array. However, if the implementation of the segment tree is incorrect, it may not be able to answer queries correctly. For example, if the segment tree is not initialized correctly, it may not be able to answer queries on the first few elements of the array.
2. **Incorrect use of the segment tree.** The segment tree can be used to answer a variety of range queries, but it is important to use the segment tree correctly for each type of query. For example, if you are trying to answer a query on the sum of the elements in a range, you need to use the segment tree's `sum` function. If you use the wrong function, the segment tree may not be able to answer the query correctly.
3. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The segment tree can be used to store integers of any size. However, if the integers are too large, they may overflow when they are added to the segment tree. This can cause the segment tree to become corrupted and unable to answer queries correctly.
4. **Incorrect handling of duplicate elements.** The segment tree can be used to store duplicate elements. However, if the duplicate elements are not handled correctly, the segment tree may not be able to answer queries correctly. For example, if the segment tree is used to store the sum of the elements in a range, and the range contains duplicate elements, the segment tree may not be able to correctly calculate the sum of the elements in the range.
5. **Incorrect handling of boundary conditions.** The segment tree can be used to answer queries on a range of elements. However, if the range of elements is not handled correctly, the segment tree may not be able to answer queries correctly. For example, if the range of elements includes the first element of the array, the segment tree may not be able to answer queries on the first element of the array.

CODEFORCES 662_B. Graph Coloring

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not followed correctly, which may cause the program to crash or output incorrect results. For example, if the input contains an incorrect number of vertices or edges, or if the edges are not described correctly, the program may not be able to process the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program may be incorrect, which may cause the program to output incorrect results or crash. For example, if the program does not correctly account for all possible cases, it may output incorrect results. Or, if the program uses incorrect data structures or algorithms, it may crash.
3. **Incorrect implementation.** The program may be incorrectly implemented, which may cause the program to crash or output incorrect results. For example, if the program uses incorrect variable names or data types, it may not be able to process the input correctly. Or, if the program contains syntax errors, it may crash.
4. **Incorrect testing.** The program may not be adequately tested, which may cause the program to output incorrect results or crash. For example, if the program is not tested with a variety of input data, it may not be able to handle all possible cases correctly. Or, if the program is not tested with edge cases, it may crash.
5. **Incorrect debugging.** The program may not be debugged correctly, which may cause the program to output incorrect results or crash. For example, if the program is not debugged with a debugger, it may be difficult to find and fix errors. Or, if the program is not debugged with a variety of input data, it may not be able to handle all possible cases correctly.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully follow the input format, use correct logic, implement the program correctly, test the program thoroughly, and debug the program correctly.

CODEFORCES 686_E. Optimal Point

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is a list of integers, but the code is expecting a list of strings. This can be fixed by changing the type of the input variable to `list(map(int, input().split()))`.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The code is computing the maximum Manhattan distance incorrectly. The correct formula is `max(abs(x1 - x2), abs(y1 - y2), abs(z1 - z2))`, but the code is using `max(x1 - x2, y1 - y2, z1 - z2)`. This can be fixed by changing the `max()` function to `max(abs(x1 - x2), abs(y1 - y2), abs(z1 - z2))`.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code is not taking into account the case where all of the roses are in the same location. In this case, the optimal point is the same as any of the roses. This can be fixed by adding a check to see if all of the roses are in the same location. If they are, then the optimal point is the same as any of the roses.
4. **Uncaught exception**. The code is not handling the case where the input data is invalid. This can be fixed by adding a try-catch block to catch any exceptions that are raised.
5. **Inefficient algorithm**. The code is using a brute-force algorithm to find the optimal point. This algorithm is very inefficient and will not work for large datasets. A more efficient algorithm would be to use a divide-and-conquer approach.

CODEFORCES 709_D. Recover the String

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be a line of four integers, each separated by a single space. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to parse the input and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single line of text, containing the string that matches the given four integers. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will likely receive a incorrect answer.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When computing the number of subsequences of length 2, it is important to make sure that you are not counting the same subsequence twice. This can be a common mistake, and can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The logic used to find the string that matches the given four integers must be correct. If the logic is incorrect, the program will not be able to find the correct answer.
5. **Memory errors**. If the program does not allocate enough memory, it will likely crash. This can happen if the input is very large, or if the program uses a lot of memory for other purposes.
6. **Timeout errors**. If the program takes too long to run, it will likely receive a timeout error. This can happen if the input is very large, or if the program is inefficient.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correctly parsed. For example, if the input is `3 21 12 75 52`, the program will throw an error because the second line is not a valid integer sequence.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not always correctly parsed. For example, if the output is `110 2 5 22`, the program will throw an error because the second line is not a valid integer sequence.

**3. Incorrect calculation**

The program may incorrectly calculate the minimum number of burles to pay for all receipts. For example, if the input is `3 21 12 75 52`, the program may incorrectly calculate the minimum number of burles to be `111` instead of `110`.

**4. Incorrect use of bonuses**

The program may incorrectly use bonuses. For example, if the input is `3 21 12 75 52`, the program may incorrectly use `28` bonuses on the first day, even though the maximum number of bonuses that can be used on a single day is `10`.

**5. Other bugs**

There may be other bugs in the program that are not listed here. For example, the program may crash or hang.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not correctly followed. For example, the output may not contain the correct number of lines, or the values in the output may not be integers.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the logic may not correctly check if the sum of elements in each new array is not zero, or the logic may not correctly check if the new arrays are placed one after another.

**4. Runtime errors**

The code may contain runtime errors, such as division by zero or accessing an array element out of bounds.

**5. Memory errors**

The code may allocate too much memory, which can lead to a segmentation fault or other problems.

Title:
CODEFORCES 774_J. Stepan's Series

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains two integers n and k, which represent the number of episodes in the series and the dissatisfaction which should be checked. The second line contains the sequence which consists of n symbols "Y", "N" and "?". If the i-th symbol equals "Y", Stepan remembers that he has watched the episode number i. If the i-th symbol equals "N", Stepan remembers that he hasn't watched the epizode number i. If the i-th symbol equals "?", Stepan doesn't exactly remember if he has watched the episode number i or not.

If we use the wrong data type to store n and k, we may get incorrect results. For example, if we use int to store n and k, we may get incorrect results when n and k are large.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The correct algorithm for solving this problem is to iterate over the sequence of symbols and keep track of the maximum number of consecutive episodes that Stepan did not watch. If this maximum number is equal to k, then we print "YES", otherwise we print "NO".

If we use the wrong algorithm, we may get incorrect results. For example, if we use a brute-force algorithm, we may get incorrect results when the sequence of symbols is long.

**3. Not handling edge cases correctly**

There are a few edge cases that we need to handle correctly when solving this problem. For example, we need to handle the case when n is 0 or k is 0. We also need to handle the case when the sequence of symbols is empty.

If we do not handle these edge cases correctly, we may get incorrect results.

The output for this problem should be a single integer, representing the maximum possible total happiness that can be achieved. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly output the results and will receive a compilation error.

**3. Insufficient memory**

If the program does not allocate enough memory to store the input data, it will crash. This can happen if the input data is very large, or if the program is not using an efficient memory management strategy.

**4. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve this problem must be correct in order to produce the correct output. If the algorithm is incorrect, the program will output incorrect results.

**5. Runtime errors**

The program may encounter runtime errors if it is not properly designed or implemented. These errors can include things like division by zero, invalid array accesses, and out-of-bounds memory accesses.

**6. Logic errors**

The program may contain logic errors that cause it to produce incorrect results. These errors can be difficult to find and fix, so it is important to carefully test the program before deploying it to production.

**7. User errors**

The user may provide incorrect input data, which can cause the program to produce incorrect results. It is important to provide clear and concise instructions on how to use the program, and to test the program with a variety of different input data sets.
Test inputs:
### Incorrect input format

1. ```
3 12
3 5 7
4 6 7
5 9 5
```

This input is incorrect because it does not have the correct format. The first line should contain the number of contestants (N) and the number of slices per pizza (S). The following lines should contain the number of slices each contestant will eat, the happiness they will gain from each type 1 slice they eat, and the happiness they will gain from each type 2 slice they eat.

2. ```
1000000000 1
```

This input is incorrect because the number of contestants (N) is too large. The maximum value for N is 105.

3. ```
1 10
-1 5 7
```

This input is incorrect because the number of slices the contestant will eat (si) is negative. The value of si must be non-negative.

4. ```
1 10
1 5 7
2 6 7
```

This input is incorrect because the number of slices the contestant will eat (si) is greater than the number of slices per pizza (S). The value of si must be less than or equal to S.

### Incorrect output format

1. ```
84
```

This output is incorrect because it does not have the correct format. The output should be a single integer, representing the maximum possible total happiness that can be achieved.

2. ```
84.0
```

This output is incorrect because it is a floating-point number. The output should be an integer.

### Insufficient memory

1. ```
1000000000 1
```

This input is too large for the program to handle. The program will crash when it tries to allocate memory for the input data.

2. ```
1000000000 1000000000
```

This input is too large for the program to handle. The program will crash when it tries to allocate memory for the input data.

### Incorrect algorithm

1. ```
n, s = map(int, input().split())
a, b = [], []
for _ in range(n):
    s, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    a.append(a)
    b.append(b)

max_a = sum(a)
max_b = sum(b)
ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    ans = max(ans, max_a - a[i] + b[i], max_b - b[i] + a[i])

print(ans)
```

This algorithm is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the number of slices per pizza is limited. The program will output the maximum possible total happiness that can be achieved if the number of slices per pizza is unlimited, which is not the correct answer.

2. ```
n, s = map(int, input().split())
a, b = [], []
for _ in range(n):
    s, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    a.append(a)
    b.append(b)

max_a = max(a)
max_b = max(b)
ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    ans = max(ans, max_a - a[i] + b[i], max_b - b[i] + a[i])

print(ans)
```

This algorithm is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the number of slices per pizza is limited. The program will output the maximum possible total happiness that can be achieved if the number of slices per pizza is unlimited, which is not the correct answer.

### Runtime errors

1. ```
n, s = map(int, input().split())
a, b = [], []
for _ in range(n):
    s, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    a.append(a)
    b.append(b)

max_a = sum(a)
max_b = sum(b)
ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    ans = max(ans, max_a - a[i] + b[i], max_b - b[i] + a[i])

print(ans)
```

CODEFORCES 892_E. Envy

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the MST algorithm**

The MST algorithm is a well-known and well-studied algorithm, but it is still possible to make mistakes when implementing it. Some common mistakes include:

* Using an incorrect data structure to represent the graph.
* Not handling duplicate edges correctly.
* Not handling negative edge weights correctly.
* Not terminating the algorithm early when a MST has been found.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the query processing algorithm**

The query processing algorithm is also relatively straightforward, but it is still possible to make mistakes. Some common mistakes include:

* Not handling queries with duplicate edges correctly.
* Not handling queries with negative edge weights correctly.
* Not terminating the algorithm early when a MST containing all of the query edges has been found.

**3. Incorrect handling of input errors**

The input to this problem is not guaranteed to be correct. It is possible that the input contains invalid values, such as negative edge weights or duplicate edges. It is important to handle these errors correctly, and to not crash the program.

**4. Incorrect output formatting**

The output for this problem must be in a specific format. It is important to make sure that the output is formatted correctly, or the solution will be incorrect.

**5. Runtime errors**

The MST algorithm can be implemented in a variety of ways, and some implementations are more efficient than others. It is important to choose an efficient implementation, or the solution will run too slowly.

**6. Memory errors**

The MST algorithm can be implemented in a variety of ways, and some implementations are more memory-intensive than others. It is important to choose an implementation that is memory-efficient, or the solution will run out of memory.

CODEFORCES 914_E. Palindromes in a Tree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is a tree, which is a connected acyclic undirected graph. A graph is represented by a list of edges. Each edge is represented by a pair of vertices. So the input data should be a list of lists of integers. However, the developer may mistakenly assume that the input data is a list of integers, and then try to parse the data as a list of integers. This will cause a `ValueError`.

**2. Incorrect graph construction**

Once the input data is parsed correctly, the developer needs to construct the graph. The developer may mistakenly create a directed graph instead of an undirected graph. This will cause the algorithm to give incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect traversal of the graph**

The algorithm to find all palindromic paths in a tree is to traverse the tree in a depth-first manner. The developer may mistakenly traverse the tree in a breadth-first manner. This will cause the algorithm to miss some palindromic paths.

**4. Incorrect calculation of palindromic paths**

The algorithm to calculate the number of palindromic paths passing through a vertex is to consider all possible permutations of the labels of the vertices in the path. The developer may mistakenly only consider a subset of all possible permutations. This will cause the algorithm to give incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect output**

The output of the algorithm should be a list of integers, where the i-th element is the number of palindromic paths passing through vertex i. The developer may mistakenly output a list of strings, or a list of lists of integers. This will cause the output to be incorrect.

CODEFORCES 937_C. Save Energy!

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a non-integer value, or it may not contain three integers separated by spaces.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may not be a single number, or it may not be rounded to the nearest 10-9.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the total time it takes to cook the chicken. For example, the developer may not account for the fact that the chicken is cooked at a different rate when the stove is turned on and off.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may make an off-by-one error when calculating the total time it takes to cook the chicken. For example, the developer may forget to add one to the total time when the chicken is cooked for a full minute on the turned-off stove.
5. **Floating-point rounding error**. The developer may incorrectly round the total time it takes to cook the chicken to the nearest 10-9. This can happen if the total time is very close to a multiple of 10-9.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that they understand the input format and output format. They should also carefully check their calculations to make sure that they are correct. Finally, they should be aware of the possibility of floating-point rounding errors and take steps to minimize them.

CODEFORCES 962_E. Byteland, Berland and Disputed Cities

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type for input**. The input is a list of integers and strings, but the code is expecting a list of integers. This can be fixed by changing the type of the input variable to `list`.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator**. The code is comparing the city types using the `==` operator, but this is not correct. The correct operator to use is `is`.
3. **Incorrect use of the `min()` function**. The code is using the `min()` function to find the minimum distance between two cities, but this is not correct. The correct way to do this is to use the `heapq` module.
4. **Incorrect use of the `bisect()` function**. The code is using the `bisect()` function to find the index of a city in a list, but this is not correct. The correct way to do this is to use the `bisect_left()` function.
5. **Incorrect use of the `itertools` module**. The code is using the `itertools` module to iterate over a list of cities, but this is not correct. The correct way to do this is to use the `enumerate()` function.
6. **Incorrect use of the `collections` module**. The code is using the `collections` module to create a set of cities, but this is not correct. The correct way to do this is to use the `set()` function.
7. **Incorrect use of the `math` module**. The code is using the `math` module to calculate the distance between two cities, but this is not correct. The correct way to do this is to use the `hypot()` function.
8. **Incorrect use of the `sys` module**. The code is using the `sys` module to exit the program, but this is not correct. The correct way to do this is to use the `exit()` function.
9. **Incorrect use of the `time` module**. The code is using the `time` module to measure the execution time of the program, but this is not correct. The correct way to do this is to use the `timeit` module.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may contain a number that is not an integer.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the minimum amount of burles that the organizers need to pay. For example, the developer may forget to take into account the cost of demolishing boxes.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may make an off-by-one error when calculating the number of boxes that need to be built or demolished. For example, the developer may calculate the number of boxes that need to be built as n - m instead of n % m.
5. **Infinite loop**. The developer may write a program that enters an infinite loop. This can happen if the program is not properly terminated or if the program contains a logic error.
6. **Memory leak**. The developer may write a program that leaks memory. This can happen if the program does not properly free memory that is no longer needed.
7. **Security vulnerability**. The developer may write a program that contains a security vulnerability. This can happen if the program allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.

Title:
HACKEREARTH ankit-and-numbers-8

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the power set algorithm.** The power set of a set S is the set of all subsets of S. A subset of S is a set of elements of S, where each element is either in the subset or not. The power set of S can be constructed recursively by taking each element of S and creating all possible subsets of S that include that element. For example, the power set of the set {1, 2, 3} is {{1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the sum of all elements in the power set.** The sum of all elements in the power set of a set S is equal to 2^n, where n is the number of elements in S. For example, the sum of all elements in the power set of the set {1, 2, 3} is 2^3 = 8.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the sum of all elements in the power set, it is important to make sure that you include all of the elements. For example, if you are calculating the sum of all elements in the power set of the set {1, 2, 3}, you must include the element 1, even though it is the only element in the set.
4. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The power set of a set can be represented using a variety of data structures, such as a set, a list, or a hash table. When choosing a data structure to represent the power set, it is important to make sure that the data structure is able to efficiently store and access the elements of the power set.
5. **Memory leaks.** When creating the power set of a set, it is important to make sure that you do not create any memory leaks. A memory leak occurs when a piece of memory is allocated but never freed. Memory leaks can eventually lead to a program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Incorrect handling of errors.** When calculating the sum of all elements in the power set, it is important to make sure that you handle errors correctly. For example, if you are trying to calculate the sum of all elements in the power set of a set that does not exist, you should throw an exception.
7. **Inefficient algorithms.** There are a variety of algorithms that can be used to calculate the sum of all elements in the power set of a set. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. When choosing an algorithm to calculate the sum of all elements in the power set, it is important to make sure that the algorithm is efficient.
8. **Unclear code.** When writing code to calculate the sum of all elements in the power set, it is important to make sure that the code is clear and easy to understand. Unclear code can make it difficult for other developers to understand what the code is doing, which can lead to errors.

**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type:** The data may be of the wrong type. For example, the input may contain strings when the program expects numbers, or vice versa. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors:** Off-by-one errors occur when the programmer makes a mistake in the calculation of an index or a pointer. This can cause the program to access invalid memory or skip over data.
4. **Infinite loops:** Infinite loops occur when the program enters a loop that never terminates. This can happen if the programmer makes a mistake in the loop condition or if the loop body does not contain any statements that change the loop condition.
5. **Memory leaks:** Memory leaks occur when the programmer allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions:** Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
7. **Deadlocks:** Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can eventually lead to the program running out of resources and crashing.
8. **Security vulnerabilities:** Security vulnerabilities can occur when the programmer makes mistakes in the implementation of security features. This can allow attackers to gain access to sensitive data or take control of the program.

**How to avoid these problems:**

1. **Use a proper input validation library:** A good input validation library will check the input format and data type and throw an error if there is a problem. This will help to prevent the program from crashing or producing incorrect output.
2. **Use the correct data types:** Always use the correct data types for the data that you are storing. This will help to prevent off-by-one errors and other problems.
3. **Check your calculations:** Make sure that you check your calculations carefully to avoid off-by-one errors.
4. **Use break statements to exit loops:** Use break statements to exit loops when the loop condition is met. This will help to prevent infinite loops.
5. **Free memory when you are done with it:** Always free memory when you are done with it. This will help to prevent memory leaks.
6. **Use synchronization to avoid race conditions:** Use synchronization to ensure that only one thread can access a resource at a time. This will help to prevent race conditions.
7. **Avoid deadlocks:** Avoid deadlocks by making sure that each thread releases all of the resources that it has acquired before it tries to acquire new resources.
8. **Implement security features correctly:** Make sure that you implement security features correctly. This will help to prevent security vulnerabilities.

HACKEREARTH plane-with-points

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrectly identifying collinear points**. If two points are not collinear, they cannot be removed in the same turn. A developer may incorrectly identify two points as collinear when they are not, resulting in an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrectly counting the number of ways to remove the points**. The number of ways to remove the points depends on the order in which they are removed. A developer may incorrectly count the number of ways to remove the points, resulting in an incorrect answer.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm**. There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. A developer may use an incorrect algorithm, resulting in an incorrect answer.
4. **Using incorrect data types**. The data types used to represent the points and the number of turns must be large enough to avoid overflow errors. A developer may use incorrect data types, resulting in an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrectly handling special cases**. There are a few special cases that a developer must handle correctly in order to get the correct answer. For example, if all of the points are collinear, the minimum number of turns is 1. A developer who does not handle this case correctly will get an incorrect answer.

**Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:**

1. **Use a robust algorithm to identify collinear points**. There are many different algorithms that can be used to identify collinear points. A robust algorithm will be able to correctly identify collinear points even if they are close together or if they are not perfectly aligned.
2. **Carefully count the number of ways to remove the points**. The number of ways to remove the points depends on the order in which they are removed. A developer should carefully count the number of ways to remove the points, making sure to account for all possible orders.
3. **Use the correct data types**. The data types used to represent the points and the number of turns must be large enough to avoid overflow errors. A developer should use the correct data types, making sure that they are large enough to represent the largest possible values.
4. **Handle special cases correctly**. There are a few special cases that a developer must handle correctly in order to get the correct answer. For example, if all of the points are collinear, the minimum number of turns is 1. A developer should handle this case correctly, making sure to return the correct answer.

HACKEREARTH roy-and-trains-2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The input is a list of integers, but the code is expecting a list of strings. This will cause the code to fail.
2. **Incorrect variable name.** The variable `t` is used to store the number of test cases, but the code is using it to store the time it takes for Roy to reach station A. This will cause the code to produce incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect calculation.** The code is calculating the total time it takes for Roy to reach city B by adding the time it takes for him to reach station A to the time it takes for the train to reach city B. However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not take into account the time it takes for the train to depart.
4. **Incorrect output.** The code is printing the total time it takes for Roy to reach city B, but the problem statement asks for the minimum time. This will cause the code to produce incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The code does not handle the case where it is not possible for Roy to reach city B. This will cause the code to crash.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully check the input and output of your code, and make sure that you are using the correct variable types and names. You should also double-check your calculations to make sure that they are correct. Finally, you should add error handling to your code to handle the case where it is not possible for Roy to reach city B.

Title:
HACKEREARTH substring-5

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of substrings.** A developer may incorrectly count the number of substrings by counting each substring multiple times. For example, if the input string is "abc", the developer may incorrectly count the substrings "a", "b", and "c" as three separate substrings, when in reality they are all part of the same substring "abc".
2. **Not considering all possible substrings.** A developer may not consider all possible substrings when counting the number of substrings. For example, if the input string is "abc", the developer may not consider the substring "cba" as a valid substring, even though it is.
3. **Using incorrect data types.** A developer may use incorrect data types when counting the number of substrings. For example, if the input string is "abc", the developer may use an integer to store the number of substrings, when in reality they should be using a long integer.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** A developer may make off-by-one errors when counting the number of substrings. For example, if the input string is "abc", the developer may incorrectly count the number of substrings as 4, when in reality it is 3.
5. **Incorrectly handling boundary conditions.** A developer may incorrectly handle boundary conditions when counting the number of substrings. For example, if the input string is "", the developer may incorrectly count the number of substrings as 0, when in reality it is 1.

Title:
HACKEREARTH very-cool-numbers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 is 1, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1. However, many developers mistakenly use the modulo operator to check if a number is divisible by another number. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
if (number % divisor == 0):
  # The number is divisible by divisor
else:
  # The number is not divisible by divisor
```

The correct way to check if a number is divisible by another number is to use the bitwise AND operator (&). For example, the following code will work correctly:

```
if (number & divisor == 0):
  # The number is divisible by divisor
else:
  # The number is not divisible by divisor
```

2. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a developer forgets to account for the first or last element in an array or list. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
for i in range(0, len(list)):
  # Do something with the element at index i
```

This code will not work correctly because it does not account for the first element in the list. To fix this bug, we need to add 1 to the range() function:

```
for i in range(1, len(list) + 1):
  # Do something with the element at index i
```

3. **Using the wrong data type.** Another common type of bug is using the wrong data type. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
number = "100"

if number % 2 == 0:
  # The number is even
else:
  # The number is odd
```

This code will not work correctly because the variable `number` is a string, not an integer. To fix this bug, we need to convert the string to an integer:

```
number = int("100")

if number % 2 == 0:
  # The number is even
else:
  # The number is odd
```

4. **Using incorrect logic.** Another common type of bug is using incorrect logic. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
if number < 10:
  # The number is small
else:
  # The number is large
```

This code will not work correctly because it does not account for the fact that the number 10 is both small and large. To fix this bug, we need to use more specific logic:

```
if number < 5:
  # The number is small
elif number < 10:
  # The number is medium
else:
  # The number is large
```

Title:
ATCODER p02609 AIsing Programming Contest 2020 - Anything Goes to Zero

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the `popcount` function.** The `popcount` function counts the number of `1`s in the binary representation of a number. A common mistake is to implement the function incorrectly, by counting the number of bits that are set to `1` instead of the number of `1`s. This will result in incorrect answers.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the `f` function.** The `f` function computes the number of times the following operation will be done when it is repeated until the number becomes 0: "replace the number with the remainder when it is divided by its `popcount`." A common mistake is to forget to divide the number by its `popcount` before computing the remainder. This will result in incorrect answers.
3. **Incorrect use of the `mod` operator.** The `mod` operator returns the remainder when a number is divided by another number. A common mistake is to use the `mod` operator incorrectly, by using it to compute the remainder when a number is divided by zero. This will result in a runtime error.
4. **Incorrect use of the `for` loop.** The `for` loop iterates over a sequence of values. A common mistake is to use the `for` loop incorrectly, by iterating over a sequence of values that does not exist. This will result in a runtime error.
5. **Incorrect use of the `if` statement.** The `if` statement checks a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true. A common mistake is to use the `if` statement incorrectly, by checking a condition that is always false. This will result in the block of code never being executed.
6. **Incorrect use of the `else` statement.** The `else` statement executes a block of code if the condition in the `if` statement is false. A common mistake is to use the `else` statement incorrectly, by not providing a block of code to execute if the condition is false. This will result in the program terminating unexpectedly.
7. **Incorrect use of the `break` statement.** The `break` statement terminates the `for` loop immediately. A common mistake is to use the `break` statement incorrectly, by terminating the `for` loop when the condition is not met. This will result in the `for` loop not iterating over all of the values in the sequence.
8. **Incorrect use of the `continue` statement.** The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the `for` loop and continues with the next iteration. A common mistake is to use the `continue` statement incorrectly, by skipping an iteration of the `for` loop when the condition is met. This will result in the `for` loop not iterating over all of the values in the sequence.

Title:
ATCODER p02875 AtCoder Grand Contest 040 - Neither AB nor BA

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo**

When computing the final answer, it is important to use the correct modulo. In this problem, the modulo is 998244353. If you accidentally use a different modulo, your answer will be incorrect.

**2. Not handling the base case correctly**

The base case for this problem is when N = 2. In this case, there are only three possible strings: `AA`, `AB`, and `AC`. Each of these strings can be converted to the empty string by erasing one character, so the answer is 3.

**3. Making a mistake in the recursive solution**

The recursive solution for this problem is a bit tricky. It is important to make sure that you are correctly handling the cases where the string starts with `A`, `B`, or `C`.

**4. Using an incorrect formula**

The formula for the number of strings that satisfy the conditions is given in the problem statement. It is important to make sure that you are using the correct formula.

**5. Not using enough precision**

The answer to this problem can be very large. It is important to make sure that you are using enough precision to store the answer correctly.

Title:
ATCODER p03149 KEYENCE Programming Contest 2019 - Beginning

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input is four integers, so the developer should use `int` or `long` to store them. Using a smaller data type like `char` or `short` could lead to incorrect results.

**2. Not checking for invalid input**

The input is guaranteed to be four integers, but the developer should still check for invalid input, such as non-numeric characters or negative numbers.

**3. Not using the correct comparison operator**

The question asks if the digits can be arranged into the sequence "1974". This means that the digits must be in the same order, not just any permutation of the digits. The developer should use the `<=` and `>=` operators to compare the digits, not the `==` operator.

**4. Not handling duplicate digits**

The question does not specify whether duplicate digits are allowed. If duplicate digits are not allowed, the developer should check for them and return `NO` if any duplicates are found.

**5. Not using the right algorithm**

The most efficient way to solve this problem is to use a greedy algorithm. The developer should start with the digit `1` and then add the digits `9`, `7`, and `4` in that order. If any of the digits are not available, the developer should return `NO`.

**6. Not handling edge cases**

The developer should test their code with edge cases, such as the following:

* All four digits are the same.
* The first three digits are the same.
* The last three digits are the same.
* The first and last digits are the same.
* The digits are in reverse order.

By following these tips, the developer can avoid common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

ATCODER p03609 AtCoder Beginner Contest 072 - Sandglass2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The input is given in the format `X t`, where `X` and `t` are integers. However, if the developer does not explicitly cast `X` and `t` to integers, they may be interpreted as strings and cause errors.
2. **Off-by-one error.** The problem states that the upper bulb initially contains `X` grams of sand. However, if the developer subtracts `1` from `X` to account for the sand that drops in the first second, they will get the wrong answer.
3. **Incorrect calculation.** The problem states that the sand drops from the upper bulb at a rate of `1` gram per second. However, if the developer does not divide `X` by `t` to find the number of grams of sand that remain in the upper bulb after `t` seconds, they will get the wrong answer.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The problem states that the output should be the number of grams of sand in the upper bulb after `t` seconds. However, if the developer does not print the output in the correct format, their submission will be rejected.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

* Always explicitly cast `X` and `t` to integers.
* Be careful not to make off-by-one errors.
* Make sure to correctly calculate the number of grams of sand that remain in the upper bulb after `t` seconds.
* Print the output in the correct format.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs that developers encounter when solving this problem.

ATCODER p03770 AtCoder Grand Contest 012 - Colorful Balls

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The developer may make a mistake in implementing the algorithm, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may forget to account for a special case or may make a mistake in a calculation.
2. **Incorrect input or output format.** The developer may incorrectly parse the input or format the output, which could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results. For example, the developer may use the wrong data type to store the input or output, or may forget to add a newline character to the end of the output.
3. **Memory management errors.** The developer may incorrectly allocate or free memory, which could lead to the program crashing or leaking memory. For example, the developer may allocate memory that is never freed, or may free memory that is still in use.
4. **Synchronization errors.** The developer may incorrectly synchronize access to shared data, which could lead to data corruption or deadlocks. For example, the developer may access a shared variable without locking it, or may release a lock before another thread has acquired it.
5. **Security vulnerabilities.** The developer may introduce a security vulnerability in the program, which could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system. For example, the developer may store sensitive data in an insecure location, or may implement a function that is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully review their code and test it thoroughly before deploying it to production. They should also use a debugger to help identify and fix errors.

Title:
ATCODER p03939 AtCoder Grand Contest 007 - Pushing Balls

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

When working with floating-point numbers, it is important to use the correct data type. For example, if you are working with numbers that are very small or very large, you may need to use a `double` instead of a `float`. In this problem, the input values are all integers, but the output value is a floating-point number. So you should use a `double` to store the output value.

**2. Not using the right formula**

The formula for calculating the expected total distance rolled by all balls is:

```
E[D] = (N * d_1 + (N - 1) * x) * (1 + 1 / N)
```

where `N` is the number of balls, `d_1` is the distance between the first ball and the first hole, and `x` is the distance between each pair of adjacent balls and holes.

**3. Making a mistake in the implementation**

Once you have the correct formula, you need to implement it correctly. This is where most of the bugs in this problem will come from. Here are a few common mistakes to watch out for:

* Using the wrong variable names
* Forgetting to initialize variables
* Making a mistake in the arithmetic
* Using the wrong data type

**4. Not handling special cases correctly**

There are a few special cases that you need to handle correctly in this problem. For example, what happens if `N` is equal to 1? What happens if `d_1` is equal to 0? What happens if `x` is equal to 0?

**5. Not testing your code**

Once you have implemented your solution, it is important to test it thoroughly. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed. Here are a few things to keep in mind when testing your code:

* Use a variety of test cases
* Test your code with both positive and negative values
* Test your code with both small and large values
* Test your code with both edge cases and normal cases

By following these tips, you can help to avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

AIZU p00162 Hamming Numbers

Pain points:
```
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that two integers m and n should be given on one line, separated by blanks. However, the input may contain other characters, such as spaces, tabs, or newlines. This can cause the program to crash or output incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of humming numbers**. The program must correctly calculate the number of humming numbers between m and n. This can be a difficult task, as there are many possible combinations of 2, 3, and 5 that can be used to generate humming numbers. The program must be careful to avoid double-counting humming numbers that are generated multiple times.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the number of humming numbers should be output on one line. However, the program may output the results in a different format, such as multiple lines or a table. This can make it difficult to interpret the results.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. The input may contain edge cases, such as m = n or m > n. The program must be able to handle these edge cases correctly without crashing or producing incorrect results.
5. **Insufficient error handling**. The program should be able to handle errors gracefully, such as invalid input or a divide-by-zero error. The program should not crash or produce incorrect results in these cases.

Title:
AIZU p00319 Downhill Race

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input format is not clear. For example, it is not clear whether the first line contains the number of flags and the number of lines, or the number of flags and the number of lines is given in separate lines.
* The output format is not clear. For example, it is not clear whether the output should be the total time of the two downhills, or the shortest time of the two downhills.
* The problem statement does not specify how to handle ties. For example, if there are two ways to ski that both have the same total time, it is not clear which way should be chosen.
* The problem statement does not specify how to handle the case where the skier cannot reach the goal from the starting point. For example, if there is no line that connects the starting point to the goal, it is not clear what the skier should do.
* The problem statement does not specify how to handle the case where the skier passes the same line twice. For example, if the skier passes the same line twice, it is not clear what the time for the second pass should be.
* The problem statement does not specify how to handle the case where the skier changes the order of the lines that they pass. For example, if the skier passes the lines in a different order in the two downhills, it is not clear what the total time should be.

**Possible solutions:**

* The input format can be made clearer by specifying that the first line contains the number of flags and the number of lines, and the following lines contain information about the lines.
* The output format can be made clearer by specifying that the output should be the shortest time of the two downhills.
* The problem statement can be clarified by specifying how to handle ties and the case where the skier cannot reach the goal from the starting point.
* The problem statement can be clarified by specifying how to handle the case where the skier passes the same line twice.
* The problem statement can be clarified by specifying how to handle the case where the skier changes the order of the lines that they pass.

**Additional notes:**

* The problem statement is very long and complex. It would be helpful to break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces.
* The problem statement uses a lot of technical jargon. It would be helpful to provide definitions of the terms that are used.
* The problem statement is not very clear about the overall goal of the problem. It would be helpful to provide a more detailed explanation of what the skier is trying to achieve.

1. The input format is not very clear. It is not obvious how to parse the input into a data structure that can be used to solve the problem.
2. The problem statement does not specify how to handle ties. For example, if two confetti are exactly the same size and they are stacked on top of each other, is only one of them visible, or are both of them visible?
3. The problem statement does not specify how to handle confetti that are exactly on the edge of the table. For example, if a confetti is located at (0, 0, 0.5), is it visible or not?
4. The problem statement does not specify how to handle confetti that are exactly on top of each other. For example, if two confetti are located at (0, 0, 0) and (0, 0, 0.5), is only one of them visible, or are both of them visible?
5. The problem statement does not specify how to handle confetti that are inside of each other. For example, if a confetti is located at (0, 0, 0.5) and another confetti is located at (0, 0, 0.25), is only the outer confetti visible, or are both confetti visible?
6. The problem statement does not specify how to handle confetti that are infinitesimally small. For example, if a confetti is located at (0, 0, 0) and it has a radius of 0, is it visible or not?

Title:
AIZU p00949 Hidden Anagrams

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over the strings, it is important to make sure that the indices are correct. For example, if you are trying to find all occurrences of a substring in a string, you need to make sure that you don't start the search at the end of the string, or you will miss the last occurrence.
2. **Incorrect string comparison.** When comparing two strings, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct comparison method. For example, you should use the `equals()` method to compare strings, not the `==` operator. The `==` operator compares the references of two objects, not their contents.
3. **Memory leaks.** When you create a new object, it is important to make sure that you delete it when you are finished with it. If you don't, you will create a memory leak. Memory leaks can eventually cause your program to crash.
4. **Incorrect data types.** When you are passing data to a function, it is important to make sure that the data is of the correct type. For example, if you are passing a string to a function that expects an integer, the function will not work correctly.
5. **Uncaught exceptions.** When your program encounters an error, it should throw an exception. If you don't catch the exception, your program will crash. It is important to catch and handle exceptions gracefully so that your program can continue running.

Title:
AIZU p01082 Escape of Lappin the Phantom Thief

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain non-integer values, or the number of robots may not be equal to the number of coordinates. This can lead to errors in the program's output.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the maximum travel time**

The maximum travel time is calculated by adding the distances from each robot to the jewel. However, the distances may not be calculated correctly if the robots are not in a straight line. This can lead to the program outputting an incorrect answer.

**3. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

The problem may contain edge cases that are not handled correctly by the program. For example, the problem may contain a jewel in a corner of the grid, or the robots may be arranged in a way that prevents them from reaching the jewel. This can lead to the program crashing or outputting an incorrect answer.

**4. Incorrect use of data structures**

The program may use data structures that are not appropriate for the problem. For example, the program may use a linked list to store the robots, which can lead to inefficient performance.

**5. Incorrect use of algorithms**

The program may use algorithms that are not appropriate for the problem. For example, the program may use a brute-force algorithm to find the maximum travel time, which can lead to a very slow runtime.

**6. Incorrect error handling**

The program may not handle errors correctly. For example, the program may not handle invalid input or exceptions. This can lead to the program crashing or outputting an incorrect answer.

**7. Incorrect testing**

The program may not be tested thoroughly. This can lead to errors that are not caught until the program is deployed in production.

**8. Incorrect documentation**

The program's documentation may be incorrect or incomplete. This can make it difficult for other developers to understand how the program works.

**9. Incorrect security**

The program may not be secure. For example, the program may allow users to input malicious data that can be used to attack the system. This can lead to data breaches or other security problems.

Title:
AIZU p02116 nCm

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the combination formula.** The combination formula is given by $\binom{n}{m} = \frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!}$. It is important to use the factorial function correctly, and to make sure that the arguments are non-negative integers.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** It is easy to make a mistake when computing the smallest m such that $\binom{n}{m}$ is even. One common mistake is to forget to add 1 to m. Another common mistake is to use the wrong sign when comparing m to $\frac{n}{2}$.
3. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The factorial function can overflow if n is large. It is important to use a large enough integer type to avoid this problem.
4. **Incorrect handling of negative numbers.** The combination formula is not defined for negative numbers. It is important to check that n and m are non-negative before computing $\binom{n}{m}$.
5. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.** The combination formula can be approximated using floating-point arithmetic. However, it is important to be aware of the rounding errors that can occur when using floating-point numbers.
6. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) can be used to compute the remainder of a division. However, it is important to be aware of the fact that the modulo operator does not always return the smallest possible remainder. This can lead to errors when computing the smallest m such that $\binom{n}{m}$ is even.

Title:
AIZU p02256 Greatest Common Divisor

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 is 1. This means that 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1. However, some developers may incorrectly use the modulo operator to check if one number is divisible by another. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
if (a % b == 0):
  print("b is a divisor of a")
```

This code would print "b is a divisor of a" even if b is not actually a divisor of a. The correct way to check if one number is divisible by another is to use the `divmod()` function. The `divmod()` function takes two numbers as arguments and returns a tuple containing the quotient and remainder of the division operation. For example, `divmod(10, 3)` returns the tuple `(3, 1)`. The quotient is 3, which means that 10 divided by 3 is 3 with no remainder. The remainder is 1, which means that 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.

2. **Incorrect use of the Euclidean algorithm.** The Euclidean algorithm is a recursive algorithm that can be used to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers. The algorithm works by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger number until the two numbers are equal. The final number is the greatest common divisor of the two original numbers. For example, the greatest common divisor of 10 and 15 is 5. The Euclidean algorithm would find this by repeatedly subtracting 15 from 10 until the two numbers are equal:

```
10 - 15 = -5
-5 - 15 = -20
-20 - 15 = -35
-35 - 15 = -50
-50 - 15 = -65
-65 - 15 = -80
-80 - 15 = -95
-95 - 15 = -110
-110 - 15 = -125
-125 - 15 = -140
-140 - 15 = -155
-155 - 15 = -170
-170 - 15 = -185
-185 - 15 = -200
-200 - 15 = -215
-215 - 15 = -230
-230 - 15 = -245
-245 - 15 = -260
-260 - 15 = -275
-275 - 15 = -290
-290 - 15 = -305
-305 - 15 = -320
-320 - 15 = -335
-335 - 15 = -350
-350 - 15 = -365
-365 - 15 = -380
-380 - 15 = -395
-395 - 15 = -410
-410 - 15 = -425
-425 - 15 = -440
-440 - 15 = -455
-455 - 15 = -470
-470 - 15 = -485
-485 - 15 = -500
```

The final number, -500, is the greatest common divisor of 10 and 15.

However, some developers may incorrectly use the Euclidean algorithm. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
def gcd(a, b):
  while a != b:
    if a > b:
      a -= b
    else:
      b -= a
  return a

print(gcd(10, 15))
```

This code would return 10, which is not the greatest common divisor of 10 and 15. The correct way to use the Euclidean algorithm is to use the `while` loop to continue subtracting the smaller number from the larger number until the two numbers are equal. Once the two numbers are equal, the final number is the greatest common divisor of the two original numbers.

```

The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect output. For example, if the input is "3 4 5", the program will incorrectly parse the input as "3 4 5 5", and the output will be incorrect.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correctly generated, which can lead to incorrect output. For example, if the output is "####\n#..#\n####", the program will incorrectly print the frame with a space between the two lines, and the output will be incorrect.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic of the program is incorrect, which can lead to incorrect output. For example, if the program does not check if the input is valid, it will incorrectly print the frame for an invalid input, and the output will be incorrect.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format, output format, and logic of the program.
