Title:
CODECHEF tapalin

Pain points:
100 is divisible by 4. So there are 25 palindromes of length 25, 25 palindromes of length 24, 25 palindromes of length 23, and 25 palindromes of length 22. So the answer is 25 * 4 = 100.

 **1. Using the wrong modulo**

When computing the answer, you may accidentally use the wrong modulo. For example, you may compute the answer modulo 100 instead of 1000000007. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**2. Not handling the case where N is 1**

The problem states that the answer can be quite large. This means that you need to handle the case where N is 1. If you don't handle this case correctly, your code will not work for all test cases.

**3. Using an incorrect formula**

The formula for computing the number of palindromes of length N is:

```
P(N) = P(N - 2) + 26 * P(N - 1)
```

where P(N) is the number of palindromes of length N and P(0) = 1. If you use an incorrect formula, your code will not produce the correct answer.

**4. Not using enough precision**

The answer to the problem can be quite large. This means that you need to use enough precision to store the answer. If you don't use enough precision, your code will produce an incorrect answer.

**5. Not using the right data type**

The answer to the problem can be quite large. This means that you need to use the right data type to store the answer. If you use the wrong data type, your code will produce an incorrect answer.

CODEFORCES 1225_B1. TV Subscriptions (Easy Version)

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very strict. It is possible to enter the data in different ways, but the program should be able to handle all of them. For example, the input could be a single line with all the numbers separated by spaces, or it could be multiple lines with each number on its own line. The program should be able to handle all of these cases.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also not very strict. The program should be able to print the answer in any way that is readable. For example, the answer could be a single number, or it could be a list of numbers, or it could be a string. The program should be able to handle all of these cases.

**3. Overflow errors**

The program should be careful not to overflow the integer data type. For example, if the input is a very large number, the program should not try to store it in an integer variable. Instead, the program should use a floating-point variable or a string variable.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

The program should be careful not to make off-by-one errors. For example, if the input is a list of numbers, the program should not try to access the element at index n+1 if n is the last element in the list.

**5. Logical errors**

The program should be careful not to make logical errors. For example, the program should not assume that the input is always valid. The program should also be careful not to make assumptions about the data.

**6. Runtime errors**

The program should be careful not to make runtime errors. For example, the program should not try to divide by zero. The program should also be careful not to allocate too much memory.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1310_B. Double Elimination

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `k` integers. The integers `n` and `k` should be positive integers and the list of `k` integers should be a list of distinct positive integers. However, a developer may accidentally input an incorrect format, such as a negative integer or a list of non-integers. This would cause the program to crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer. However, a developer may accidentally output a non-integer or a list of integers. This would cause the program to produce incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic for this problem is fairly complex. A developer may make a mistake in their implementation, such as forgetting to account for all possible cases or using incorrect data structures. This would cause the program to produce incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect time complexity**

The time complexity of the naive solution to this problem is `O(2^n)`. A developer may be able to improve the time complexity by using more efficient data structures or algorithms. This would make the program run faster.

**5. Incorrect space complexity**

The space complexity of the naive solution to this problem is `O(n)`. A developer may be able to reduce the space complexity by using more efficient data structures or algorithms. This would make the program use less memory.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1332_G. No Monotone Triples

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the input may not have two integers n and q, or the integers may not be in the correct range.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the output may not have the correct number of integers, or the integers may not be in the correct range.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not find the correct answer, or it may take too long to run.
4. **Incorrect data structures**. The data structures used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the data structures may not be able to store the input data efficiently, or they may not be able to perform the required operations efficiently.
5. **Incorrect implementation**. The implementation of the algorithm may be incorrect. For example, the implementation may contain bugs, or it may not be able to run correctly on all platforms.
6. **Incorrect testing**. The testing of the solution may be incorrect. For example, the tests may not test all of the possible cases, or they may not test the solution in a way that is representative of how it will be used in practice.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to design and implement the algorithm carefully and to test the solution thoroughly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1373_B. 01 Game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is not very strict, but it does require that the first line of the input contains a single integer t, which represents the number of test cases. If this format is not followed, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output for this problem must be a single line for each test case. Each line must either contain the string "DA" (which means "yes" in Russian) or the string "NET" (which means "no" in Russian). If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly output the results and will likely crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic for this problem is relatively simple, but there are a few common mistakes that developers make. One common mistake is to forget to check if the input string is empty. Another common mistake is to incorrectly check if Alice can make a move.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that can occur when programming. In this problem, an off-by-one error could occur if the developer accidentally indexes into the input string one character too far or one character too few.
5. **Memory errors**. Memory errors can occur when a program allocates too much or too little memory. In this problem, a memory error could occur if the developer allocates an array to store the input string and the array is not large enough to hold the entire string.
6. **Time complexity**. The time complexity of this problem is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. If the developer's algorithm has a time complexity that is worse than O(n), the program will likely run very slowly.
7. **Space complexity**. The space complexity of this problem is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. If the developer's algorithm uses more space than O(n), the program will likely run out of memory.

CODEFORCES 1396_A. Multiples of Length

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect, which may lead to the program producing incorrect output. For example, if the algorithm does not consider all possible cases, it may produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect implementation**. The program may be incorrectly implemented, which may lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output. For example, if the program uses incorrect variable names or data types, it may crash or produce incorrect output.
4. **Runtime errors**. The program may run into runtime errors, such as running out of memory or encountering an infinite loop. These errors can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
5. **Logic errors**. The program may contain logic errors, such as using the wrong variable or making an incorrect calculation. These errors can cause the program to produce incorrect output.
6. **User errors**. The user may make errors when entering the input or using the program. These errors can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
Test inputs:
1. Incorrect input format:
```
3
1 2 3
```
This input is not in the correct format, because it does not contain a single integer on the first line.

2. Incorrect algorithm:
```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(3):
    l, r = map(int, input().split())
    b = [0] * (r - l + 1)
    for j in range(r - l + 1):
        b[j] = -1
    print(l, r)
    print(*b)
```
This algorithm is incorrect, because it does not consider the case where the sum of the elements in the segment is not divisible by the length of the segment.

3. Incorrect implementation:
```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(3):
    l, r = map(int, input().split())
    b = [0] * (r - l + 1)
    for j in range(r - l + 1):
        b[j] = -1
    print(l, r)
    print(*b)
```
This implementation is incorrect, because it does not use the correct variable names.

4. Runtime errors:
```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(3):
    l, r = map(int, input().split())
    b = [0] * (r - l + 1)
    for j in range(r - l + 1):
        b[j] = -1
    print(l, r)
    print(*b)

while True:
    pass
```
This program will run into a runtime error, because it will enter an infinite loop.

5. Logic errors:
```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(3):
    l, r = map(int, input().split())
    b = [0] * (r - l + 1)
    for j in range(r - l + 1):
        b[j] = -1
    print(l, r)
    print(*b)

sum = 0
for i in range(n):
    sum += a[i]

print(sum)
```
This program contains a logic error, because it does not correctly calculate the sum of the elements in the array.

6. User errors:
```
input()
```
This input will cause the program to crash, because it does not provide any input.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1438_C. Engineer Artem

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very strict. It allows for multiple test cases, each of which is defined by two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` lines of `m` integers. However, some developers may not be familiar with this format and may accidentally write incorrect input. For example, they might forget to include the newline character between the two integers `n` and `m`, or they might include too many or too few lines of input. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also not very strict. It allows for the output of `n` lines of `m` integers, each of which is either the same as the corresponding input value or one greater than the corresponding input value. However, some developers may not be familiar with this format and may accidentally output incorrect values. For example, they might output a value that is less than the corresponding input value, or they might output a value that is not an integer. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve this problem is not very complex. However, some developers may make mistakes in their implementation. For example, they might forget to check for boundary conditions, or they might use an incorrect data structure. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.

**4. Incorrect debugging**

When debugging a program, it is important to be able to identify the source of the error. Some developers may not be familiar with the debugging tools available in their programming language, or they may not know how to use them effectively. This can make it difficult to identify and fix the errors in their program.

**5. Incorrect testing**

It is important to test a program thoroughly before releasing it to the public. This helps to ensure that the program is working correctly and that it is free of bugs. Some developers may not be familiar with the testing tools available in their programming language, or they may not know how to use them effectively. This can lead to the release of a program that is full of bugs.

CODEFORCES 1463_B. Find The Array

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct.**

The input format of the problem is:

```
The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
```

However, the input format in the example is:

```
4
5
1 2 3 4 5
2
4 6
2
1 1000000000
6
3 4 8 1 2 3
```

The input format in the example is not correct because it does not have a line break between the first and second test cases.

**2. The output format is not correct.**

The output format of the problem is:

```
For each test case, print the beautiful array b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9) on a separate line. It can be shown that at least one beautiful array exists under these circumstances. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
```

However, the output format in the example is:

```
3 3 3 3 3
3 6
1 1000000000
4 4 8 1 3 3
```

The output format in the example is not correct because it does not have a line break between the output of the first and second test cases.

**3. The code does not correctly find the beautiful array.**

The code in the example does not correctly find the beautiful array. The code should find the beautiful array by iterating through all possible arrays and checking if each array is beautiful. However, the code in the example only iterates through a few possible arrays and does not check if each array is beautiful.

**4. The code does not handle all test cases correctly.**

The code in the example does not handle all test cases correctly. For example, the code does not handle the test case where the input array is empty.
Test inputs:
```
# 1. The input format is not correct.

```
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# 2. The output format is not correct.

```
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())

        if sum([abs(a[i] - b) for i in range(n)]) <= n * b:
            print(b)
            break

# 4. The code does not handle all test cases correctly.

```
t = int(input())

Title:
CODEFORCES 148_B. Escape

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input contains a letter instead of a number, the program may not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The program may make a mistake in calculating the distance between the princess and the dragon, or the time it takes for the dragon to catch up to the princess. This could result in the princess being caught by the dragon, even if she has enough bijous to distract him.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program may not correctly implement the logic for when the princess drops a bijou to distract the dragon. For example, the program may not correctly calculate the amount of time it takes for the dragon to return to the cave and fix the treasury. This could result in the princess being caught by the dragon, even if she has enough bijous to distract him.
4. **Incorrect output**. The program may not correctly output the number of bijous that the princess needs to take from the treasury. For example, the program may output a negative number, or a number that is greater than the number of bijous that the princess actually has.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully follow the input format and to correctly implement the logic for the program. It is also helpful to test the program with a variety of input values to make sure that it is working correctly.

CODEFORCES 1511_F. Chainword

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correct. For example, the input may not have two integers n and m, or the values of n and m may not be within the specified range.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correct. For example, the output may not be a single integer, or the value of the output may not be within the specified range.
* **Incorrect calculation:** The calculation of the number of chainwords may be incorrect. For example, the calculation may not take into account all possible combinations of strings, hints, and segments.
* **Memory overflow:** The program may run out of memory while calculating the number of chainwords. This can happen if the number of words in the dictionary is large, or if the length of the strings is large.
* **Time limit exceeded:** The program may not finish running within the specified time limit. This can happen if the number of words in the dictionary is large, or if the length of the strings is large.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format, output format, and calculation of the number of chainwords. It is also important to use efficient algorithms and data structures to minimize the amount of memory used and the amount of time required to run the program.

CODEFORCES 1539_D. PriceFixed

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm.** The greedy algorithm in this problem is to first buy all the items that do not have a discount, and then buy the items that have a discount. However, if the items that do not have a discount are not bought in the correct order, the total cost may be higher than necessary. For example, in the input ```
3
3 4
1 3
1 5
```, if we buy the items in the order ```1, 3, 1```, the total cost will be ```8```, but if we buy the items in the order ```1, 3, 5```, the total cost will be ```7```.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the priority queue.** The priority queue in this problem is used to store the items that have a discount. However, if the items are not inserted into the priority queue in the correct order, the total cost may be higher than necessary. For example, in the input ```
3
3 4
1 3

CODEFORCES 282_B. Painting Eggs

Pain points:
```
Possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is not very strict. It is possible for a developer to accidentally misread the input format and write incorrect code. For example, the input format specifies that the first line should contain an integer n, but a developer might accidentally read the first line as a string. This would cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect logic.** The logic for this problem is fairly complex. It is possible for a developer to make a mistake in their logic and produce incorrect output. For example, the developer might incorrectly calculate the total amount of money that Uncle J. must pay A. and G. This would cause the program to output the wrong answer.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that can occur when programming. In this problem, a developer might accidentally iterate over the input one too many or one too few times. This would cause the program to output the wrong answer.
4. **Memory leaks.** Memory leaks can occur when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash. In this problem, a developer might accidentally create a memory leak by allocating memory for a variable that is no longer needed. This would cause the program to crash.
5. **Race conditions.** Race conditions can occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output or crash. In this problem, a developer might accidentally create a race condition by allowing two threads to access the same data at the same time. This would cause the program to produce incorrect output or crash.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully read the problem statement and understand the input format and output format. They should also carefully write their code and test it thoroughly.**

CODEFORCES 331_A2. Oh Sweet Beaverette

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type for the input/output.**

The input and output of this problem are both integers. If you use a data type that is not large enough to store the input, you will get an overflow error. For example, if you use `int` to store the input, you will get an overflow error if the input is larger than `2147483647`.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm.**

The correct algorithm for this problem is to find the two trees with the same esthetic appeal and cut down all the trees in between them. However, if you use an incorrect algorithm, you will get the wrong answer.

**3. Making a mistake in your implementation.**

Even if you use the correct algorithm, you can still make a mistake in your implementation. For example, you might forget to add the esthetic appeal of the two trees with the same esthetic appeal to the total esthetic appeal.

**4. Not handling edge cases correctly.**

The problem statement specifies that the input must be a positive integer. However, if you do not check for this, you might get an error when you try to read the input.

**5. Not using the correct data structures.**

The problem statement does not specify what data structures you can use. However, using the correct data structures can make your code more efficient. For example, you can use a `set` to store the trees that you need to cut down.

CODEFORCES 399_C. Cards

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is two space-separated integers a and b. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer v, which is the maximum score that ainta can obtain. The output should also be a string of a+b characters describing the deck. If the k-th card of the deck contains "o", the k-th character must be "o". If the k-th card of the deck contains "x", the k-th character must be "x". The number of "o" characters must be equal to a, and the number of "x " characters must be equal to b. If there are many ways to maximize v, print any. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly output the answer and will produce incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the score**

The score of the deck is calculated by the formula below.

```
Score = Sum of squares of the lengths of all "o" blocks - Sum of squares of the lengths of all "x" blocks
```

If the calculation of the score is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly find the maximum score and will produce incorrect output.

**4. Incorrect arrangement of the cards**

The cards must be arranged in a row, and the number of "o" characters must be equal to a, and the number of "x " characters must be equal to b. If the cards are not arranged correctly, the program will not be able to correctly output the answer and will produce incorrect output.

**5. Inefficient algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve this problem can be inefficient, which will lead to a slow runtime.

**6. Incorrect use of data structures**

The incorrect use of data structures can lead to incorrect results. For example, if a vector is used to store the cards, the order of the cards will not be preserved, which will lead to incorrect results.

**7. Memory leaks**

Memory leaks can occur when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

CODEFORCES 421_D. Bug in Code

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not correctly followed, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the input format is incorrect, the program may not be able to parse the input correctly and may crash.
2. **Incorrect variable type.** The variable type is not correctly specified, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if a variable is declared as an integer but is assigned a string value, the program may crash.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program is incorrect, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the program is supposed to find the maximum value in an array, but the logic is incorrect, the program may return the wrong value.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors occur when the programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the programmer is supposed to iterate through an array from 0 to n-1, but the programmer forgets to decrement the index by one, the program may access an element outside of the array and crash.
5. **Memory leaks.** Memory leaks occur when the programmer does not free up memory that is no longer needed, which may eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash. For example, if the programmer creates a new object but does not delete it when it is no longer needed, the object will continue to occupy memory and eventually cause the program to run out of memory.
6. **Race conditions.** Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time, which may cause the program to produce incorrect output or crash. For example, if two threads are both trying to update the same variable at the same time, the variable may be updated incorrectly or the program may crash.
7. **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, which may cause the program to hang indefinitely. For example, if two threads are both trying to lock the same mutex, the threads will wait for each other to release the mutex and the program will hang indefinitely.
8. **Buffer overflows.** Buffer overflows occur when a program writes more data to a buffer than the buffer can hold, which may cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code. For example, if a program writes more data to a buffer than the buffer is allocated for, the data will overwrite other parts of memory and may cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

CODEFORCES 448_B. Suffix Structures

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specified in the problem statement is very specific. Make sure that your input format is correct.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specified in the problem statement is very specific. Make sure that your output format is correct.
3. **Incorrect use of suffix automaton**. The suffix automaton can only be used to remove a single character from a string. Make sure that you are not trying to use it to do something else.
4. **Incorrect use of suffix array**. The suffix array can only be used to swap two characters in a string. Make sure that you are not trying to use it to do something else.
5. **Incorrect use of both suffix automaton and suffix array**. The suffix automaton and suffix array can be used together to solve the problem, but you need to make sure that you are using them correctly.
6. **Incorrect solution**. Even if you are using the suffix automaton and suffix array correctly, it is still possible to come up with an incorrect solution. Make sure that you are thinking carefully about the problem and that your solution is correct.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. **Read the problem statement carefully**. Make sure that you understand the problem before you start coding.
2. **Test your code**. Once you have written your code, test it to make sure that it is correct.
3. **Ask for help**. If you are stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help from a friend, family member, or teacher.

CODEFORCES 46_C. Hamsters and Tigers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer `n` and the second line should contain a string of `n` characters. However, a developer may accidentally forget to check the input format and assume that the input will always be correct. This could lead to a runtime error or incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of swaps.** The problem statement specifies that the trainer wants to swap the animals in pairs, so the number of swaps required is equal to `(n - 1) / 2`. However, a developer may accidentally calculate the number of swaps incorrectly. For example, they may forget to divide by 2 or they may incorrectly count the number of animals in the arena.
3. **Incorrect swapping of the animals.** The problem statement specifies that the animals should be swapped in pairs, so the developer must ensure that they swap the correct animals. For example, they must not swap two hamsters or two tigers.
4. **Incorrect output.** The problem statement specifies that the output should be a single integer, which is the number of swaps required. However, a developer may accidentally output the wrong value. For example, they may output a string instead of an integer or they may output a number that is not the correct number of swaps.
5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other potential bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, they may accidentally use the wrong data type, they may forget to initialize a variable, or they may make a logic error in their code.

CODEFORCES 516_C. Drazil and Park

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input format is not clear. For example, it is not clear whether the distances between consecutive trees are given in a single line or in multiple lines.
* The output format is not clear. For example, it is not clear whether the output should be a single number or a list of numbers.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if there are no two trees that are not affected by children.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the two trees that Drazil chooses are not consecutive.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the two trees that Drazil chooses are both affected by children.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the distance between the two trees that Drazil chooses is not unique.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the heights of the two trees that Drazil chooses are not unique.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the energy consumed by Drazil's morning run is not a positive integer.

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we can first construct a graph where the vertices are the trees and the edges are the distances between the trees. Then, we can find the two trees that are farthest apart and that are not affected by children. The energy consumed by Drazil's morning run is then the sum of the heights of the two trees plus the distance between them.

Here is an implementation of the solution in Python:

```python
def main():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    d = list(map(int, input().split()))
    h = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(m):
        ai, bi = map(int, input().split())
        # Find the two trees that are farthest apart and that are not affected by children.
        trees = []
        for i in range(n):
            if i < ai or i > bi:

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a negative number of dominoes, or the coordinates of a domino may be outside the specified range.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a list of integers, one for each domino. The integers should be separated by spaces.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of dominoes that will fall.** The developer may incorrectly calculate the number of dominoes that will fall if a domino is pushed to the right. For example, the developer may not take into account the fact that a domino can fall if it is touched above the base.
4. **Memory leaks.** The developer may not free up memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
5. **Thread safety issues.** The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data between multiple threads. This can lead to data corruption or incorrect results.
6. **Security vulnerabilities.** The developer may not properly protect sensitive data, such as passwords or credit card numbers. This can allow attackers to steal or misuse this data.

CODEFORCES 591_C. Median Smoothing

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly specified in the problem statement. For example, the input `5 0 0 1 1` is not valid because it contains a space between the first two numbers.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correctly specified in the problem statement. For example, the output `0 0 1 1` is not valid because it does not contain a newline character after the first line.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the following algorithm would not work:
```
def median_smoothing(sequence):
  """Computes the median smoothing of a sequence of zeros and ones."""

  # Initialize the new sequence.
  new_sequence = [sequence[0], sequence[-1]]

  # Iterate over the sequence, computing the median of each three consecutive elements.
  for i in range(1, len(sequence) - 1):
    new_sequence.append(median([sequence[i - 1], sequence[i], sequence[i + 1]]))

  # Return the new sequence.
  return new_sequence
```
This algorithm would not work because it does not correctly handle the case where the sequence contains an odd number of elements.
4. **Incorrect test cases**. The test cases provided with the problem may be incorrect. For example, the following test case would be incorrect:
```
n = 3
sequence = [0, 1, 0]
```
This test case would incorrectly indicate that the sequence is stable, when in fact it is not.
5. **Incorrect solution**. The solution provided to the problem may be incorrect. For example, the following solution would be incorrect:
```
def solve(n, sequence):
  """Solves the median smoothing problem."""

  # Initialize the number of steps required to stabilize the sequence.
  steps = 0

  # Iterate over the sequence, computing the median of each three consecutive elements.
  for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # Check if the sequence is stable.
    if sequence[i - 1] == sequence[i] == sequence[i + 1]:
      # The sequence is stable, so we can stop iterating.
      break

    # Increment the number of steps required to stabilize the sequence.
    steps += 1

  # Return the number of steps required to stabilize the sequence.

CODEFORCES 613_A. Peter and Snow Blower

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format handling.** The input format is not always strictly followed, so the program should be able to handle incorrect input formats gracefully. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces.
2. **Incorrect data type handling.** The input data may be of the wrong type, for example, a string instead of an integer. The program should be able to handle such errors gracefully.
3. **Incorrect mathematical operations.** The program may perform incorrect mathematical operations, such as dividing by zero. The program should be able to handle such errors gracefully.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The program may have incorrect logic, such as assuming that the input data is always valid. The program should be able to handle such errors gracefully.
5. **Incorrect output format.** The program may output the results in the wrong format. For example, the program may output the results in scientific notation, when the problem statement requires the results to be in decimal notation. The program should be able to handle such errors gracefully.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input format, data type handling, mathematical operations, logic, and output format.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is specified as "three integers a, b, c (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 1 ≤ c ≤ 10 000)". A developer may incorrectly parse the input and read it as "three integers a, b, c (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ c ≤ 10000)". This would cause the program to crash when it tries to access the value of c, which is outside of the specified range.
2. **Incorrect calculation of damage**. The program must calculate the total damage dealt by Ebony and Ivory and compare it to the required damage c. A developer may incorrectly calculate the damage, for example, by adding the values of a and b instead of multiplying them. This would cause the program to output the wrong answer.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output must be a single string, "Yes" or "No". A developer may incorrectly output multiple lines of text, or output a number instead of a string. This would cause the program to receive a wrong answer from the judge.
4. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the program may not handle invalid input correctly, or it may crash due to a memory allocation error. It is important to carefully test the program to ensure that it is free of bugs before submitting it to the judge.

Title:
CODEFORCES 661_D. Maximal Difference

Pain points:
### 1. **Off-by-one errors**.

The most common bug when solving this problem is to forget to subtract 1 from the index of the next element when computing the absolute value of the difference. This can result in an incorrect answer.

For example, if the input is `[2, 10, 4, 8, 6, 12]`, then the correct answer is 8, but if we forget to subtract 1 from the index of the next element, we will get 9 as the answer, which is incorrect.

### 2. **Incorrect use of the `abs()` function**.

The `abs()` function returns the absolute value of a number. However, if we pass a negative number to the `abs()` function, it will return a negative number. This can result in an incorrect answer.

For example, if the input is `[-2, 10, 4, 8, 6, 12]`, then the correct answer is 14, but if we use the `abs()` function incorrectly, we will get -14 as the answer, which is incorrect.

### 3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**.

The input to this problem may contain an empty array or an array with only one element. If we do not handle these edge cases correctly, we will get an incorrect answer.

For example, if the input is `[]`, then the correct answer is 0, but if we do not handle this edge case correctly, we will get an error.

### 4. **Using the wrong data type**.

The input to this problem is a list of integers. If we use the wrong data type to store the input, we may get an incorrect answer.

For example, if we use a `string` to store the input, we will not be able to perform mathematical operations on the input, and we will get an incorrect answer.
Test inputs:
```
# 1. Off-by-one errors

Input:
2 10 4 8 6 12

Expected output:
8

Incorrect output:
9

Explanation:
The correct answer is 8, but the incorrect output is 9. This is because the incorrect implementation forgot to subtract 1 from the index of the next element when computing the absolute value of the difference.

```
```
# 2. Incorrect use of the `abs()` function

Input:
-2 10 4 8 6 12

Expected output:
14

Incorrect output:
-14

Explanation:
The correct answer is 14, but the incorrect output is -14. This is because the incorrect implementation used the `abs()` function incorrectly, passing a negative number to the function.

```
```
# 3. Incorrect handling of edge cases

Input:
[]

Expected output:
0

Incorrect output:
Error

Explanation:
The correct answer is 0, but the incorrect implementation did not handle the edge case of an empty array correctly.

```
```
# 4. Using the wrong data type

Input:
['a', 'b', 'c']

Expected output:
Error

Incorrect output:
0

Explanation:
The correct answer is an error, because the input is a list of strings, not a list of integers.

CODEFORCES 708_C. Centroids

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the centroid finding algorithm.** The centroid finding algorithm is a recursive algorithm that takes a tree as input and returns the centroid of the tree. A common mistake is to incorrectly implement the algorithm, which can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The centroid finding algorithm can be tricky to implement correctly, and it is important to handle edge cases carefully. For example, the algorithm must be able to handle trees with no edges, trees with one edge, and trees with two edges.
3. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The centroid finding algorithm can be implemented using a variety of data structures. However, it is important to choose the right data structures for the problem, as this can affect the performance of the algorithm.
4. **Incorrect time complexity.** The centroid finding algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of vertices in the tree. However, it is possible to implement the algorithm in such a way that it has a time complexity of O(n log n).
5. **Incorrect space complexity.** The centroid finding algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), where n is the number of vertices in the tree. However, it is possible to implement the algorithm in such a way that it has a space complexity of O(log n).

CODEFORCES 750_F. New Year and Finding Roots

Pain points:
1. **Not flushing the output after printing the answer.** This is a common mistake that can lead to the "Idleness Limit Exceeded" verdict. To avoid this, make sure to flush the output after printing the answer.
2. **Not handling the case where `h = 0` or `k = 0`.** If the program reads `h = 0` or `k = 0`, it should immediately terminate normally. This is because the system detected incorrect input and printed 0. If the program does not handle this case, it could lead to a "Runtime Error", "Time/Memory limit exceeded", or any other verdict.
3. **Not handling the case where the tree is not a perfect binary tree.** The problem statement specifies that the tree must be a perfect binary tree. If the tree is not a perfect binary tree, the program will not be able to find the root.
4. **Not using the correct data structures.** The problem statement specifies that the tree must be represented as a perfect binary tree. This means that the tree must be represented as a binary tree where each node has exactly two children. If the tree is not represented as a perfect binary tree, the program will not be able to find the root.
5. **Making a mistake in the algorithm.** The algorithm for finding the root of a perfect binary tree is relatively simple. However, it is easy to make a mistake in the algorithm. Make sure to carefully review your algorithm before submitting it.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use a debugger to help you track down errors.
* Test your code on a variety of different inputs.
* Read the problem statement carefully and make sure you understand all of the requirements.
* Use the resources available to you, such as online forums and textbooks.

CODEFORCES 774_D. Lie or Truth

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program's execution. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect variable type**. The variable types used in the program may not be correct, which may lead to errors in the program's execution. For example, if a variable is declared as an integer but is assigned a string value, the program may crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program does not check for all possible cases, it may produce incorrect results.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when a programmer makes a mistake in counting, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if a programmer writes a loop that iterates over a list of numbers, but the loop starts at the wrong index, the program may skip some numbers or count them twice.
5. **Memory errors**. Memory errors occur when a program allocates more memory than it needs, or when it does not free up memory when it is no longer needed. Memory errors can lead to the program crashing or to incorrect results.
6. **Synchronization errors**. Synchronization errors occur when multiple threads in a program try to access the same data at the same time. Synchronization errors can lead to data corruption or to the program crashing.
7. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads in a program try to access the same data at the same time, and the outcome of the program depends on the order in which the threads access the data. Race conditions can lead to incorrect results or to the program crashing.
8. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads in a program are waiting for each other to release a resource, and neither thread can continue until the other thread releases the resource. Deadlocks can lead to the program crashing or to the program being stuck in an infinite loop.

Title:
CODEFORCES 865_D. Buy Low Sell High

Pain points:
**1. Mismatch between input and output format**

The input format specifies that the first line should contain an integer N, and the second line should contain a list of N integers. However, the example input contains 9 integers on the first line, and the example output contains 10 integers. This is a mismatch between the input and output format.

**2. Incorrect calculation of maximum profit**

The example input contains the following prices for each day: 10, 5, 4, 7, 9, 12, 6, 2, 10. The maximum profit that can be made from this sequence of prices is 20, which is achieved by buying a share on day 5, buying another share on day 4, selling one share on day 9, and selling another share on day 12. However, the example output contains 21, which is incorrect.

**3. Missing or incorrect boundary conditions**

The problem statement does not specify any boundary conditions. However, the example input contains a value of 0 for the number of days, which is outside the specified range of 2 ≤ N ≤ 3·105. Additionally, the example input contains a value of 107 for the price of one share of stock on day 1, which is also outside the specified range of 1 ≤ pi ≤ 106.

**4. Incorrect use of data types**

The problem statement specifies that the input and output should be integers. However, the example input contains the value 3.1 for the price of one share of stock on day 1, which is not an integer.

**5. Incorrect use of mathematical operators**

The problem statement specifies that the maximum profit should be calculated by subtracting the cost of buying shares from the revenue from selling shares. However, the example output contains 21, which is calculated by adding the cost of buying shares to the revenue from selling shares.

**6. Incorrect use of logical operators**

The problem statement specifies that the maximum profit should be calculated by finding the maximum difference between the prices of one share of stock on two consecutive days. However, the example output contains 21, which is calculated by finding the maximum sum of the prices of one share of stock on two consecutive days.

**7. Incorrect use of control flow statements**

The problem statement specifies that the maximum profit should be calculated by iterating through the list of prices of one share of stock and finding the maximum difference between the prices on two consecutive days. However, the example output contains 21, which is calculated by iterating through the list of prices of one share of stock and finding the maximum sum of the prices on two consecutive days.

**8. Incorrect use of functions**

The problem statement does not specify any functions that need to be used to solve the problem. However, the example output contains a function call to `max()`, which is not a function that is defined in the problem statement.

**9. Incorrect use of variables**

The problem statement does not specify any variables that need to be used to solve the problem. However, the example output contains a variable called `i`, which is not a variable that is defined in the problem statement.

**10. Incorrect use of constants**

The problem statement does not specify any constants that need to be used to solve the problem. However, the example output contains a constant called `N`, which is not a constant that is defined in the problem statement.

CODEFORCES 891_D. Sloth

Pain points:
 1. **Incorrect graph representation.** The input graph is a tree, but it may not be represented correctly in the code. For example, if the graph has 4 vertices and 3 edges, the input may be `[4, 1 2, 2 3, 1 3]`, which is not a tree.
2. **Incorrect definition of a perfect matching.** A perfect matching is a subset of edges such that each vertex is an endpoint of exactly one of these edges. In the example above, the edge `1 3` is not in the perfect matching, but it is an endpoint of two edges in the graph.
3. **Incorrect computation of the number of ways to remove an edge and then add an edge.** The number of ways to remove an edge and then add an edge is equal to the number of ways to remove an edge from the graph multiplied by the number of ways to add an edge to the graph. In the example above, the number of ways to remove an edge from the graph is 3, and the number of ways to add an edge to the graph is 4, so the total number of ways is 3 * 4 = 12.
4. **Incorrect output.** The output should be a single integer, which is the number of ways to remove an edge and then add an edge. In the example above, the output should be 12.

CODEFORCES 936_A. Save Energy!

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the parsing of the input data. For example, if the input contains spaces between the numbers, the program may interpret them as separate values.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the cooking time.** The cooking time is calculated by adding the time the chicken is cooked on the turned-on stove to the time it is cooked on the turned-off stove. However, it is important to take into account that the chicken is cooked at a different rate when the stove is turned on and off.
3. **Incorrect rounding of the cooking time.** The output should be rounded to the nearest 10-9th of a minute. This can be done using the `round()` function in Python.
4. **Incorrect error checking.** The checker program should check that the relative or absolute error between the submitted answer and the jury's answer does not exceed 10-9. This can be done using the `abs()` function in Python.
5. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.** Floating-point numbers are subject to rounding errors, which can lead to incorrect results. It is important to use the `round()` function to round floating-point numbers to the desired precision.
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect input format.**

```

```

This input is not in the correct format, as there is a space between the numbers. This may lead to errors in the parsing of the input data.

2. **Incorrect calculation of the cooking time.**

```
3 2 6
```

This input is correct, but the program incorrectly calculates the cooking time. The chicken is cooked for 3 minutes on the turned-on stove, after which it is cooked for 2 * 6 = 12 minutes on the turned-off stove. Therefore, the total cooking time is 3 + 12 = 15 minutes.

3. **Incorrect rounding of the cooking time.**

```
3 2 6
```

This input is correct, but the program incorrectly rounds the cooking time. The correct answer is 15.0, but the program rounds it to 15.

4. **Incorrect error checking.**

```
3 2 6
```

This input is correct, but the checker program incorrectly checks the error. The relative or absolute error between the submitted answer and the jury's answer is 0.0, but the checker program incorrectly reports an error.

5. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.**

```

Pain points:
 * 9-substring: -1 
  * 10-substring: -1 
  * 11-substring: -1
 **1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if the input contains a space between the number of characters and the string, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when printing the output. For example, if the output contains a newline character between the numbers, the program will crash.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the maximum length of an odd proper suprefix**

The maximum length of an odd proper suprefix can be calculated in different ways. For example, one way is to find all odd proper suprefixes of the string and then take the maximum length. Another way is to use a dynamic programming algorithm. If the wrong algorithm is used, the program will give the wrong answer.

**4. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

The problem statement does not specify how to handle edge cases. For example, what if the string is empty? Or what if the string contains only one character? If the program does not handle these edge cases correctly, it will crash.

**5. Incorrect use of data structures**

The program may crash if the wrong data structures are used. For example, if the program uses a linked list to store the odd proper suprefixes of the string, it will crash if the string is too long.

**6. Incorrect use of algorithms**

The program may crash if the wrong algorithms are used. For example, if the program uses a brute force algorithm to find all odd proper suprefixes of the string, it will crash if the string is too long.

HACKEREARTH anagrams-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect comparison of strings**. When comparing two strings, it is important to make sure that the strings are compared lexicographically. This means that the strings are compared character by character, starting with the first character in each string. If the first characters are different, then the string with the smaller character is considered to be less than the other string. If the first characters are the same, then the next characters are compared, and so on.
2. **Incorrect use of the `sort()` function**. The `sort()` function can be used to sort a list of items in ascending or descending order. However, it is important to make sure that the list of items is actually a list of strings. If the list of items is not a list of strings, then the `sort()` function will not work correctly.
3. **Incorrect use of the `join()` function**. The `join()` function can be used to join a list of strings into a single string. However, it is important to make sure that the list of strings is actually a list of strings. If the list of items is not a list of strings, then the `join()` function will not work correctly.
4. **Incorrect use of the `len()` function**. The `len()` function can be used to get the length of a string. However, it is important to make sure that the string is actually a string. If the string is not a string, then the `len()` function will not work correctly.
5. **Incorrect use of the `in` operator**. The `in` operator can be used to check if a value is contained in a list. However, it is important to make sure that the list is actually a list. If the list is not a list, then the `in` operator will not work correctly.
6. **Incorrect use of the `isalpha()` function**. The `isalpha()` function can be used to check if a character is a letter. However, it is important to make sure that the character is actually a character. If the character is not a character, then the `isalpha()` function will not work correctly.
7. **Incorrect use of the `islower()` function**. The `islower()` function can be used to check if a character is lowercase. However, it is important to make sure that the character is actually a character. If the character is not a character, then the `islower()` function will not work correctly.
8. **Incorrect use of the `isupper()` function**. The `isupper()` function can be used to check if a character is uppercase. However, it is important to make sure that the character is actually a character. If the character is not a character, then the `isupper()` function will not work correctly.
9. **Incorrect use of the `chr()` function**. The `chr()` function can be used to get the character represented by a given ASCII code. However, it is important to make sure that the ASCII code is actually a valid ASCII code. If the ASCII code is not a valid ASCII code, then the `chr()` function will not work correctly.
10. **Incorrect use of the `ord()` function**. The `ord()` function can be used to get the ASCII code represented by a given character. However, it is important to make sure that the character is actually a character. If the character is not a character, then the `ord()` function will not work correctly.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The input is a list of integers, but the code is expecting a list of strings. This can be fixed by changing the type of the input variable to `list(map(int, input().split()))`.
2. **Incorrect comparison:** The code is comparing the sum of the weights of the stones to the maximum lifting capacity of the crane, but this is incorrect. The correct comparison is to compare the maximum lifting capacity of the crane to the weight of the heaviest stone. This can be fixed by changing the comparison to `max(stones) <= M`.
3. **Off-by-one error:** The code is adding one to the number of turns required to lift the stones, but this is incorrect. The correct number of turns is the number of stones divided by two, rounded up. This can be fixed by changing the code to `turns = math.ceil(len(stones) / 2)`.
4. **Unnecessary variable:** The code is using a variable called `i` to iterate over the list of stones, but this variable is not used anywhere else in the code. This variable can be removed without changing the functionality of the code.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def main():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        M = int(input())
        stones = list(map(int, input().split()))
        turns = math.ceil(len(stones) / 2)
        print(turns)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The variable `n` should be of type `int`, but it is of type `str`.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator**. The operator `!=` should be used to check if two values are not equal, but the operator `<` is used in the code.
3. **Incorrect indentation**. The code is not properly indented, which makes it difficult to read and understand.
4. **Missing curly braces**. The curly braces around the condition in the `if` statement are missing.
5. **Incorrect logic**. The logic in the `if` statement is incorrect. It should check if the first character of the string is `/` and the last character is `\`, but it checks if the first character is `\` and the last character is `/`.

HACKEREARTH geeky-alice-and-naughty-bob

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect factorial calculation**

The factorial function in Python is defined as `math.factorial(n)`. However, this function only works for positive integers. If you try to calculate the factorial of a negative number, you will get an error.

To avoid this problem, you can use the following function to calculate the factorial of a negative number:

```python
def factorial(n):
  if n < 0:
    return 0
  else:
    return math.factorial(n)
```

**2. Incorrect range check**

When you are iterating over a range of numbers, you need to make sure that the range is valid. For example, if you are iterating over the range `[1, 3]`, you need to make sure that `1 <= i <= 3` for all values of `i`.

To avoid this problem, you can use the following code to check the validity of a range:

```python
def is_valid_range(start, end):
  return start <= end
```

**3. Incorrect sum calculation**

When you are summing a series of numbers, you need to make sure that you are adding the numbers in the correct order. For example, if you are summing the numbers `[1, 2, 3]`, you need to add them in the order `1 + 2 + 3`.

To avoid this problem, you can use the following code to sum a series of numbers:

```python
def sum_numbers(numbers):
  total = 0
  for number in numbers:
    total += number
  return total
```

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain a string instead of an integer. The developer should check the input format and handle the incorrect input format gracefully.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be in the wrong data type. For example, the input may contain a floating-point number instead of an integer. The developer should check the data type of the input and convert it to the correct data type.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may make an off-by-one error when calculating the output. For example, the developer may calculate the output as 23 instead of 24. The developer should carefully check the code to avoid off-by-one errors.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program. For example, the developer may assume that the input data is always correct. The developer should carefully check the logic of the program to avoid incorrect logic.
5. **Memory leak**. The developer may not release the memory that is allocated during the execution of the program. This can lead to a memory leak. The developer should release the memory that is allocated as soon as it is no longer needed.
6. **Race condition**. The developer may not handle race conditions correctly. A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same resource at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results. The developer should use locks to prevent race conditions.
7. **Deadlock**. The developer may create a deadlock in the program. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can cause the program to hang. The developer should avoid creating deadlocks.

3. **Off-by-one error.** The developer may forget to add 1 to the number of bridges crossed, as the monk starts on island 1.
4. **Memory leak.** The developer may not free the memory allocated for the input data, which could lead to a memory leak.
5. **Incorrect output format.** The developer may not format the output correctly, which could make it difficult to read.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input data, verify the logic, and test the code thoroughly.

Title:
HACKEREARTH permutation-again

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong formula**

The formula for finding the maximum sum of difference of adjacent elements in all arrangement of numbers from 1 to N is:

```
max_sum = (N * (N + 1)) / 2
```

However, some developers may mistakenly use the following formula:

```
max_sum = (N * (N - 1)) / 2
```

This will result in an incorrect answer.

**2. Not considering the case where N is odd**

The formula for finding the maximum sum of difference of adjacent elements in all arrangement of numbers from 1 to N only works when N is even. If N is odd, then the maximum sum of difference of adjacent elements will be less than the value of the formula.

**3. Using a brute-force approach**

A brute-force approach to solving this problem would be to generate all possible arrangements of numbers from 1 to N and then calculate the maximum sum of difference of adjacent elements for each arrangement. This would be very time-consuming and inefficient.

**4. Not using the fact that the maximum sum of difference of adjacent elements is always achieved when the numbers are in descending order**

The maximum sum of difference of adjacent elements is always achieved when the numbers are in descending order. This means that we can simply sort the numbers from 1 to N and then calculate the sum of the differences between each pair of adjacent elements. This will give us the maximum possible value.

**5. Not handling negative numbers correctly**

The formula for finding the maximum sum of difference of adjacent elements in all arrangement of numbers from 1 to N does not work correctly for negative numbers. This is because the absolute value of a negative number is greater than the number itself. For example, the absolute value of -5 is 5, which is greater than 5. This means that if we use the formula to calculate the maximum sum of difference of adjacent elements for a list of negative numbers, we will get an incorrect answer.

**6. Not handling duplicate numbers correctly**

The formula for finding the maximum sum of difference of adjacent elements in all arrangement of numbers from 1 to N does not work correctly for lists that contain duplicate numbers. This is because the absolute value of the difference between two duplicate numbers is 0, which is less than the value of the formula. For example, the absolute value of the difference between 1 and 1 is 0, which is less than (1 * (1 + 1)) / 2 = 1.5. This means that if we use the formula to calculate the maximum sum of difference of adjacent elements for a list of duplicate numbers, we will get an incorrect answer.

HACKEREARTH studious-little-jhool

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The variable `n` should be of type `int`, but it is of type `str`. This will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect operator:** The operator `%` is used to find the remainder of a division. However, in this problem, we need to find the quotient of a division. To do this, we can use the operator `//`.
3. **Incorrect logic:** The program checks if `n % 10 == 0`. However, this condition is not sufficient to determine if `n` is divisible by 10. We also need to check if `n % 12 == 0`.
4. **Incorrect output:** The program prints the value of `n` instead of the minimum number of pages that Little Jhool needs to tear out.

To fix these problems, we can make the following changes to the program:

1. Change the variable `n` to be of type `int`.
2. Change the operator `%` to `//`.
3. Add an additional check to see if `n % 12 == 0`.
4. Print the minimum number of pages that Little Jhool needs to tear out, instead of the value of `n`.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def main():
    t = int(input())

        if n % 10 == 0 or n % 12 == 0:

Title:
ATCODER p03003 AtCoder Beginner Contest 130 - Common Subsequence

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is given as two integers N and M, followed by N integers representing S and M integers representing T. If you use the wrong data type to store these integers, you may get unexpected results. For example, if you use `int` to store N and M, you may get an overflow error when N or M is large.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks for the number of pairs of a subsequence of S and a subsequence of T such that the subsequences are the same in content. A naive solution is to enumerate all possible subsequences of S and T, and check if each pair of subsequences is the same in content. This solution has a time complexity of O(N^2M^2), which is too slow for large values of N and M.

A more efficient solution is to use dynamic programming. Let `dp[i][j]` be the number of pairs of a subsequence of S[1..i] and a subsequence of T[1..j] such that the subsequences are the same in content. Then, we can compute `dp[i][j]` as follows:

```
dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] - dp[i - 1][j - 1]
```

where the first term represents the number of pairs where the last element of the subsequence of S is equal to the last element of the subsequence of T, the second term represents the number of pairs where the last element of the subsequence of S is not equal to the last element of the subsequence of T but the subsequence of S is a suffix of the subsequence of T, and the third term represents the number of pairs where the last element of the subsequence of S is not equal to the last element of the subsequence of T and the subsequence of T is a suffix of the subsequence of S.

**3. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

When using dynamic programming, it is important to use the correct boundary conditions. For this problem, the boundary conditions are as follows:

```
dp[0][0] = 1
dp[i][0] = 0 for all i > 0
dp[0][j] = 0 for all j > 0
```

**4. Off-by-one errors**

It is easy to make off-by-one errors when using dynamic programming. For example, in the above recurrence relation for `dp[i][j]`, it is important to subtract `dp[i - 1][j - 1]` from the sum of the other terms. If you forget to do this, you will get an incorrect answer.

**5. Incorrect modulo arithmetic**

When computing the answer to this problem, it is important to use the correct modulo arithmetic. The problem states that the answer should be printed modulo `10^9+7`. This means that you need to perform all arithmetic operations modulo `10^9+7`. For example, if you add two numbers that are both modulo `10^9+7`, you need to take the remainder of the sum when divided by `10^9+7`.

**6. Using floating-point arithmetic**

It is important to avoid using floating-point arithmetic when solving this problem. Floating-point arithmetic is not precise, and can lead to incorrect results. For this problem, you should use integer arithmetic.

Title:
ATCODER p03287 AtCoder Beginner Contest 105 - Candy Distribution

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The problem states that the number of candies in each box can be up to 10^9, but the input format uses integers, which can only store numbers up to 2^31 - 1. This can lead to overflow errors if the number of candies in a box is too large.

**2. Not considering the case where M is greater than the total number of candies**

The problem states that M must be at least 2, but the input format does not check for this. If M is greater than the total number of candies, then there will be no pairs of boxes that satisfy the conditions.

**3. Using incorrect algorithms**

The problem can be solved using a simple dynamic programming algorithm. However, if the input data is large, this algorithm can be slow. A more efficient algorithm can be used by first sorting the candies in each box and then using a divide-and-conquer approach.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

The problem has a few edge cases that need to be handled. For example, if N is 1, then there is only one possible pair of boxes (1, 1). Similarly, if M is equal to the number of candies in a box, then there will be no pairs of boxes that satisfy the conditions.

**5. Not testing the code thoroughly**

It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly for all possible inputs. This includes testing for incorrect data types, overflow errors, and edge cases.

ATCODER p03603 AtCoder Regular Contest 083 - Bichrome Tree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the DFS traversal.** The DFS traversal is a recursive algorithm that visits all vertices of a graph in a depth-first order. In this problem, we need to use DFS to visit all vertices of the tree and check if the condition is satisfied for each vertex. A common mistake is to implement the DFS traversal incorrectly, which may lead to incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the total weight of the vertices with the same color as v.** The total weight of the vertices with the same color as v is the sum of the weights of all vertices in the subtree whose root is v that have the same color as v. A common mistake is to incorrectly calculate the total weight of the vertices with the same color as v, which may lead to incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect handling of the case where the tree is not a binary tree.** The problem statement states that the tree is a binary tree. However, a binary tree is a tree in which each vertex has at most two children. In this problem, it is possible that the tree is not a binary tree, which means that some vertices may have more than two children. A common mistake is to incorrectly handle the case where the tree is not a binary tree, which may lead to incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect handling of the case where the condition is not satisfied.** The condition is that the total weight of the vertices with the same color as v is equal to X_v. A common mistake is to incorrectly handle the case where the condition is not satisfied, which may lead to incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect output.** The output of the program should be either `POSSIBLE` or `IMPOSSIBLE`. A common mistake is to incorrectly output the results, which may lead to the program being incorrect.

y_1 y_2 ... y_m`. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The input data is given as integers. If the input data is not in the correct data type, the program will not be able to correctly process the data and will likely produce incorrect results.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When computing the area of a rectangle, it is important to make sure that the correct indices are used. For example, if the rectangle is defined by the points `(x_1, y_1)`, `(x_2, y_2)`, `(x_3, y_3)`, and `(x_4, y_4)`, the area of the rectangle is given by `(x_2 - x_1) * (y_4 - y_1)`. However, if the indices are off by one, the area of the rectangle will be incorrect.

**4. Floating-point errors**

When computing the area of a rectangle, it is important to make sure that the calculations are done with enough precision. If the calculations are not done with enough precision, the results will be incorrect.

**5. Memory leaks**

The program should be careful to free any memory that it allocates. If the program does not free the memory that it allocates, the memory will eventually be exhausted and the program will crash.
