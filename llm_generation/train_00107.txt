CODECHEF cds002

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input `n` is an integer, but the code uses `str(n)` to convert it to a string. This will cause an error.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The code calculates the number of cookies in the jar as `n * (n + 1) + 1`, but this is incorrect. The correct calculation is `n * (n + 1) + 2`.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The code prints the number of cookies in the jar as `print(n * (n + 1) + 1)`, but this is one less than the correct answer. The correct output should be `print(n * (n + 1) + 2)`.
4. **Uninitialized variable**. The code uses the variable `total` without initializing it, which will cause an error.
5. **Infinite loop**. The code contains an infinite loop, which will cause the program to crash. The loop can be fixed by adding a condition to check if `n` is equal to 0.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def main():
    # Get the number of test cases.
    n = int(input())

    # Loop through the test cases.
    for _ in range(n):
        # Get the number of children.
        n = int(input())

        # Calculate the number of cookies in the jar.
        total = n * (n + 1) + 2

        # Print the output.
        print(total)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Title:
CODECHEF cw5

Pain points:
Example case 2. Penny's King has no escape route. So, this is a checkmate. ```
1. **Incorrect board representation**. The input board should be represented as a 8x8 2D array, where each element is a character representing a piece on the board. For example, `"_P_S_"` represents a board with Penny's King at `(1, 4)` and Sheldon's King at `(5, 4)`.
2. **Incorrect piece representation**. The pieces should be represented by the following characters:
    * `P` for Penny's King
    * `S` for Sheldon's King
    * `Q` for Sheldon's Queen
    * `R` for Sheldon's Rook
    * `B` for Sheldon's Bishop
    Any other character in the input board will be considered as an empty space.
3. **Incorrect checkmate detection**. A checkmate occurs when the King is in check and there are no legal moves that can be made to escape check. A legal move is any move that does not put the King in check.
4. **Incomplete code**. The code should be complete and should handle all possible cases. For example, the code should handle the case where Penny's King is in checkmate.
5. **Incorrect output**. The output should be either `"CHECKMATE!"` or `"NOT YET!"`.

Title:
CODECHEF icq2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly converting the input number to binary.** The input number may be very large, so it is important to use a correct method to convert it to binary. One common mistake is to use the `bin()` function in Python, which only returns the first 32 bits of the number. To get the full binary representation, you can use the `int()` function with the `base=2` argument.
2. **Using an incorrect algorithm to count the trailing zeros.** The most common algorithm for counting trailing zeros is to repeatedly divide the number by 2 until the result is less than 2. However, this algorithm can be inefficient for large numbers, as it requires multiple divisions. A more efficient algorithm is to use the following formula:

```
trailing_zeros = floor(log2(n))
```

where `log2()` is the logarithm base 2.
3. **Incorrectly handling negative numbers.** The binary representation of a negative number is not the same as the binary representation of its absolute value. When counting the trailing zeros of a negative number, it is important to first convert it to its absolute value.
4. **Not handling overflows.** When dividing a large number by 2, it is possible to get an overflow. This can cause the algorithm to crash or produce incorrect results. To avoid this, it is important to check for overflows and handle them appropriately.
5. **Not handling special cases.** There are a few special cases that need to be handled when counting trailing zeros. For example, the number 0 has no trailing zeros, and the number 1 has one trailing zero. It is important to handle these cases correctly in order to avoid errors.

Title:
CODECHEF mriu2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may incorrectly implement the logic to check if a number is a circular prime. For example, they may check if the number is prime, but not check if the number generated at each intermediate step when cyclically permuting its digits is also prime.
2. **Incorrect input/output format**. The developer may incorrectly parse the input or format the output. For example, they may not correctly handle numbers that are greater than 100000.
3. **Runtime errors**. The developer may make a mistake that causes the program to run into a runtime error. For example, they may divide by zero or attempt to access an invalid memory address.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer may create a memory leak, which is when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
5. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer may introduce a security vulnerability, such as a buffer overflow or a SQL injection vulnerability. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the program or the system it is running on.

Title:
CODECHEF rgame

Pain points:
There are 3 possible gameplays. A1A2A1 which gives score of 2 * 1 * 1 = 2, A2A1A2 which gives score of 2 * 1 * 1 = 2 and A1A2A2 which gives score of 2 * 1 * 2 = 4. So the answer is 2 + 2 + 4 = 14. **Possible Problems and Bugs**

1. **Incorrect Modulo Operation**

When calculating the sum of scores, it is important to remember to perform the modulo operation after each addition. Otherwise, the answer may overflow.

2. **Incorrect Indexing**

When iterating through the array of numbers, it is important to make sure that the indices are correct. Otherwise, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

3. **Off-by-one Errors**

When calculating the scores, it is important to make sure that the indices are correct. Otherwise, the program may calculate the wrong score or produce incorrect results.

4. **Incorrect Data Types**

When storing the numbers in the array, it is important to use the correct data type. Otherwise, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

5. **Incorrect Assumptions**

When writing the program, it is important to make sure that all of the assumptions are correct. Otherwise, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

6. **Incorrect Implementation**

The implementation of the program is critical to the correctness of the results. It is important to make sure that the program is implemented correctly. Otherwise, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

Title:
CODECHEF uaseq

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data is given as two integers N and K, followed by a list of N integers. The integers in the input list can be very large, so it is important to use the correct data types to store them. For example, if you use `int` to store the integers in the input list, you may encounter overflow errors when the integers are too large.

**2. Using incorrect algorithms**

The problem can be solved using a variety of algorithms. However, some algorithms may be more efficient than others. For example, a brute-force algorithm that tries all possible combinations of K elements from the input list will be very inefficient. A more efficient algorithm would be to use a greedy algorithm that tries to find the most beautiful arithmetic progression with at most K changes.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement specifies that the input data will always contain at least one arithmetic progression under the constraints of the problem. However, it is possible that the input data will contain an arithmetic progression that is not the most beautiful. In this case, the algorithm should still output the most beautiful arithmetic progression that it can find.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output of the program should be a single line containing the resulting array with at most K changes. The elements of the array should be separated by spaces.

**5. Missing error handling**

The program should handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input data is invalid, the program should print an error message and exit.

CODEFORCES 1019_C. Sergey's problem

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly and in the correct format. For example, if you are using `scanf` to read the input, you need to make sure that you are using the correct format specifiers.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also very specific. It is important to make sure that you are printing the output in the correct format. For example, you need to make sure that you are printing the number of vertices in the set first, followed by the indices of the vertices.

**3. Undefined behavior**

Some of the code in your solution may cause undefined behavior. This can happen if you are using uninitialized variables, or if you are dereferencing a null pointer. It is important to make sure that your code does not cause undefined behavior, as this can lead to unexpected results.

**4. Memory leaks**

Your solution may also cause memory leaks. This can happen if you are not freeing memory that you have allocated, or if you are allocating memory that you do not need. It is important to make sure that your solution does not cause memory leaks, as this can lead to your program running out of memory.

**5. Runtime errors**

Your solution may also cause runtime errors. This can happen if you are dividing by zero, or if you are accessing an array out of bounds. It is important to make sure that your solution does not cause runtime errors, as this can lead to your program crashing.

**6. Incorrect solution**

Even if your code does not contain any of the above problems, it is still possible that your solution is incorrect. This can happen if you have made a mistake in your logic, or if you have misunderstood the problem statement. It is important to carefully check your solution to make sure that it is correct.

CODEFORCES 1133_F1. Spanning Tree with Maximum Degree

Pain points:
**1. The input graph may not be connected.**

If the input graph is not connected, then there is no spanning tree. In this case, the program should output ```-1```.

**2. The input graph may contain self-loops or multiple edges.**

If the input graph contains self-loops or multiple edges, then the program should output ```-1```.

**3. The input graph may not be a tree.**

A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. If the input graph contains a cycle, then it is not a tree. In this case, the program should output ```-1```.

**4. The output spanning tree may not be a tree.**

A spanning tree is a subgraph of a graph that is a tree and that includes all of the vertices of the graph. If the output spanning tree contains a cycle, then it is not a tree. In this case, the program should output ```-1```.

**5. The output spanning tree may not have the maximum possible degree.**

The maximum degree of a vertex in a spanning tree is the number of edges that are incident to the vertex. The maximum degree over all vertices in a spanning tree is the maximum of the maximum degrees of all vertices in the spanning tree. If the output spanning tree does not have the maximum possible degree, then the program should output ```-1```.

**6. The output spanning tree may not be a subset of the input edges.**

The edges of the output spanning tree must be a subset of the input edges. In other words, each edge in the output spanning tree must also be an edge in the input graph. If the output spanning tree is not a subset of the input edges, then the program should output ```-1```.

**7. The output spanning tree may not be in the correct order.**

The edges of the output spanning tree must be printed in the correct order. The order of the edges does not matter, but the edges must be printed in such a way that it is possible to reconstruct the spanning tree from the output. If the output spanning tree is not in the correct order, then the program should output ```-1```.

CODEFORCES 1154_C. Gourmet Cat

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of three integers. However, the developer may incorrectly parse the input data as a string and then try to convert it to an integer. This will result in a ValueError.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of days**

The maximum number of days is the minimum of the three values a, b, and c. However, the developer may incorrectly calculate the maximum number of days by adding the three values together. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**3. Off-by-one error**

When calculating the maximum number of days, the developer may forget to subtract 1 from the maximum number of days. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**4. Infinite loop**

The developer may incorrectly write the following code:

```
while True:
    # Do something
```

This will result in an infinite loop.

**5. Memory leak**

The developer may incorrectly create a new object every time the code is executed. This will result in a memory leak.

**6. Race condition**

The developer may incorrectly access a shared resource without locking it. This will result in a race condition.

CODEFORCES 1176_A. Divide it!

Pain points:
```
1. **Incorrect logic**. A common mistake is to incorrectly apply the operations. For example, you might think that you can replace 30 with 20 using the first operation, but this is not correct because 30 is not divisible by 2.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. Another common mistake is to make an off-by-one error when counting the number of moves required. For example, you might think that it takes 4 moves to get from 10 to 1, but this is not correct because you can actually do it in 3 moves by replacing 10 with 5 using the third operation, then replacing 5 with 2 using the second operation, and then replacing 2 with 1 using the first operation.
3. **Incorrect data types**. It is important to use the correct data types when working with large numbers. For example, if you try to store a number larger than 2^31-1 in a 32-bit integer, you will get an incorrect result.
4. **Memory errors**. If you are not careful, you can run out of memory when solving this problem. This is especially likely if you are using a recursive solution.
5. **Time complexity**. Your solution should have a time complexity of O(log n) or better. This is because the number of moves required to get from n to 1 is at most log n.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1194_G. Another Meme Problem

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the modulo operator.**

The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 = 1. However, if the dividend is negative, the modulo operator returns the remainder of the absolute value of the dividend divided by the divisor. For example, -10 % 3 = 2. This can lead to incorrect results if the dividend is negative and the divisor is greater than 1.

**2. Using the wrong modulo operation.**

The modulo operator (%) is often used to perform arithmetic operations on integers that are larger than the size of the integer type. However, the modulo operator only works correctly if the dividend is less than or equal to the divisor. If the dividend is greater than the divisor, the modulo operator will return an incorrect result.

**3. Using the modulo operator with floating-point numbers.**

The modulo operator (%) cannot be used with floating-point numbers. If you try to use the modulo operator with a floating-point number, you will get a compiler error.

**4. Using the modulo operator with strings.**

The modulo operator (%) cannot be used with strings. If you try to use the modulo operator with a string, you will get a compiler error.

**5. Using the modulo operator with arrays.**

The modulo operator (%) cannot be used with arrays. If you try to use the modulo operator with an array, you will get a compiler error.

**6. Using the modulo operator with objects.**

The modulo operator (%) cannot be used with objects. If you try to use the modulo operator with an object, you will get a compiler error.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1320_A. Journey Planning

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem states that "for any pair of adjacent cities c_i and c_{i + 1}, the condition c_{i + 1} - c_i = b_{c_{i + 1}} - b_{c_i} must hold". This means that the difference between the indices of two adjacent cities must be equal to the difference between their beauty values. For example, if the beauty values of two cities are 10 and 15, then the difference between their indices must be 5. A common mistake is to assume that the difference between the indices of two adjacent cities must be less than or equal to the difference between their beauty values. This is not true in general. For example, if the beauty values of two cities are 10 and 15, then the difference between their indices could be 6.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution to this problem involves finding the maximum sum of beauty values over all possible subsequences of the given array. A common mistake is to use a brute-force approach to solve this problem. This approach would involve iterating over all possible subsequences of the array and computing the sum of beauty values for each subsequence. This approach is very inefficient and would not be able to solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time.
3. **Incorrect testing of the solution.** It is important to test the solution to this problem thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. A common mistake is to only test the solution on a few small test cases. This is not enough to ensure that the solution is correct. The solution should be tested on a variety of test cases, including both small and large test cases.
4. **Incorrect debugging of the solution.** If the solution does not pass all of the test cases, it is important to be able to debug the solution to find the source of the error. A common mistake is to try to debug the solution without first understanding the problem. It is important to understand the problem before trying to debug the solution. This will make it much easier to find the source of the error.
5. **Incorrect submission of the solution.** Once the solution has been debugged and tested, it is important to submit the solution to the competition. A common mistake is to forget to submit the solution. It is also important to make sure that the solution is submitted in the correct format.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1381_A2. Prefix Flip (Hard Version)

Pain points:
**1. Incorrectly counting the number of operations required.**

The most common mistake when solving this problem is to incorrectly count the number of operations required. For example, if you have a string `a` of length `n` and you want to transform it into a string `b` of length `n`, you might think that you need to perform `n` operations. However, this is not always the case. In fact, you can often transform `a` into `b` in fewer than `n` operations.

To correctly count the number of operations required, you need to consider the following factors:

* The length of the strings `a` and `b`.
* The number of mismatches between `a` and `b`.
* The locations of the mismatches in `a`.

Once you have considered these factors, you can use a dynamic programming algorithm to find the minimum number of operations required to transform `a` into `b`.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm.**

Another common mistake when solving this problem is to use an incorrect algorithm. For example, you might try to use a brute force algorithm to solve the problem. However, this will quickly become inefficient as the length of the strings `a` and `b` increases.

Instead, you should use a dynamic programming algorithm to solve the problem. A dynamic programming algorithm will take advantage of the fact that the optimal solution to the problem can be decomposed into smaller subproblems. This will allow you to solve the problem in a much more efficient way.

**3. Not handling special cases correctly.**

There are a few special cases that you need to handle correctly when solving this problem. For example, you need to handle the case where the strings `a` and `b` are equal. You also need to handle the case where the strings `a` and `b` are not equal, but they have the same length.

If you do not handle these special cases correctly, your solution will not be correct.

**4. Not testing your code thoroughly.**

Finally, it is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it. This will help you to identify any bugs in your code and to fix them before it is too late.

To test your code, you can use a variety of different methods. For example, you can use a unit testing framework to test your code individually. You can also use a black box testing framework to test your code as a whole.

By testing your code thoroughly, you can help to ensure that it is correct and that it will work correctly on all inputs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1445_E. Team-Building

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two integers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when printing the output. For example, if you forget to add a newline character at the end of the output, the program will not produce the correct output.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over a list or array, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one element or count one element twice. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect use of pointers.** Pointers are a powerful tool, but they can also be dangerous if used incorrectly. For example, if you dereference a pointer that is not pointing to a valid memory location, the program will crash.
5. **Memory leaks.** When a program allocates memory, it is important to free that memory when it is no longer needed. If a program does not free memory that it has allocated, it will eventually run out of memory and crash.
6. **Race conditions.** When multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is possible for them to interfere with each other. This can lead to incorrect results or even a program crash.
7. **Deadlocks.** When two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, they can deadlock. This means that the program will be stuck in a state where no progress can be made.
8. **Unhandled exceptions.** When a program encounters an error, it should handle the error gracefully. If a program does not handle an error, it will crash.
9. **Security vulnerabilities.** A program can be vulnerable to security attacks if it is not properly written. For example, a program that does not properly validate user input can be tricked into executing arbitrary code.

* **Runtime errors.** These can be caused by a variety of factors, such as running out of memory, accessing invalid memory, or dividing by zero.
* **Time complexity issues.** The algorithm may take too long to run, especially for large inputs. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as using inefficient algorithms or data structures, or using too much recursion.
* **Memory usage issues.** The algorithm may use too much memory, especially for large inputs. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as using inefficient algorithms or data structures, or not freeing memory when it is no longer needed.

**How to avoid these problems:**

* **Test your code thoroughly.** This is the best way to catch errors in your implementation. Make sure to test your code with a variety of inputs, including both valid and invalid inputs.
* **Use the correct data types.** Make sure to use the correct data types for input and output. For example, if you are reading an integer from the input, you should use the `int` data type.
* **Escape special characters correctly.** When printing output, make sure to escape special characters correctly. For example, if you want to print a double quote, you should use `\"`.
* **Handle runtime errors gracefully.** If your algorithm encounters a runtime error, it should handle the error gracefully and return an appropriate error code.
* **Optimize your algorithm.** If your algorithm is taking too long to run, you should try to optimize it. This can be done by using more efficient algorithms or data structures, or by reducing the amount of recursion.
* **Monitor your memory usage.** If your algorithm is using too much memory, you should try to reduce your memory usage. This can be done by using more efficient algorithms or data structures, or by freeing memory when it is no longer needed.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain a non-integer number, or it may contain two space-separated integers instead of one. The developer should check the input format and handle incorrect input gracefully.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correct. For example, the output may contain a non-integer number, or it may not be formatted correctly. The developer should check the output format and handle incorrect output gracefully.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program. For example, the developer may not correctly calculate the maximum size of the group, or the developer may not correctly handle the case where the leader of the group has an age that is too different from the age of the other members of the group. The developer should carefully check the logic of the program and make sure that it is correct.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer may not correctly free up memory that is allocated during the execution of the program. This can lead to memory leaks, which can eventually cause the program to crash. The developer should carefully track the memory that is allocated and free up memory that is no longer needed.
5. **Race conditions**. The developer may not correctly synchronize access to shared data. This can lead to race conditions, which can cause the program to produce incorrect results or to crash. The developer should carefully synchronize access to shared data to avoid race conditions.
6. **Deadlocks**. The developer may not correctly handle deadlocks. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely. The developer should carefully handle deadlocks to avoid this problem.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer may not correctly implement security features. This can lead to security vulnerabilities, which can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or to the data that the program is processing. The developer should carefully implement security features to protect the program and the data that it is processing.

CODEFORCES 28_D. Don't fear, DravDe is kind

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that the input is in the correct format, or the program will not be able to process it correctly. For example, if the input contains a line that is not in the correct format, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is also very specific. It is important to make sure that the output is in the correct format, or the program will not be able to produce the correct answer. For example, if the output does not contain the correct number of lines, or if the lines are not in the correct order, the program will not be correct.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve the problem must be correct in order for the program to produce the correct answer. There are a number of ways to solve this problem, but not all of them are correct. For example, an algorithm that simply removes the trucks with the lowest values will not be correct, because it is possible that the trucks with the lowest values are the ones that are needed to keep the other trucks from being eaten by DravDe.

**4. Runtime errors**

The program must be able to run to completion in a reasonable amount of time. If the program takes too long to run, it will not be able to solve the problem in a timely manner. There are a number of things that can cause runtime errors, such as inefficient algorithms, incorrect data structures, and memory leaks.

**5. Memory leaks**

The program must not leak memory. If the program leaks memory, it will eventually run out of memory and crash. There are a number of ways to prevent memory leaks, such as using reference counting and garbage collection.

**6. Incorrect data structures**

The program must use the correct data structures to store the input data and the output data. If the program uses incorrect data structures, it will not be able to solve the problem correctly. For example, if the program uses a linked list to store the input data, it will not be able to efficiently find the trucks that need to be removed.

**7. Incorrect logic**

The program must use correct logic to solve the problem. If the program uses incorrect logic, it will not be able to solve the problem correctly. For example, if the program assumes that all of the trucks are afraid of DravDe, it will not be able to solve the problem correctly.

**8. Incorrect implementation**

The program must be correctly implemented in order to solve the problem correctly. If the program is not correctly implemented, it will not be able to solve the problem correctly. For example, if the program uses the wrong variable names or the wrong data types, it will not be able to solve the problem correctly.

CODEFORCES 315_D. Sereja and Periods

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format should be exactly as specified in the problem statement. For example, if the problem statement says that the input should be two integers separated by a space, then entering the integers in any other way (e.g., with a comma instead of a space) will result in an incorrect input format error.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format should be exactly as specified in the problem statement. For example, if the problem statement says that the output should be a single integer, then outputting anything else (e.g., a string) will result in an incorrect output format error.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over a list or string, it is easy to make an off-by-one error, which can result in the incorrect answer. For example, if you are iterating over a list of integers and you accidentally start at index 1 instead of index 0, you will miss the first element of the list.
4. **Indexing errors.** When accessing elements of a list or string, it is easy to make an indexing error, which can result in the incorrect answer. For example, if you try to access the element at index 10 of a list that only has 9 elements, you will get an IndexError.
5. **Arithmetic errors.** When performing arithmetic operations, it is easy to make a mistake, which can result in the incorrect answer. For example, if you accidentally divide by zero, you will get a ZeroDivisionError.
6. **Logical errors.** When writing your code, it is easy to make a logical error, which can result in the incorrect answer. For example, if you assume that a condition is true when it is actually false, you will get the wrong answer.
7. **Runtime errors.** When your code runs, it is possible for it to encounter an error that causes it to stop running. For example, if your code tries to access a memory location that does not exist, it will get a MemoryError.

CODEFORCES 454_C. Little Pony and Expected Maximum

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correctly parsed. For example, if the input contains two integers separated by a space, the second integer may be interpreted as a float instead of an integer. This can lead to incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the expected value**

The expected value of a random variable is the sum of the product of each possible outcome and its probability. For example, if the random variable X can take on the values 1, 2, and 3 with probabilities 0.2, 0.5, and 0.3, respectively, then the expected value of X is (1 * 0.2) + (2 * 0.5) + (3 * 0.3) = 2.5.

However, it is possible to make a mistake when calculating the expected value. For example, if you forget to multiply each outcome by its probability, you will get the wrong answer.

**3. Incorrect rounding of the answer**

The answer to the problem should be rounded to a certain number of decimal places. For example, if the answer is 3.141592653589793, it should be rounded to 3.1416.

**4. Incorrect use of floating-point numbers**

Floating-point numbers are not always accurate. For example, the floating-point number 0.1 cannot be represented exactly in binary. This can lead to rounding errors when performing calculations with floating-point numbers.

**5. Incorrect use of the expectation function**

The expectation function is a mathematical function that calculates the expected value of a random variable. However, it is possible to make a mistake when using the expectation function. For example, if you forget to specify the domain of the random variable, you will get the wrong answer.

**6. Incorrect use of the probability function**

The probability function is a mathematical function that calculates the probability of a certain event occurring. However, it is possible to make a mistake when using the probability function. For example, if you forget to specify the sample space, you will get the wrong answer.

CODEFORCES 477_A. Dreamoon and Sums

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**

The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. For example, 10 % 3 = 1. However, in this problem, we need to find the remainder of a division modulo 1000000007. So we need to use the following operator: ```
(a % m) % mod
```

**2. Using the wrong formula**

The formula for the sum of all nice integers is:

```
(a * (a + 1) / 2) % mod
```

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When calculating the sum of all nice integers, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, if we are calculating the sum of all integers from 1 to 10, we might accidentally include 10 in the sum.

**4. Using the wrong data type**

When calculating the sum of all nice integers, it is important to use a data type that is large enough to store the result. For example, if we are calculating the sum of all integers from 1 to 1000000000, we need to use a data type that can store integers up to 1000000000.

**5. Not using enough precision**

When calculating the sum of all nice integers, it is important to use enough precision to avoid rounding errors. For example, if we are calculating the sum of all integers from 1 to 1000000000, we need to use at least 10 digits of precision.

CODEFORCES 525_A. Vitaliy and Pie

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrectly identifying the input format.** The input format for this problem is a bit tricky, so it's important to make sure you understand it correctly before you start writing your code. The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105), which is the number of rooms in the house. The second line of the input contains a string s of length 2·n - 2. The odd positions in the string s contain lowercase Latin letters, which are the types of the keys that lie in the corresponding rooms. The even positions in the string s contain uppercase Latin letters, which are the types of the doors between the rooms.
* **Incorrectly storing the input data.** Once you've identified the input format, you need to store the input data in a way that you can access it easily in your code. The easiest way to do this is to create two arrays, one for the keys and one for the doors. The keys array should contain the lowercase Latin letters from the input string, and the doors array should contain the uppercase Latin letters from the input string.
* **Incorrectly using the input data.** Once you've stored the input data, you need to use it to solve the problem. The key to solving this problem is to find the minimum number of keys that Vitaly needs to buy to get from room one to room n. To do this, you need to iterate through the keys array and the doors array, and keep track of the number of keys that you need to buy.
* **Incorrectly implementing the solution.** The solution to this problem is fairly straightforward, but there are a few things that you need to be careful of. First, you need to make sure that you're not counting the same key twice. Second, you need to make sure that you're not buying more keys than you need.
* **Incorrectly testing the solution.** Once you've implemented your solution, you need to test it to make sure that it works correctly. The best way to do this is to create a few test cases and run your solution on them. If your solution passes all of the test cases, then you can be confident that it is correct.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly identifying the input format:** A developer might incorrectly identify the input format and think that the first line of the input contains the types of the doors between the rooms, instead of the number of rooms in the house. This would lead to the developer storing the wrong data in the doors array.
* **Incorrectly storing the input data:** A developer might incorrectly store the input data and end up with two arrays that are not the same length. This would lead to the developer having problems iterating through the arrays and finding the minimum number of keys that Vitaly needs to buy.
* **Incorrectly using the input data:** A developer might incorrectly use the input data and end up counting the same key twice. This would lead to the developer buying more keys than they need.
* **Incorrectly implementing the solution:** A developer might incorrectly implement the solution and end up buying more keys than they need. This could happen if the developer doesn't check to make sure that they're not buying the same key twice.
* **Incorrectly testing the solution:** A developer might incorrectly test the solution and think that it is correct, when it is actually not. This could happen if the developer doesn't create enough test cases or if the test cases are not comprehensive.

**1. The input format is not specified.**

The input format is not specified in the problem statement. This could lead to developers misinterpreting the input and making incorrect assumptions. For example, a developer might assume that the input is a list of integers, when it is actually a list of strings. This could lead to errors in the code.

**2. The output format is not specified.**

The output format is also not specified in the problem statement. This could lead to developers misinterpreting the output and making incorrect assumptions. For example, a developer might assume that the output is a single integer, when it is actually a list of integers. This could lead to errors in the code.

**3. The problem is not well-defined.**

The problem is not well-defined in the problem statement. For example, it is not clear what is meant by "the difference between difficulties of the easiest and the hardest of the chosen problems must be at least x". Does this mean that the difference must be exactly x, or does it mean that the difference must be greater than or equal to x? This could lead to developers making incorrect assumptions about the problem and implementing incorrect solutions.

**4. The problem is too difficult.**

The problem is too difficult for most developers to solve. This could lead to developers giving up on the problem, or implementing incorrect solutions.

**5. The problem is not interesting.**

Title:
CODEFORCES 715_D. Create a Maze

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly. For example, if you forget to read the last line of input, you will get an incorrect answer.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also very specific. It is important to make sure that you are printing the output in the correct format. For example, if you forget to print a newline character after the last line of output, you will get an incorrect answer.

**3. Incorrect maze generation**

The most important part of this problem is to generate a maze that has the correct difficulty. There are a few ways to do this, but the most common way is to use a backtracking algorithm. Backtracking algorithms are a type of recursive algorithm that can be used to generate mazes of any size.

**4. Incorrect locked door generation**

The locked doors in the maze must be placed in such a way that there is exactly one way to get from the starting point to the ending point. This can be a bit tricky, but there are a few ways to do it. One way is to use a depth-first search algorithm to find all of the possible paths from the starting point to the ending point. Then, you can remove the locked doors from the paths that you don't want.

**5. Incorrect solution**

Even if you have generated a maze with the correct difficulty and placed the locked doors correctly, you still need to make sure that your solution is correct. The solution should be a list of the locked doors in the maze. The list should be in the same order as the doors were presented in the input.

**6. Runtime errors**

The code for this problem can be quite complex, so it is important to make sure that it is free of runtime errors. Runtime errors are errors that occur while the code is running. These errors can be caused by a variety of problems, such as incorrect logic, incorrect data types, or incorrect memory management.

**7. Memory leaks**

Memory leaks are a type of runtime error that occurs when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. Memory leaks can eventually cause a program to crash. To avoid memory leaks, it is important to make sure that you are freeing all of the memory that you allocate.

**8. Incorrect test cases**

It is important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. You should create a variety of test cases, including cases that test for the different types of errors that can occur. By testing your code thoroughly, you can catch any errors before they cause problems in production.

Title:
CODEFORCES 736_A. Tennis Championship

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the only line of input should contain a single integer n. However, a developer may accidentally read multiple lines of input or read a non-integer value. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of games.** The maximum number of games that the winner of the tournament can take part in is equal to the number of players minus 1. However, a developer may accidentally calculate the number of games incorrectly, resulting in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect logic for determining which players can play against each other.** The organizers of the tournament have specified that two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. A developer may incorrectly implement this logic, resulting in two players who are not allowed to play against each other being matched against each other.
4. **Incorrect output.** The output should be a single integer that represents the maximum number of games that the winner of the tournament can take part in. A developer may accidentally output the wrong value, such as the number of players or the number of games played by the winner.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully read the problem statement and input format, and then carefully implement the solution. They should also test their code thoroughly to ensure that it produces the correct output for all possible inputs.

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be two integers separated by a space, but the developer may accidentally use a different delimiter, such as a comma or a tab. This would cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect assumption about the number of days in a month.** The developer may assume that all months have 30 or 31 days, when in reality February has 28 days (or 29 days in a leap year). This would cause the program to output incorrect results for months with 28 days.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of columns.** The developer may forget to take into account the fact that the first day of the month may not be on a Sunday. This would cause the program to output incorrect results for months that start on a weekday other than Sunday.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The developer may forget to print the number of columns to the console, or they may print it in the wrong format. This would cause the program to fail the test cases.
5. **Other bugs.** The developer may make any number of other mistakes when writing the program, such as using incorrect variable names, forgetting to close brackets, or using incorrect operators. These mistakes could all cause the program to crash or output incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect graph representation**. The problem statement specifies that the graph is connected. Make sure that your code correctly checks for this condition and reports an error if the graph is not connected.
3. **Incorrect traversal order**. The problem statement specifies that each clone must visit at most `6` vertices. Make sure that your code correctly traverses the graph and visits each vertex at most once.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The problem statement specifies that the output should be a list of lists, where each inner list contains the vertices visited by a single clone. Make sure that your code correctly formats the output and that it matches the expected output format.
5. **Memory leaks**. Make sure that your code does not leak memory. This can be a common problem when using dynamic data structures such as linked lists or trees.
6. **Time complexity**. The problem statement specifies that the solution must run in `O(n + m)` time. Make sure that your code meets this time complexity requirement.

CODEFORCES 850_C. Arpa and a game with Mojtaba

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the list of numbers.** The input list of numbers is of type `int`, but the code uses a list of type `str`. This will cause errors when trying to divide the numbers by `p`.
2. **Not checking if the list of numbers is empty.** The code does not check if the list of numbers is empty. If the list is empty, Mojtaba cannot make a valid move and will lose the game.
3. **Not considering all possible values of `p` and `k`.** The code only considers values of `p` and `k` that are prime numbers. However, Arpa can also win the game by choosing values of `p` and `k` that are not prime numbers.
4. **Using an incorrect algorithm to find the prime factors of a number.** The code uses a brute-force algorithm to find the prime factors of a number. This algorithm is inefficient and can take a long time to run for large numbers.
5. **Not handling errors correctly.** The code does not handle errors correctly. If an error occurs, the code will simply terminate without printing a result.

To avoid these problems, the developer should use the following tips:

1. Use the correct data type for the list of numbers. The input list of numbers is of type `int`, so the code should use a list of type `int`.
2. Check if the list of numbers is empty. If the list is empty, Mojtaba cannot make a valid move and will lose the game.
3. Consider all possible values of `p` and `k`. Arpa can win the game by choosing values of `p` and `k` that are not prime numbers.
4. Use an efficient algorithm to find the prime factors of a number. The code should use a fast and efficient algorithm to find the prime factors of a number.
5. Handle errors correctly. The code should handle errors correctly. If an error occurs, the code should print an error message and terminate gracefully.

Title:
CODEFORCES 91_E. Igloo Skyscraper

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is given in the form of a string. We need to convert it to a list of integers. We can do this using the `split()` method. For example, if the input data is `"1 2 3 4"`, we can convert it to a list of integers using the following code:

```
data = input().split()
```

This will create a list of strings, where each string is a number. We can then convert each string to an integer using the `int()` function. For example, the following code will convert the list of strings to a list of integers:

```
data = [int(x) for x in data]
```

**2. Incorrect index**

When we are iterating through a list, we need to make sure that we are using the correct index. For example, if we have a list of integers called `data`, the following code will print the first element of the list:

```
print(data[0])
```

However, the following code will cause an error:

```
print(data[10])
```

This is because the index `10` is out of range of the list. The list only has 9 elements, so the index `10` does not exist.

**3. Off-by-one error**

When we are computing the answer to a problem, we need to make sure that we are not making an off-by-one error. For example, if we are computing the sum of the first 100 integers, we need to make sure that we include the number 100 in the sum. If we forget to include the number 100, we will get an incorrect answer.

**4. Undefined variable**

When we are writing code, we need to make sure that we define all of the variables that we use. For example, if we try to print the value of a variable that we have not defined, we will get an error.

**5. Logical error**

When we are writing code, we need to make sure that our logic is correct. For example, if we are writing a program to find the maximum value in a list, we need to make sure that we are not comparing the values in the wrong order.

**6. Syntax error**

When we are writing code, we need to make sure that our syntax is correct. For example, if we forget to close a bracket, we will get a syntax error.

Title:
CODEFORCES 948_C. Producing Snow

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly initializing the variables.** The developer may forget to initialize the variables, which would result in incorrect results. For example, if the developer initializes the variable `i` to `0` instead of `1`, the loop would iterate over the numbers from `0` to `N-1`, instead of from `1` to `N`.
2. **Using the wrong data type.** The developer may use the wrong data type to store the values, which would result in incorrect results. For example, if the developer uses a `int` to store the value of `N`, the value would be truncated to the nearest integer, which could lead to incorrect results.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem, which would result in incorrect results. For example, the developer may use a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem, which would be very inefficient.
4. **Not handling special cases correctly.** The developer may not handle special cases correctly, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may not handle the case where `N` is equal to `0`, which would cause the program to crash.
5. **Making a mistake in the logic.** The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program, which would result in incorrect results. For example, the developer may forget to check if a pile has melted completely, which could lead to incorrect results.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that they understand the problem. The developer should also carefully write the code and test it thoroughly.
Test inputs:

CODEFORCES 976_C. Nested Segments

Pain points:
 1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a number of segments that is not an integer, or the input may contain a segment with invalid left or right endpoints.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may not contain two integers, or the output may contain two integers that are not distinct, or the output may contain two integers that do not correspond to any segments in the input.
3. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm that the developer uses to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not find any valid pairs of indices, or the algorithm may find a valid pair of indices that does not correspond to any segments in the input.
4. **Runtime error.** The algorithm that the developer uses to solve the problem may run into a runtime error. For example, the algorithm may run out of memory, or the algorithm may take too long to run.
5. **Incorrect data type.** The developer may use an incorrect data type to store the segments in the input. For example, the developer may use a `char` array to store the segments, or the developer may use a `float` variable to store the endpoints of the segments.

HACKEREARTH circles-in-rectangles

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type:** The input data is given in centimeters, but the problem statement asks for the answer in mod 10^9 + 7. This can lead to a bug if the developer does not cast the input data to the correct type.
2. **Using the wrong formula:** The formula for calculating the number of circles that can be cut out from a rectangle is given in the problem statement. However, the developer may make a mistake in implementing this formula, which could lead to an incorrect answer.
3. **Not handling overflow:** The number of circles that can be cut out from a rectangle can be very large, so the developer must be careful to handle overflow. This can be done by using a data type that is large enough to store the answer, or by using a modulo operation to keep the answer within the desired range.
4. **Not using the correct algorithm:** The problem can be solved using a simple algorithm that iterates over the possible positions of the circles and checks if they fit in the rectangle. However, the developer may use a more complex algorithm that is not necessary, or that takes longer to run.
5. **Not testing the code:** It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. This can be done by creating a set of test cases that cover all of the possible scenarios.

By following these tips, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving the circles-in-rectangles problem.

HACKEREARTH end-game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable names.** The variable names `a` and `b` are used for both the pawn and the king's positions, which can lead to confusion. It would be better to use different names for each piece, such as `pawn_a`, `pawn_b`, `king_a`, and `king_b`.
2. **Incorrect indentation.** The code is not properly indented, which makes it difficult to read. It would be better to indent the code according to the Python style guide.
3. **Missing spaces.** There are a number of places where spaces are missing, which can also make the code difficult to read. It would be better to add spaces around operators and between words.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The code does not correctly check whether the game is a draw or a win for white. It should check whether the pawn has reached the top row and whether the king can capture the pawn. If the pawn has reached the top row and the king cannot capture it, then white wins. Otherwise, the game is a draw.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The code does not handle errors correctly. If the input is invalid, the code should raise an exception.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def main():
  # Get the number of test cases.
  t = int(input())

  # Loop over the test cases.
  for _ in range(t):
    # Get the input.
    n, a, b, c, d, move = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

    # Check if the game is a draw.
    if a == n and b == 2 and c == 1 and d == n:
      print("Draw")
      continue

    # Check if the game is a win for white.
    if a < n and b == 2 and c == 1 and d == n - 1:

      continue

    # Check if the input is invalid.
    if move < 0 or move > 1:
      raise ValueError("Invalid move")

    # Check if the king can capture the pawn.

1. **Incorrect implementation of binary search**. The binary search algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that can be used to find the position of an element in a sorted array. However, if the implementation of the binary search algorithm is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Using the wrong data structure**. The data structure used to store the data can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. For example, using a linked list to store the data will be much slower than using a binary search tree.
3. **Not handling edge cases**. Many algorithms have edge cases that must be handled correctly in order for the algorithm to work correctly. For example, the binary search algorithm must handle the case where the target element is not found in the array.
4. **Using incorrect variables**. The variables used in an algorithm must be initialized correctly in order for the algorithm to work correctly. For example, if the variable used to store the number of elements in an array is not initialized to the correct value, the algorithm will not work correctly.
5. **Not using the correct algorithm**. There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve a given problem. The choice of algorithm can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. For example, the bubble sort algorithm is much slower than the quick sort algorithm.
6. **Not using efficient data structures**. The data structures used to store the data can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. For example, using a linked list to store the data will be much slower than using a binary search tree.
7. **Not using efficient algorithms**. The algorithms used to solve a problem can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. For example, the bubble sort algorithm is much slower than the quick sort algorithm.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The variable `n` should be an integer, but it is a string in the following code:

```
n = input()
```

2. **Incorrect indentation**. The code should be indented correctly, like this:

```
n = int(input())
```

3. **Incorrect logic**. The code should check if the input is a number or a string. If it is a number, it should add it to the `free_developers` variable. If it is a string, it should subtract 1 from the `free_developers` variable. The following code does not do this correctly:

```
if n == "New Project":
    free_developers -= 1
else:
    free_developers += n
```

4. **Missing error handling**. The code should handle the case where the input is not a number or a string. The following code does not do this correctly:

```
try:
    n = int(input())
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input")

HACKEREARTH product-divisors-6

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of modulo operator**. The modulo operator (%) should be used only when the dividend is greater than or equal to the divisor. For example, 10 % 2 = 0, but 10 % 1 = 10.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. When computing the number of divisors of a number, it is important to make sure that you include the number itself as a divisor. For example, the number 6 has 4 divisors: 1, 2, 3, and 6.
3. **Incorrect use of factorials**. The factorial of a number n is the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.
4. **Incorrect use of exponentiation**. When raising a number to a power, it is important to make sure that the exponent is positive. For example, 2^3 = 8, but 2^-3 = 1 / 8.
5. **Incorrect use of the Sieve of Eratosthenes**. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple algorithm for finding all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given number. It is important to make sure that the algorithm is implemented correctly, as a mistake can lead to incorrect results.
6. **Incorrect use of the Chinese remainder theorem**. The Chinese remainder theorem is a powerful tool for solving systems of congruences. It is important to make sure that the theorem is implemented correctly, as a mistake can lead to incorrect results.
7. **Incorrect use of the extended Euclidean algorithm**. The extended Euclidean algorithm is a powerful tool for finding the greatest common divisor of two integers. It is important to make sure that the algorithm is implemented correctly, as a mistake can lead to incorrect results.

Title:
HACKEREARTH the-blessing-1

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect variable type:** The problem states that `P` and `M` are integers, but the code below uses them as floats. This will cause incorrect results.

```
def solve(P, M):
    food = P
    population = 1
    while True:
        food += M
        population *= 2
        if food / population >= 1:
            return food // population
```

**2. Off-by-one error:** The code below calculates the number of years it takes for the population to reach 1 billion, but then subtracts 1 from that number. This means that the final answer will be one year too small.

```
def solve(P, M):
    food = P
    population = 1
    years = 0
    while population < 10 ** 9:
        food += M
        population *= 2
        years += 1
    return food // population - 1
```

**3. Infinite loop:** The code below will enter an infinite loop if the input is `P = 0` and `M = 0`. This is because the condition `food / population >= 1` will always be true, so the loop will never terminate.

```
def solve(P, M):
    food = P
    population = 1
    while True:
        food += M
        population *= 2
        if food / population >= 1:
            return food // population
```

**4. Incorrect logic:** The code below incorrectly calculates the number of years it takes for the population to reach 1 billion. It does this by dividing the population by 10 ** 9, which is incorrect because the population is a floating-point number.

```
def solve(P, M):
    food = P
    population = 1
    years = 0
    while population / 10 ** 9 < 1:

ATCODER p02911 AtCoder Beginner Contest 141 - Attack Survival

Pain points:
Yes

 1. **Incorrect variable initialization**. The variable `i` is not initialized in the following code:

```
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    print("Yes" if scores[i] > 0 else "No")
```

This will result in a `ValueError` being thrown.

2. **Incorrect loop condition**. The following code will not iterate through all of the players:

```
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    if scores[i] > 0:
        print("Yes")
```

This is because the loop condition will only be true for the first player.

3. **Incorrect use of the `range()` function**. The following code will not iterate through all of the players:

```
for i in range(N):
    print("Yes" if scores[i] > 0 else "No")
```

This is because the `range()` function only iterates up to the specified number, minus one.

4. **Incorrect indentation**. The following code will not produce the correct output:

```
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    print("Yes" if scores[i] > 0 else "No")

print("No")
```

The code should be indented to match the following:

```
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    print("Yes" if scores[i] > 0 else "No")

print("No")
```

5. **Incorrect use of the `if` statement**. The following code will not produce the correct output:

```
if scores[i] > 0:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")

Title:
ATCODER p03047 diverta 2019 Programming Contest - Consecutive Integers

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong formula**

The formula for the number of ways to choose k consecutive integers from a set of n integers is:

```
(n - k + 1)! / (n - 1)!
```

However, some developers may mistakenly use the formula for the number of ways to choose k distinct integers from a set of n integers, which is:

```
n! / (n - k)!
```

This will result in an incorrect answer.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

Another common mistake is to use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, some developers may try to solve the problem by brute force, which is inefficient for large values of n and k.

A more efficient algorithm is to use the following recurrence relation:

```
f(n, k) = f(n - 1, k - 1) + f(n - 1, k)
```

where f(n, k) is the number of ways to choose k consecutive integers from a set of n integers.

**3. Overflow**

When computing the number of ways to choose k consecutive integers, it is important to be aware of the possibility of overflow. This can occur when the value of n is large or when the value of k is close to n.

To avoid overflow, it is necessary to use a data type that is large enough to represent the values of n and k.

**4. Incorrect input**

Another common mistake is to incorrectly parse the input. This can result in the program crashing or producing an incorrect output.

It is important to make sure that the input is correctly parsed before attempting to solve the problem.

**5. Incorrect output**

Finally, it is important to make sure that the output is correct. This means that the output should be formatted correctly and that it should match the expected output.

It is also important to make sure that the output is consistent with the input. For example, if the input is invalid, the output should be an error message.

Title:
ATCODER p03188 AtCoder Grand Contest 030 - Coloring Torus

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is `K` followed by a newline. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly and will output incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format for this problem is `n` followed by a newline, followed by the grid of colors. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to print the output correctly and the judge will not be able to evaluate your solution.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic for this problem is relatively straightforward. However, it is important to make sure that you are correctly counting the number of adjacent squares in each color and that you are correctly assigning colors to the squares. If your logic is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce a valid coloring of the grid.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. There are a number of places in this problem where it is easy to make off-by-one errors. For example, when you are counting the number of adjacent squares in each color, it is important to make sure that you are not counting the same square twice. Similarly, when you are assigning colors to the squares, it is important to make sure that you are not assigning the same color to two adjacent squares.
5. **Memory errors**. This problem does not require a lot of memory, but it is still important to be aware of the memory usage of your program. If your program uses too much memory, it may crash or run out of time.
6. **Time errors**. This problem does not require a lot of time to solve, but it is still important to be aware of the running time of your program. If your program takes too long to run, it may not be able to finish before the time limit is reached.

Title:
ATCODER p03656 AtCoder Grand Contest 018 - Two Trees

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are following the format correctly, or you will get an incorrect answer.

**2. Incorrect tree traversal**

The problem states that the trees are rooted, which means that there is one vertex that has no parent. When traversing the trees, it is important to make sure that you start at the root vertex and then follow the edges to the other vertices. If you do not do this, you may end up with an incorrect answer.

**3. Incorrect calculation of absolute value**

The problem states that the absolute value of the sum of the values at a vertex and its descendants must be 1. When calculating this value, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct formula.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The problem states that the output should be a sequence of integers, where each integer represents the value at a vertex. It is important to make sure that you are formatting your output correctly, or you will get an incorrect answer.

**5. Other bugs**

There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. Some of the most common include:

* Using incorrect data types
* Making a mistake in the logic of your code
* Not handling edge cases correctly
* Running out of memory
* Getting a timeout

It is important to be aware of these possible bugs and to take steps to avoid them when solving this problem.

Title:
ATCODER p03812 AtCoder Grand Contest 010 - Tree Game

Pain points:

 1 3

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly implementing the tree traversal algorithm.** The tree traversal algorithm is a fundamental part of this problem, and any errors in its implementation will likely lead to incorrect results.
* **Not handling the case where the tree is not connected.** The problem statement specifies that the tree must be connected, but a developer may accidentally implement an algorithm that works only for trees that are already connected.
* **Not handling the case where the game is a draw.** The problem statement does not explicitly state that the game must have a winner, but a developer may accidentally implement an algorithm that always returns a winner, even if the game is a draw.
* **Not handling the case where the game is unwinnable.** The problem statement does not explicitly state that the game must be winnable, but a developer may accidentally implement an algorithm that always returns a winning vertex, even if the game is unwinnable.

By carefully considering these possible problems and bugs, developers can write more robust and correct code for solving this problem.

Title:
ATCODER p03981 Kyoto University Programming Contest 2016 - Exam

Pain points:
**1. Using a naive approach to find all substrings of T**

A naive approach to find all substrings of T would be to iterate over all possible starting and ending indices of the substring, and check if each substring is a valid consecutive subsequence of T. This approach would have a time complexity of O(N^2), where N is the length of T.

**2. Using a suffix array to find all substrings of T**

A more efficient approach to find all substrings of T is to use a suffix array. A suffix array is a data structure that stores all of the suffixes of a string in sorted order. This allows us to quickly find all substrings of T that start with a given prefix. The time complexity of this approach is O(N log N).

**3. Using a trie to find all substrings of T**

Another efficient approach to find all substrings of T is to use a trie. A trie is a data structure that stores all of the substrings of a string in a tree-like structure. This allows us to quickly find all substrings of T that contain a given substring. The time complexity of this approach is O(N).

**4. Using a dynamic programming approach to find the maximum number of elements in S**

Once we have found all of the substrings of T, we can use a dynamic programming approach to find the maximum number of elements in S. The dynamic programming solution works by maintaining a table of the maximum number of elements in S that can be formed by using the first i characters of T. We can then fill in the table by iterating over all possible values of i, and using the following recurrence relation:

```
dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[j] + 1), where j is the largest index such that T[j] < T[i]
```

The time complexity of this approach is O(N^2).

**5. Using a greedy approach to find the maximum number of elements in S**

Finally, we can also use a greedy approach to find the maximum number of elements in S. The greedy approach works by iteratively adding the longest substring of T that is not a subsequence of any previously added substring to S. This approach has a time complexity of O(N).

**6. Using a random approach to find the maximum number of elements in S**

Finally, we can also use a random approach to find the maximum number of elements in S. The random approach works by simply randomly choosing substrings of T and adding them to S until S is full. This approach has a time complexity of O(N).

**Which approach is the best?**

The best approach to use depends on the specific constraints of the problem. If the time limit is very tight, then the random approach may be the best option. If the time limit is not as tight, then the dynamic programming approach or the greedy approach may be better options.

## Possible problems

1. The input data may be invalid. For example, the number of players may be negative or the height or width of the field may be negative.
2. The players may not be able to reach the target position in a finite number of steps. For example, if the ball is initially located at the top left corner of the field and the target position is located at the bottom right corner of the field, the players may not be able to reach the target position in a finite number of steps.
3. The players may not be able to kick the ball in a valid direction. For example, if the ball is located at the edge of the field, the players may not be able to kick the ball in a valid direction.
4. The players may not be able to take the ball from each other. For example, if two players are standing at the same position and one of them has the ball, the other player may not be able to take the ball from him.
5. The players may not be able to place the ball where they want. For example, if the ball is located at the edge of the field, the players may not be able to place the ball at a valid position.

## Possible bugs

1. The developer may not correctly check the validity of the input data. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
2. The developer may not correctly implement the algorithm for clearing the ball. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
3. The developer may not correctly handle the edge cases. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

## How to avoid these problems

1. The developer should carefully check the validity of the input data before processing it. This can be done by using a function to validate the input data.
2. The developer should carefully implement the algorithm for clearing the ball. This can be done by using a step-by-step approach and by carefully testing the algorithm.
3. The developer should carefully handle the edge cases. This can be done by testing the algorithm with different input data and by considering all possible scenarios.

Title:
AIZU p00855 Prime Gap

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.** This is the most common mistake that programmers make when solving this problem. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple but efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given integer. It works by iteratively marking all multiples of each prime number as composite, starting with 2. However, if the implementation is not correct, it is possible to miss some prime numbers or mark some composite numbers as prime. This can lead to incorrect results when computing the length of prime gaps.
2. **Incorrect handling of input data.** The input data for this problem is a sequence of positive integers. It is important to make sure that the input data is valid and that all of the integers are positive. If the input data is not valid, it can lead to incorrect results or errors.
3. **Incorrect output format.** The output for this problem is a sequence of non-negative integers. It is important to make sure that the output is formatted correctly and that all of the integers are separated by a single space. If the output format is not correct, it can lead to errors or confusion.
4. **Incorrect calculation of prime gaps.** The length of a prime gap is the number of composite numbers between two successive prime numbers. It is important to make sure that the prime gaps are calculated correctly. If the prime gaps are not calculated correctly, it can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that programmers can encounter when solving this problem. Some common examples include:
    * Using an incorrect data type for the input or output data.
    * Using an incorrect algorithm for finding prime numbers.
    * Making a mistake in the calculation of prime gaps.
    * Not handling all of the possible cases correctly.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
AIZU p00986 Parentheses Editor

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of parentheses**

The problem statement mentions that the input consists of a single test case given in a line containing a number of characters, each of which is a command key to the editor, that is, either ‘(’, ‘)’, or ‘-’. The number of characters does not exceed 200 000. They represent a key input sequence to the editor. It is guaranteed that no ‘-’ command comes when the text is empty.

However, a developer may accidentally use the wrong type of parentheses, such as using curly braces instead of parentheses. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect handling of empty strings**

The problem statement also mentions that initially, the editor keeps an empty text. A developer may accidentally assume that the text is not empty, and this could lead to incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect handling of unbalanced parentheses**

The problem statement states that a balanced string is one of the following:

* “()”
* “($X$)” where $X$ is a balanced string
* “$XY$” where both $X$ and $Y$ are balanced strings

However, a developer may accidentally create an unbalanced string, such as “(()”. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect use of recursion**

The problem can be solved using recursion. However, a developer may make a mistake in the recursive function, such as using the wrong base case or not handling the recursive calls correctly. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect use of data structures**

The problem can be solved using a variety of data structures, such as stacks, queues, or linked lists. However, a developer may make a mistake in the way they use these data structures. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

3. **Incorrect handling of errors.** The code below does not handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input is invalid, the code will crash.
4. **Inconsistent coding style.** The code below uses inconsistent coding style. For example, some variables are capitalized while others are not. This can make the code difficult to read and understand.
5. **Missing comments.** The code below does not contain any comments. This makes it difficult for other developers to understand what the code is doing.

Title:
AIZU p01733 Fox Observation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correct. For example, the input may not have the correct number of elements, or the elements may not be in the correct format.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correct. For example, the output may not have the correct number of elements, or the elements may not be in the correct format.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not find the correct answer, or it may take too long to run.
4. **Incorrect data**. The data used to test the solution may be incorrect. For example, the data may contain invalid values, or it may not be representative of the real world.
5. **Incorrect implementation**. The implementation of the solution may be incorrect. For example, the code may contain bugs, or it may not be efficient.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the solution thoroughly with a variety of different data sets.

Title:
AIZU p02009 Nim without Zero

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the number of heaps $N$ is not an integer, or there is a heap with a negative number of stones.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be either "Alice" or "Bob".
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to determine the winner is incorrect. For example, it does not consider all possible moves, or it does not take into account the fact that the XOR sum of the remaining stones can become 0.
4. **Memory leak**. The program does not free up memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to a system crash or a decrease in performance.
5. **Race condition**. The program does not properly synchronize access to shared resources. This can lead to incorrect results or a system crash.
6. **Security vulnerability**. The program does not properly check the input for malicious content. This can allow an attacker to gain access to the system or to execute arbitrary code.

Title:
AIZU p02152 Tunnel

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** This is the most common bug that developers encounter when solving problems. It is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. The algorithm should be implemented correctly, and all edge cases should be handled.
2. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The choice of data structure can have a significant impact on the performance of an algorithm. It is important to choose a data structure that is well-suited for the problem being solved. For example, a linked list would not be a good choice for storing a large number of integers, as it would be inefficient for random access.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a developer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to incorrect results, or even a program crash.
4. **Incorrect typecasting.** Typecasting is the process of converting a value from one data type to another. If the typecasting is not done correctly, it can lead to incorrect results or a program crash.
5. **Memory leaks.** Memory leaks occur when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to a program crash.

To avoid these bugs, it is important to carefully read the problem statement, implement the algorithm correctly, and use the correct data structures. It is also important to test the program thoroughly to catch any bugs that may have been missed.

Title:
AIZU p02293 Parallel/Orthogonal

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect calculation of slopes.** The slopes of the two lines are calculated using the following formula:

```
m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
```

However, if the two lines are parallel, the slopes will be equal. This can lead to the incorrect conclusion that the lines are orthogonal.

2. **Incorrect calculation of the intersection point.** The intersection point of the two lines is calculated using the following formula:

```
(x, y) = ((x1y2 - x2y1) / (y2 - y1), (x2y1 - x1y2) / (y2 - y1))
```

However, if the two lines are parallel, the intersection point will be undefined. This can lead to the incorrect conclusion that the lines are orthogonal.

3. **Incorrect handling of degenerate cases.** The degenerate case occurs when the two lines are identical. In this case, the slopes of the two lines will be equal and the intersection point will be undefined. This can lead to the incorrect conclusion that the lines are parallel or orthogonal.

4. **Incorrect handling of floating-point errors.** The calculations involved in determining whether two lines are parallel or orthogonal are subject to floating-point errors. This can lead to the incorrect conclusion that the lines are parallel or orthogonal when they are not.

5. **Incorrect handling of input errors.** The input data may contain errors, such as invalid values or missing values. This can lead to the incorrect conclusion that the lines are parallel or orthogonal when they are not.

Title:
AIZU p02440 Min-Max Element

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the number of elements in $A$ is not given in the first line.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed. For example, the minimum element or the maximum element is not printed in a line.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The minimum element or the maximum element is not calculated correctly. For example, the minimum element in a range is not the smallest element in the range.
4. **Memory leak**. The program does not release the memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to a program crash or a performance issue.
5. **Race condition**. The program does not protect shared data from being accessed by multiple threads at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or a program crash.
6. **Deadlock**. The program enters a state where no thread can make progress. This can lead to a program hang or a program crash.
7. **Security vulnerability**. The program allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system. This can lead to data theft, system compromise, or other security breaches.
