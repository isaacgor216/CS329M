CODECHEF amsgame1

Pain points:
**Possible Problems and Bugs:**

* **Incorrect implementation of the game rules.** The game rules are not clearly defined, so it is possible to implement them incorrectly. For example, it is not clear whether the two numbers that are subtracted from each other must be distinct. If they are not, then the game could terminate in a state where all the numbers are equal, but not to 1.
* **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The input could contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers that are too large. The program must be able to handle these edge cases gracefully.
* **Incorrect use of data structures.** The program must use data structures that are appropriate for the problem. For example, if the input contains a large number of numbers, then it would be inefficient to use a list to store them.
* **Incorrect algorithm.** The program must use an algorithm that is efficient and correct. For example, a brute-force algorithm that tries all possible combinations of numbers would be very inefficient.
* **Incorrect error handling.** The program must handle errors gracefully. For example, if the program encounters an unexpected error, it should print an error message and exit.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the game rules. It is also important to test the program thoroughly with a variety of input data.

Title:
CODECHEF chn15a

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of integers. If the developer does not convert the input data to the correct data type, the program will not work correctly. For example, if the input data is a list of strings, the program will try to convert the strings to integers, which will result in an error.

**2. Incorrect logic**

The logic of the program must be correct in order for the program to work correctly. For example, if the program is supposed to find the number of Wolverine-like minions, the logic must correctly count the number of minions whose characteristic values are divisible by 7.

**3. Off-by-one error**

An off-by-one error occurs when the developer accidentally counts one more or one less than the correct number of items. For example, if the program is supposed to find the number of Wolverine-like minions, the developer might accidentally count the number of minions whose characteristic values are greater than or equal to 7, which would result in an incorrect answer.

**4. Undefined variable**

A variable that is not defined will cause the program to crash. For example, if the developer tries to use a variable that has not been declared, the program will crash.

**5. Uninitialized variable**

A variable that is not initialized will have an unpredictable value. For example, if the developer tries to use a variable that has not been assigned a value, the program will use the unpredictable value of the variable, which could result in an incorrect answer.

**6. Memory leak**

A memory leak occurs when a program does not free up memory that it is no longer using. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash. For example, if the developer creates a new object but does not delete it when it is no longer needed, the program will continue to use the memory for the object, even though the object is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to a memory leak.

**7. Race condition**

A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. For example, if two threads are trying to update the same variable at the same time, the program could crash or the variable could be updated with incorrect data.

**8. Deadlock**

A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can cause the program to stop running and the threads to be stuck in an infinite loop. For example, if two threads are both trying to lock the same resource, the threads will wait for each other to release the resource, but neither thread will release the resource, so the threads will be stuck in an infinite loop.

Title:
CODECHEF kjcc02

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The variable `sum` should be of type `int`, not `str`.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator.** The operator `>=` should be used instead of `>`.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The maximum value should be found by iterating over the list of numbers, not by comparing the first two numbers.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single color, not a list of colors.
5. **Missing error handling.** The code should handle the case where the input list is empty.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def get_color(sum):
  """Gets the color corresponding to the given sum."""

  colors = ["red", "blue", "pink", "white", "black", "violet", "cyan", "yellow", "green", "brown"]
  return colors[sum]


def main():
  """The main function."""

  # Get the number of test cases.

  t = int(input())

  # Iterate over the test cases.

  for _ in range(t):
    # Get the number of numbers in the list.

    n = int(input())

    # Get the list of numbers.

    numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Find the maximum sum of digits.

    max_sum = max([sum(map(int, str(n))) for n in numbers])

    # Get the corresponding color.

    color = get_color(max_sum)

    # Print the color.

    print(color)

Title:
CODECHEF orders

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format must be exactly as specified in the problem statement. For example, if the output contains a space between two numbers, the program may be incorrect.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating through an array, it is important to make sure that the index is incremented correctly. Otherwise, the program may skip over or repeat elements of the array.
4. **Incorrect variable initialization**. When initializing variables, it is important to make sure that they are assigned the correct values. Otherwise, the program may not work correctly.
5. **Logic errors**. The logic of the program must be correct in order for it to work correctly. For example, if the program does not account for all possible cases, it may not work correctly.
6. **Memory leaks**. When a program allocates memory, it is important to free that memory when it is no longer needed. Otherwise, the program may eventually run out of memory and crash.
7. **Race conditions**. When multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is important to make sure that the data is accessed in a consistent manner. Otherwise, the program may produce incorrect results.
8. **Deadlocks**. When multiple threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, it is possible for the threads to deadlock. This means that the threads will be stuck waiting for each other forever, and the program will not be able to continue.
9. **Security vulnerabilities**. It is important to make sure that the program is secure. For example, the program should not allow users to input arbitrary code. Otherwise, the program could be exploited by attackers.
10. **Performance issues**. The program should be efficient and should not take too long to run. For example, the program should not use unnecessary loops or recursion.

CODEFORCES 102_A. Clothes

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash or output incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values may not be correctly specified, which may cause the program to crash or output incorrect results. For example, if the input values are specified as strings, the program may crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, which may cause the program to output incorrect results. For example, if the program does not consider all possible cases, it may output incorrect results.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the program misses or adds one element when iterating over a list or array. This can cause the program to output incorrect results.
5. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when the program does not properly free up memory that it has allocated. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
6. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to output incorrect results or crash.
7. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, which prevents any of the threads from continuing. This can cause the program to run indefinitely or crash.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can occur when the program does not properly protect sensitive data, such as passwords or credit card numbers. This can allow attackers to access this data and use it for malicious purposes.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1051_A. Vasya And Password

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correctly parsed by the program. This can lead to errors such as accessing an element of an array that does not exist, or dividing by zero.

To avoid this problem, make sure that the input format is correct. You can do this by using a regular expression to validate the input, or by manually checking the input for errors.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also important to get correct. If the output format is incorrect, the program may not be able to produce the correct output, or it may produce an incorrect output that is difficult to understand.

To avoid this problem, make sure that the output format is correct. You can do this by using a regular expression to validate the output, or by manually checking the output for errors.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic of the program is also important to get correct. If the logic is incorrect, the program may not be able to solve the problem, or it may produce an incorrect solution.

To avoid this problem, carefully check the logic of your program. Make sure that you understand each step of the logic, and that the logic is correct.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that can occur when programming. This type of error occurs when a programmer accidentally counts one more or one less than they intended.

To avoid this problem, carefully check your code for off-by-one errors. Make sure that you are counting correctly, and that you are not accidentally skipping or repeating any steps.

**5. Using the wrong data type**

Using the wrong data type can also lead to errors. For example, if you try to store a number in a variable that is not big enough, the program may overflow and produce an incorrect result.

To avoid this problem, make sure that you are using the correct data type for each variable. You can do this by checking the data type requirements for each function or operation that you are using.

**6. Using global variables**

Using global variables can also lead to errors. This is because global variables can be accessed from anywhere in the program, which can make it difficult to track down errors.

To avoid this problem, avoid using global variables unless you absolutely need to. If you do need to use a global variable, make sure that you use it carefully and that you document its purpose.

**7. Not using error handling**

Not using error handling can also lead to errors. This is because errors can occur at any time during the execution of a program, and if they are not handled properly, the program may crash or produce an incorrect result.

To avoid this problem, make sure that you use error handling in your programs. This means that you should check for errors and handle them appropriately. You can do this by using the `try...catch` statement in Java, or the `try...except` statement in Python.

**8. Not testing your code**

Not testing your code is the most common cause of errors. This is because it is impossible to know if your code is correct unless you test it.

To avoid this problem, make sure that you test your code thoroughly. This means that you should test your code with different inputs, and that you should check for both expected and unexpected errors.

**9. Using outdated libraries**

Using outdated libraries can also lead to errors. This is because outdated libraries may contain bugs or security vulnerabilities.

To avoid this problem, make sure that you are using the latest versions of your libraries. You can do this by checking the documentation for each library, or by using a package manager to keep your libraries up to date.

CODEFORCES 1073_B. Vasya and Books

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very strict. It allows for a variety of different ways to enter the data. However, if the input format is not followed correctly, the program will not be able to correctly parse the data and will produce an incorrect output.

For example, if the input is entered as a single line of text, the program will not be able to correctly identify the individual values and will produce an incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also not very strict. It allows for a variety of different ways to output the results. However, if the output format is not followed correctly, the program will not be able to correctly display the results and will produce an incorrect output.

For example, if the output is not separated by newlines, the program will not be able to correctly format the output and will produce an incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect data**

The data for this problem is not always correct. It is possible that the data may contain errors, such as duplicate values or values that are out of range. If the data is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly process the data and will produce an incorrect output.

For example, if the data contains a duplicate value, the program will not be able to correctly identify the unique values and will produce an incorrect output.

**4. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve this problem is not always correct. It is possible that the algorithm may contain errors, such as incorrect logic or incorrect assumptions. If the algorithm is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem and will produce an incorrect output.

For example, if the algorithm assumes that the data is always correct, the program will not be able to correctly handle incorrect data and will produce an incorrect output.

**5. Incorrect implementation**

The implementation of the algorithm is not always correct. It is possible that the implementation may contain errors, such as incorrect variable names or incorrect code logic. If the implementation is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly execute the algorithm and will produce an incorrect output.

For example, if the implementation uses incorrect variable names, the program will not be able to correctly track the state of the algorithm and will produce an incorrect output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1095_B. Array Stabilization

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly computing the instability of the array.** The instability of an array is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. To compute this, you need to find the maximum and minimum elements in the array, and then subtract the minimum from the maximum.
2. **Removing the wrong element from the array.** To minimize the instability of the array, you need to remove the element that is closest to the mean of the array. The mean of the array is the sum of all the elements in the array divided by the number of elements in the array.
3. **Not handling edge cases correctly.** There are a few edge cases that you need to be aware of when solving this problem. For example, what if the array is empty? What if the array has only one element?
4. **Using inefficient algorithms.** There are more efficient ways to solve this problem than simply iterating through the array and computing the instability of each possible subset of the array.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly computing the instability of the array.** A developer might incorrectly compute the instability of the array by subtracting the maximum element from the minimum element instead of the other way around. This would result in an incorrect answer.
* **Removing the wrong element from the array.** A developer might remove the wrong element from the array by removing the element that is furthest from the mean of the array instead of the element that is closest to the mean. This would also result in an incorrect answer.
* **Not handling edge cases correctly.** A developer might not handle edge cases correctly, such as the case where the array is empty or the case where the array has only one element. This could result in a runtime error or an incorrect answer.
* **Using inefficient algorithms.** A developer might use an inefficient algorithm to solve this problem, such as iterating through the array and computing the instability of each possible subset of the array. This could result in a slow runtime.
Test inputs:
```
# 1. Incorrectly computing the instability of the array

n = 4
a = [1, 3, 3, 7]

# The instability of the array is 7 - 1 = 6.
# However, the following code incorrectly computes the instability as 3 - 1 = 2.

instability = max(a) - min(a)
print(instability)

# 2. Removing the wrong element from the array

n = 4
a = [1, 3, 3, 7]

# The correct answer is 2.
# However, the following code removes the element 7, which is not the closest element to the mean.

mean = sum(a) / n
index = a.index(min(a, key=lambda x: abs(x - mean)))
a.pop(index)
instability = max(a) - min(a)
print(instability)

# 3. Not handling edge cases correctly

n = 0
a = []

# The following code will throw a runtime error.

instability = max(a) - min(a)

CODEFORCES 1114_C. Trailing Loves (or L'oeufs?)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be two integers n and b, separated by a space. If the input format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The input integers n and b should be of type `int`. If the input integers are of other types, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Arithmetic overflow.** The factorial of a large number can be very large. If the factorial of n is too large to be represented by an `int` variable, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
4. **Off-by-one error.** The number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary representation of n! is not always equal to the number of factors of b in n!. For example, the number of factors of 2 in 10! is 5, but the number of trailing zero digits in the binary representation of 10! is 6. To avoid this error, it is important to carefully count the number of factors of b in n!.
5. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm used to count the number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary representation of n! may be incorrect. For example, the following algorithm is incorrect:

```
def trailing_zeros(n, b):
  """Counts the number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary representation of n."""
  count = 0
  while n % b == 0:
    count += 1
    n //= b
  return count
```

This algorithm is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the number of factors of b in n! can be greater than the number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary representation of n!.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format, data types, and algorithm used to count the number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary representation of n!.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1142_D. Foreigner

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect logic**. One common mistake is to incorrectly implement the logic for determining whether a number is inadequate. For example, the following code would incorrectly count the number of inadequate numbers in the string "123456":

```
def is_inadequate(n):
  if n < 10:
    return True
  else:
    return n % 11 == n // 10 % 11

def count_inadequate(s):
  count = 0
  for i in range(len(s) - 1):
    if is_inadequate(int(s[i:i + 2])):
      count += 1
  return count

print(count_inadequate("123456"))
```

The correct logic is to check whether the last digit of the number is strictly less than the remainder of dividing the number by 11. For example, the following code would correctly count the number of inadequate numbers in the string "123456":

```
def is_inadequate(n):
  if n < 10:
    return True
  else:
    return n % 11 < n // 10 % 11

def count_inadequate(s):
  count = 0
  for i in range(len(s) - 1):
    if is_inadequate(int(s[i:i + 2])):
      count += 1
  return count

print(count_inadequate("123456"))
```

2. **Incorrect data type**. Another common mistake is to use the wrong data type to store the numbers in the string. For example, the following code would incorrectly count the number of inadequate numbers in the string "123456":

```
def count_inadequate(s):
  count = 0
  for i in range(len(s)):
    if int(s[i]) < 10:
      count += 1
  return count

print(count_inadequate("123456"))
```

The correct data type to use is `int`. For example, the following code would correctly count the number of inadequate numbers in the string "123456":

```
def count_inadequate(s):
  count = 0
  for i in range(len(s)):
    if int(s[i]) < 10:
      count += 1
  return count

print(count_inadequate("123456"))
```

3. **Off-by-one error**. Another common mistake is to make an off-by-one error when counting the number of inadequate numbers. For example, the following code would incorrectly count the number of inadequate numbers in the string "123456":

```
def count_inadequate(s):
  count = 0
  for i in range(len(s) - 1):
    if int(s[i:i + 2]) < 10:
      count += 1
  return count

print(count_inadequate("123456"))
```

The correct code should count the number of inadequate numbers in the string, not the number of digits in the string. For example, the following code would correctly count the number of inadequate numbers in the string "123456":

```
def count_inadequate(s):
  count = 0
  for i in range(len(s) - 1):
    if int(s[i:i + 2]) < 10:
      count += 1

Title:
CODEFORCES 1162_F. Palindrome XOR

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the palindrome checking function**

The palindrome checking function should check if the string is a palindrome by iterating over the string from both ends and comparing the characters. However, if the function does not iterate over the string from both ends, it may incorrectly identify a string as a palindrome. For example, the string "abba" is a palindrome, but the function may incorrectly identify it as not a palindrome if it only iterates over the string from the left.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the XOR operation**

The XOR operation is a binary operation that returns a 1 if and only if exactly one of the two operands is a 1. However, if the XOR operation is not implemented correctly, it may return an incorrect value. For example, the XOR operation of the two numbers 0 and 1 should be 1, but if the operation is not implemented correctly, it may return 0.

**3. Incorrect implementation of the modulo operation**

The modulo operation returns the remainder of a division operation. However, if the modulo operation is not implemented correctly, it may return an incorrect value. For example, the modulo operation of the numbers 10 and 3 should be 1, but if the operation is not implemented correctly, it may return 2.

**4. Incorrect use of the bitwise operators**

The bitwise operators are used to perform operations on bits. However, if the bitwise operators are not used correctly, they may produce incorrect results. For example, the bitwise AND operator returns a 1 if and only if both operands are 1. However, if the bitwise AND operator is used incorrectly, it may return a 1 even if one of the operands is 0.

**5. Incorrect use of the modulo operator**

The modulo operator returns the remainder of a division operation. However, if the modulo operator is not used correctly, it may produce incorrect results. For example, the modulo operator of the numbers 10 and 3 should be 1, but if the operator is not used correctly, it may return 2.

CODEFORCES 1200_F. Graph Traveler

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make mistakes when reading the input. For example, if the input contains a number that is too large, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect edge traversal**. The edges of the graph are traversed in a specific order, and it is easy to make mistakes when implementing this logic. For example, if the edges are not traversed in the correct order, the program may not find all of the vertices that are visited infinitely many times.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of visited vertices**. The number of visited vertices is calculated by keeping track of the vertices that have been visited already. It is easy to make mistakes when implementing this logic, such as forgetting to add a vertex to the list of visited vertices.
4. **Incorrect output**. The output of the program should be a list of the numbers of visited vertices for each query. It is easy to make mistakes when printing the output, such as printing the wrong numbers or printing the numbers in the wrong order.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the program thoroughly with a variety of input data.

CODEFORCES 1327_D. Infinite Path

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

When working with large data, it is important to use the correct data types. For example, if you are working with integers that are larger than 2^31-1, you should use the `long` data type instead of the `int` data type.

**2. Using incorrect algorithms**

There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve a given problem. It is important to choose the correct algorithm for the problem you are trying to solve. For example, if you are trying to find the longest common substring in two strings, you should use the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm instead of the brute-force algorithm.

**3. Making incorrect assumptions**

When solving a problem, it is important to make sure that you are not making any incorrect assumptions. For example, if you are trying to find the shortest path in a graph, you should not assume that the graph is connected.

**4. Not handling errors correctly**

It is important to handle errors correctly when writing code. For example, if you are trying to read data from a file, you should check for errors and handle them appropriately.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before deploying it to production. This will help you to catch bugs and errors before they cause problems for your users.

**6. Not using version control**

CODEFORCES 1368_D. AND, OR and square sum

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a collection of non-negative integers. So we should use an integer data type to store the numbers. If we use a floating-point data type, such as float or double, the precision may not be enough to represent the numbers. This may lead to incorrect results.

**2. Not handling the edge cases correctly**

The input data may contain some edge cases, such as n = 0 or n = 1. We need to handle these cases correctly.

**3. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The basic idea is to repeatedly find two numbers that have the largest product and perform the AND operation on them. However, there are some optimizations that can be made to improve the performance of the algorithm.

**4. Making a mistake in the implementation**

The implementation of the algorithm should be correct. Otherwise, the wrong results will be produced.

**5. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. This can be done by generating random test cases and checking the output of the code.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1389_F. Bicolored Segments

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the segment intersection algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The segment intersection algorithm should check for both endpoints of each segment, and not just the start and end points.
2. **Incorrect handling of overlapping segments.** Two segments are considered overlapping if they share at least one point. When two segments overlap, they should be treated as a single segment for the purposes of the problem.
3. **Incorrect handling of adjacent segments.** Two segments are considered adjacent if they share a common endpoint. When two segments are adjacent, they should be treated as a single segment for the purposes of the problem.
4. **Incorrect handling of degenerate segments.** A degenerate segment is a segment with zero length. Degenerate segments should be ignored when computing the maximum number of non-overlapping segments.
5. **Incorrect handling of the input data.** The input data may contain invalid values, such as negative lengths or segments that overlap or intersect. The program should be able to handle these invalid values gracefully.

**Additional tips:**

* To avoid incorrect implementation of the segment intersection algorithm, use a library that implements the algorithm correctly.
* To avoid incorrect handling of overlapping and adjacent segments, use a data structure that allows you to efficiently find all overlapping and adjacent segments.
* To avoid incorrect handling of degenerate segments, check for degenerate segments before computing the maximum number of non-overlapping segments.
* To avoid incorrect handling of the input data, validate the input data before processing it.

CODEFORCES 140_C. New Year Snowmen

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when reading the input data. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is represented as a string, so it is important to convert it to the correct data type before using it in the program. For example, if the input contains a string "123", the program will try to convert it to an integer, which will result in an error.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program should be correct in order to solve the problem. For example, if the program tries to make a snowman from three identical snowballs, it will fail.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are common when programming, and they can be difficult to find. For example, if the program tries to find the maximum number of snowmen that can be made from n snowballs, it might accidentally count one snowman too many or too few.
5. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks can occur when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions**. Race conditions can occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results or crashing.
7. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can prevent the program from making any progress and eventually crashing.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1430_G. Yet Another DAG Problem

Pain points:
**1. Incorrectly defining the data structure to store the graph.**

The input graph is represented as a list of edges, where each edge is a tuple of the form (u, v, w), where u and v are the vertices that the edge connects, and w is the weight of the edge. This data structure is not ideal for solving this problem, because it does not allow us to easily find all of the edges that are incident on a given vertex.

A better data structure would be a [adjacency list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list), which stores a list of all of the edges that are incident on each vertex. This data structure would allow us to quickly find all of the edges that are incident on a given vertex, which is necessary for the algorithm that we will use to solve this problem.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem.**

The problem can be solved using a [topological sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting) algorithm. A topological sorting algorithm orders the vertices of a directed acyclic graph such that if there is an edge from vertex u to vertex v, then u appears before v in the sorted order.

Once we have a topological sorting of the vertices, we can solve the problem by iteratively assigning values to the vertices in the sorted order. When we assign a value to a vertex v, we add the weights of all of the edges that are incident on v to a running total. We then subtract this running total from the value of each of the vertices that v is adjacent to.

This algorithm will always find a solution to the problem, and it will find the optimal solution if the graph is acyclic. However, if the graph contains cycles, the algorithm may not find the optimal solution.

**3. Not handling the edge weights correctly.**

The edge weights in the input graph are non-negative. This means that we can always assign a value to a vertex v such that all of the b_i values are positive. However, we need to be careful not to assign a value to v that is too large, because this could cause the running total to overflow.

To avoid this problem, we can use the following algorithm to assign values to the vertices:

1. Initialize the running total to 0.
2. For each vertex v in the topological sorting of the vertices, do the following:
    * Add the weights of all of the edges that are incident on v to the running total.
    * Subtract this running total from the value of each of the vertices that v is adjacent to.
3. The final values of the vertices will be the optimal solution to the problem.

**4. Not handling the special case of a graph with no edges.**

The input graph may contain no edges. In this case, the solution to the problem is trivial: we can assign any value to each of the vertices.

**5. Not handling the special case of a graph with a single vertex.**

The input graph may contain a single vertex. In this case, the solution to the problem is also trivial: we can assign any value to the vertex.

**1. Using the wrong data type for N and M.** The input specifies that N and M are integers, but a developer might accidentally use a floating-point type, such as float or double. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
2. **Using the wrong comparison operator.** The problem specifies that the output should be "YES" if N is divisible by M, and "NO" otherwise. A developer might accidentally use the equality operator (==) instead of the modulo operator (%). This would cause the program to output "YES" even if N is not divisible by M.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** The problem states that N must be divisible by M, but it does not specify whether N must be equal to M. A developer might accidentally check for equality instead of divisibility, which would cause the program to output "NO" even if N is divisible by M.
4. **Incorrect indentation.** The problem statement is not very clear about the expected indentation of the code. A developer might accidentally indent the code incorrectly, which would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
5. **Using the wrong algorithm.** The problem can be solved using a simple algorithm that checks if N is divisible by M. A developer might accidentally use a more complex algorithm, which would be unnecessary and could slow down the program.
6. **Using global variables.** The problem does not specify whether global variables can be used. A developer might accidentally use a global variable, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.
7. **Not handling errors correctly.** The problem does not specify how to handle errors. A developer might accidentally ignore errors, which could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
8. **Not testing the program thoroughly.** The problem does not specify how to test the program. A developer might not test the program thoroughly, which could lead to bugs being missed.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific. Make sure that you are reading the input correctly and that you are not missing any of the required fields.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output for this problem should be either "tolik" or "bolik". Make sure that you are not accidentally printing any other characters or words.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the winning player.** The winning player is the one who can remove the last stone from a dumper. Make sure that you are correctly calculating the number of stones in each dumper and that you are choosing the correct player to win.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The logic for this problem is relatively simple, but it is important to make sure that you are correctly implementing it. Make sure that you are understanding the problem statement and that you are able to correctly apply the logic to the input data.
5. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that can occur when you are working with indexes or array sizes. Make sure that you are carefully checking your code for off-by-one errors.
6. **Memory leaks.** Memory leaks can occur when you allocate memory but do not free it when you are finished with it. This can cause your program to run out of memory and crash. Make sure that you are freeing any memory that you allocate in your program.
7. **Race conditions.** Race conditions can occur when multiple threads or processes are trying to access the same data at the same time. This can cause your program to produce incorrect results or to crash. Make sure that you are using appropriate synchronization mechanisms to avoid race conditions.
8. **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads or processes are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can cause your program to hang indefinitely. Make sure that you are using appropriate synchronization mechanisms to avoid deadlocks.
9. **Buffer overflows.** Buffer overflows can occur when you write data to a buffer that is not large enough to hold it. This can cause your program to crash or to execute arbitrary code. Make sure that you are using the correct size buffers for your data.
10. **Format string vulnerabilities.** Format string vulnerabilities can occur when you use the printf() or scanf() functions incorrectly. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on your system. Make sure that you are using these functions correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 178_F3. Representative Sampling

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type**

When dealing with strings, it is important to use the correct data type. In Python, strings are represented by the `str` type. If you try to use an incorrect data type, such as an integer, you will get an error.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. The most efficient algorithm is the dynamic programming algorithm. This algorithm works by building up a table of the longest common prefixes of all possible subsequences of the proteins. Once the table is built, it is easy to find the subsequence with the largest representativity.

**3. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

When solving a problem, it is important to make sure that you handle all of the boundary conditions correctly. For example, in this problem, you need to make sure that you handle the case where `k` is greater than the number of proteins.

**4. Not using enough test cases**

When debugging a program, it is important to use a variety of test cases. This will help you to identify any bugs that you may have missed.

**5. Not using a debugger**

A debugger can be a very helpful tool when debugging a program. It allows you to step through the code line by line and see what is happening. This can help you to identify bugs that you may not have been able to find otherwise.

**6. Giving up too easily**

Solving difficult problems can be challenging. It is important to not give up too easily. If you are stuck, try taking a break and coming back to the problem later. You may also find it helpful to ask for help from someone else.

CODEFORCES 202_A. LLPS

Pain points:
**1. The input string may not be a palindrome.**

For example, the input string "codeforces" is not a palindrome. In this case, the output should be the lexicographically largest substring of the input string that is a palindrome. In this case, the output should be "s".

**2. The input string may contain duplicate characters.**

For example, the input string "mississipp" contains two instances of the letter "s". In this case, the output should be the lexicographically largest substring of the input string that is a palindrome and that does not contain any duplicate characters. In this case, the output should be "ssss".

**3. The input string may be very long.**

For example, the input string "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" is 100 characters long. In this case, it is important to use an efficient algorithm to find the lexicographically largest palindromic substring of the input string.

**4. The input string may contain non-alphabetic characters.**

For example, the input string "1234567890" does not contain any alphabetic characters. In this case, the output should be an empty string.

**5. The input string may be invalid.**

For example, the input string "```" is not a valid string. In this case, the output should be an empty string.

### Possible Problems

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correct. For example, the number of nodes `n` is not a positive integer.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correct. For example, the output is not a list of integers.
3. **Memory limit exceeded**. The program uses too much memory. For example, the program creates a very large array.
4. **Time limit exceeded**. The program runs too long. For example, the program uses a recursive algorithm to solve a problem that can be solved in a more efficient way.
5. **Incorrect solution**. The program does not solve the problem correctly. For example, the program returns the wrong answer.

### Possible Bugs

1. **Off-by-one error**. The program is incorrect because it misses one or more cases. For example, the program does not consider the case where the first node in the list is the only node that is attacked.
2. **Index out of bounds error**. The program is incorrect because it accesses an element of an array or a list that does not exist. For example, the program tries to access the element at index `n` in an array of size `n - 1`.
3. **Arithmetic overflow error**. The program is incorrect because it performs an arithmetic operation that results in an overflow. For example, the program tries to divide a number by zero.
4. **Null pointer dereference error**. The program is incorrect because it tries to dereference a null pointer. For example, the program tries to access the value of a variable that has not been initialized.
5. **Race condition**. The program is incorrect because it accesses shared data in a way that can lead to inconsistent results. For example, the program reads the value of a variable from one thread and then writes the value of the variable to another thread without synchronizing the access.

Title:
CODEFORCES 299_A. Ksusha and Array

Pain points:
1. **Using incorrect data type.** The input contains integers, so the developer should use an integer data type to store the values. Using a floating-point data type could lead to incorrect results.
2. **Not using a loop to iterate over the array.** The problem requires the developer to find a number that divides all the elements of the array. To do this, the developer needs to iterate over the array and check if each element is divisible by the number.
3. **Not using the `gcd()` function.** The `gcd()` function can be used to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers. This can be used to find a number that divides all the elements of the array.
4. **Not handling the case where there is no common divisor.** It is possible that there is no number that divides all the elements of the array. In this case, the developer should print `-1`.
5. **Not using the `min()` function.** The `min()` function can be used to find the minimum element of the array. This can be used to find a number that is smaller than all the elements of the array.

CODEFORCES 321_D. Ciel and Flipboard

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a single integer n, followed by n lines of n integers each. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer, the maximum sum of numbers in the board that can be accomplished by applying the flipboard operation. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce the correct answer.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum sum.** The maximum sum of numbers in the board can be calculated by summing the absolute values of all the numbers in the board, then multiplying that sum by -1. If the calculation is incorrect, the program will not produce the correct answer.
4. **Incorrect use of the flipboard operation.** The flipboard operation can only be applied to sub-boards with an odd number of rows and columns. If the flipboard operation is applied to a sub-board with an even number of rows or columns, the program will not produce the correct answer.
5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem, such as incorrect use of pointers, memory leaks, and race conditions. It is important to carefully check the code for these types of errors before submitting it for grading.

Title:
CODEFORCES 346_B. Lucky Common Subsequence

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of dynamic programming.** The most common mistake when solving this problem is to use dynamic programming incorrectly. For example, you might try to create a table of size `|s1|+1 x |s2|+1` and fill it with the lengths of the longest common subsequences ending at each position in `s1` and `s2`. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the longest common subsequence of `s1` and `s2` might not be contiguous.
2. **Incorrect handling of the virus string.** Another common mistake is to incorrectly handle the virus string. For example, you might try to remove all occurrences of the virus string from `s1` and `s2` before finding the longest common subsequence. However, this approach is incorrect because it might remove some of the characters that are needed to form the longest common subsequence.
3. **Incorrect use of the memoization technique.** The memoization technique can be used to speed up the computation of the longest common subsequence. However, it is important to use the memoization technique correctly. For example, you might try to memoize the lengths of the longest common subsequences of all possible prefixes of `s1` and `s2`. However, this approach is incorrect because it will not take into account the fact that the longest common subsequence of `s1` and `s2` might not be contiguous.
4. **Incorrect use of the backtracking technique.** The backtracking technique can be used to find the longest common subsequence of `s1` and `s2`. However, it is important to use the backtracking technique correctly. For example, you might try to backtrack through all possible ways of constructing the longest common subsequence. However, this approach is incorrect because it might not find the shortest possible longest common subsequence.
5. **Incorrect use of the divide and conquer technique.** The divide and conquer technique can be used to find the longest common subsequence of `s1` and `s2`. However, it is important to use the divide and conquer technique correctly. For example, you might try to divide `s1` and `s2` into two halves and then find the longest common subsequences of the two halves. However, this approach is incorrect because it might not find the longest possible longest common subsequence.

Here are some tips for avoiding these common problems and bugs:

1. **Use dynamic programming correctly.** When using dynamic programming to solve this problem, it is important to create a table of size `|s1|+1 x |s2|+1` and fill it with the lengths of the longest common subsequences ending at each position in `s1` and `s2`. You should also make sure to take into account the fact that the longest common subsequence of `s1` and `s2` might not be contiguous.
2. **Handle the virus string correctly.** When handling the virus string, you should make sure to remove all occurrences of the virus string from `s1` and `s2`. However, you should also make sure not to remove any of the characters that are needed to form the longest common subsequence.
3. **Use the memoization technique correctly.** When using the memoization technique, it is important to memoize the lengths of the longest common subsequences of all possible prefixes of `s1` and `s2`. You should also make sure to take into account the fact that the longest common subsequence of `s1` and `s2` might not be contiguous.
4. **Use the backtracking technique correctly.** When using the backtracking technique, it is important to backtrack through all possible ways of constructing the longest common subsequence. However, you should also make sure not to backtrack through any paths that will not lead to the longest possible longest common subsequence.
5. **Use the divide and conquer technique correctly.** When using the divide and conquer technique, it is important to divide `s1` and `s2` into two halves. You should also make sure to take into account the fact that the longest common subsequence of `s1` and `s2` might not be contiguous.

CODEFORCES 486_D. Valid Sets

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The tree traversal algorithm should visit each node exactly once, and it should not visit any node more than once.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of valid sets.** The number of valid sets can be calculated by multiplying the number of ways to choose the root node by the number of ways to choose the remaining nodes. However, it is important to remember that the number of ways to choose the remaining nodes is not simply the number of nodes minus one, because some of the nodes may not be adjacent to the root node.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement specifies that the number of nodes in the tree must be at least 1 and at most 2000. It is important to check for these edge cases and handle them appropriately.
4. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic.** The problem statement specifies that the output must be modulo 1000000007. It is important to make sure that all calculations are performed modulo 1000000007, and that the final answer is also modulo 1000000007.
5. **Incorrect use of the bitwise operators.** The bitwise operators &, |, and ^ can be used to perform a variety of operations on binary numbers. It is important to understand how these operators work and to use them correctly.
6. **Incorrect use of the bitmask data structure.** The bitmask data structure can be used to represent a set of bits. It is important to understand how this data structure works and to use it correctly.
7. **Incorrect use of the dynamic programming algorithm.** The dynamic programming algorithm can be used to solve a variety of problems. It is important to understand how this algorithm works and to use it correctly.
8. **Incorrect use of the memoization technique.** The memoization technique can be used to speed up the execution of a recursive algorithm. It is important to understand how this technique works and to use it correctly.
9. **Incorrect use of the divide and conquer algorithm.** The divide and conquer algorithm can be used to solve a variety of problems. It is important to understand how this algorithm works and to use it correctly.
10. **Incorrect use of the greedy algorithm.** The greedy algorithm can be used to solve a variety of problems. It is important to understand how this algorithm works and to use it correctly.

CODEFORCES 50_C. Happy Farm 5

Pain points:
1. **Inaccuracy of input data.** The input data may contain invalid values, such as negative coordinates or coordinates that are too large. The developer should check the input data for validity and handle invalid values appropriately.
2. **Incorrect algorithm.** The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm for finding the minimum number of moves. The algorithm should take into account the fact that the shepherd can only move in integer increments, and that the cows cannot be moved.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** The developer may make off-by-one errors when calculating the minimum number of moves. For example, the developer may forget to add one to the number of moves when the shepherd turns a corner.
4. **Memory leaks.** The developer may not free memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
5. **Synchronization issues.** The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data between multiple threads. This can lead to data corruption or deadlocks.

CODEFORCES 701_B. Cells Not Under Attack

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly, and that you are handling any errors that may occur. For example, if the input file does not have the correct format, your program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also very specific. It is important to make sure that you are printing the output in the correct format, and that you are not printing any extra information. For example, if you print the number of cells that are not under attack, you must also print a newline character after the number.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

One common mistake that programmers make when solving problems like this is to make an off-by-one error. For example, if you are counting the number of cells that are not under attack, you might accidentally start counting at 0 instead of 1. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**4. Undefined behavior**

Another common mistake that programmers make when solving problems like this is to create undefined behavior. Undefined behavior is behavior that is not specified by the C++ standard, and it can lead to unpredictable results. For example, if you divide by zero, your program will likely crash.

**5. Memory leaks**

It is important to make sure that you are not creating any memory leaks in your program. A memory leak occurs when you allocate memory for something, but you do not free that memory when you are done with it. This can eventually lead to your program running out of memory and crashing.

**6. Runtime errors**

Another common mistake that programmers make when solving problems like this is to create runtime errors. A runtime error occurs when your program tries to do something that is impossible, such as dividing by zero. Runtime errors can also occur when you try to access memory that you do not have permission to access.

**7. Logical errors**

Finally, it is important to make sure that your program is free of logical errors. A logical error occurs when your program does not do what you intended it to do. For example, if you are writing a program to calculate the area of a circle, but you accidentally use the formula for the circumference, your program will produce an incorrect answer.
Test inputs:
```
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    int a[n][n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            a[i][j] = 0;
        }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        int x, y;
        cin >> x >> y;
        a[x - 1][y - 1] = 1;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (a[i][j] == 0) {
                int count = 0;
                for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                    if (a[i][k] == 1) {
                        count++;
                    }
                    if (a[k][j] == 1) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
                if (i == j) {
                    count--;
                }
                if (i + j == n - 1) {
                    count--;
                }
                cout << n * n - n - count << endl;
            }
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This program has the following potential problems:

1. Incorrect input format. The program does not check to make sure that the input is in the correct format. For example, if the input file does not have two integers on the first line, the program will crash.
2. Incorrect output format. The program does not print the output in the correct format. For example, the program does not print a newline character after each number.
3. Off-by-one errors. The program makes an off-by-one error when it calculates the number of cells that are not under attack. For example, if the input is 3 3 1 1 3 1 2 2, the program will print 4 instead of 5.
4. Undefined behavior. The program creates undefined behavior when it divides by zero. For example, if the input is 1 1, the program will divide by zero when it calculates the number of cells that are not under attack in the first row.
5. Memory leaks. The program creates a memory leak when it allocates memory for the array `a`. The program does not free this memory when it is done with it, which can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. Runtime errors. The program creates a runtime error when it tries to access memory that it does not have permission to access. For example, if the input is 3 3 1 1 3 1 2 2, the program will try to access the memory at `a[3][3]`, which is outside the bounds of the array `a`.
7. Logical errors. The program has a logical error when it calculates the number of cells that are not under attack. For example, if the input is 3 3 1 1 3 1 2 2, the program will incorrectly count the cell at `(1, 1)` as being under attack, even though it is not.

The following program inputs will validate whether an implementation meets each of these requirements:

1. Incorrect input format:
```
1 1
```
This input file does not have two integers on the first line, so the program will crash.
2. Incorrect output format:
```
3 3 1 1 3 1 2 2
```
This output file does not print a newline character after each number, so the program will fail the test.
3. Off-by-one errors:
```
3 3 1 1 3 1 2 2
```
The program will print 4 instead of 5, which is an off-by-one error.
4. Undefined behavior:
```
1 1
```
The program will divide by zero when it calculates the number of cells that are not under attack in the first row, which is undefined behavior.
5. Memory leaks:
```
3 3 1 1 3 1 2 2
```
The program will create a memory leak when it allocates memory for the array `a

Title:
CODEFORCES 768_D. Jon and Orbs

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the binary search algorithm.** The binary search algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that can be used to find the position of a target value in a sorted array. However, if the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the algorithm does not check for the boundary conditions, it may return an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect use of the `pow()` function.** The `pow()` function in Python raises a number to a given power. However, if the exponent is negative, the `pow()` function will return a complex number. This can lead to incorrect results if the developer is not expecting a complex number.
3. **Incorrect use of the `math.ceil()` function.** The `math.ceil()` function in Python rounds a number up to the nearest integer. However, if the number is exactly halfway between two integers, the `math.ceil()` function will round the number up. This can lead to incorrect results if the developer is not expecting the number to be rounded up.
4. **Incorrect use of the `math.log()` function.** The `math.log()` function in Python returns the natural logarithm of a number. However, if the number is negative, the `math.log()` function will return a complex number. This can lead to incorrect results if the developer is not expecting a complex number.
5. **Incorrect use of the `math.exp()` function.** The `math.exp()` function in Python returns the exponential function of a number. However, if the number is negative, the `math.exp()` function will return a complex number. This can lead to incorrect results if the developer is not expecting a complex number.
6. **Incorrect use of the `math.factorial()` function.** The `math.factorial()` function in Python returns the factorial of a number. However, if the number is negative, the `math.factorial()` function will raise an error. This can lead to incorrect results if the developer is not expecting an error.

Title:
CODEFORCES 812_E. Sagheer and Apple Tree

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect data type

The input data is a list of integers. However, the code below is trying to convert it to a list of strings. This will cause an error.

```
n = int(input())
a = list(input().split())
p = list(input().split())
```

To fix this, we need to change the code to:

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
p = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

### 2. Incorrect index

The code below is trying to access the element at index 0 of the list `p`. However, the list is empty, so this will cause an error.

```
if a[0] % 2 == 0:
    print(n - 2)
else:
    print(n - 1)
```

To fix this, we need to check if the list is empty first. We can do this by using the `len()` function.

```
if len(p) == 0:
    print(0)
else:
    if a[0] % 2 == 0:
        print(n - 2)
    else:
        print(n - 1)
```

### 3. Off-by-one error

The code below is trying to access the element at index `n - 1` of the list `p`. However, this is out of bounds, so this will cause an error.

```
if a[n - 1] % 2 == 0:
    print(n - 2)
else:
    print(n - 1)
```

To fix this, we need to change the index to `n - 2`.

```
if a[n - 2] % 2 == 0:
    print(n - 2)
else:
    print(n - 1)
```

### 4. Uninitialized variable

The code below is trying to use the variable `v` before it has been initialized. This will cause an error.

```
if a[0] % 2 == 0:
    print(n - 2)
else:
    print(n - 1)
    v = p[n - 1]
```

To fix this, we need to initialize the variable `v` before using it.

```
if a[0] % 2 == 0:
    print(n - 2)
else:
    v = p[n - 1]
    print(n - 1)

Title:
CODEFORCES 838_E. Convex Countour

Pain points:
**1. The input may not be valid**. For example, the input may contain a negative number, or a number that is too large. The developer should check the input for validity and raise an error if it is not valid.
2. The developer may not correctly implement the algorithm for finding the longest non-intersecting path. The algorithm is not trivial, and there are a number of ways to implement it incorrectly. The developer should carefully read the algorithm and make sure that they understand it before implementing it.
3. The developer may not correctly calculate the length of the longest non-intersecting path. The length of the path is a floating-point number, and the developer should use the correct rounding rules to ensure that the output is accurate.
4. The developer may not correctly format the output. The output should be a single floating-point number, and it should be rounded to the correct number of decimal places.
5. The developer may not submit their code in the correct format. The code should be written in a programming language that is supported by Codeforces, and it should be formatted according to the Codeforces style guide.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer may incorrectly check the input for validity. For example, they may not check if the number of points is within the specified range.
* The developer may incorrectly implement the algorithm for finding the longest non-intersecting path. For example, they may not correctly handle the case where the points are collinear.
* The developer may incorrectly calculate the length of the longest non-intersecting path. For example, they may not correctly round the output to the correct number of decimal places.
* The developer may incorrectly format the output. For example, they may not include the correct number of decimal places.
* The developer may not submit their code in the correct format. For example, they may not use a programming language that is supported by Codeforces, or they may not format their code according to the Codeforces style guide.

CODEFORCES 908_C. New Year and Curling

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type.** The input data is given as two integers and a list of integers. However, the developer may mistakenly read the input data as a list of strings, which will lead to incorrect results.
2. **Off-by-one error.** When computing the y-coordinate of the center of a disk, the developer may mistakenly use the index of the previous disk instead of the current disk. This will lead to an incorrect result.
3. **Incorrect calculation.** The developer may mistakenly use the wrong formula to calculate the y-coordinate of the center of a disk. This will lead to an incorrect result.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The developer may mistakenly print the output in the wrong format. This will cause the checker program to fail.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The developer may not handle errors correctly. This may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. The developer should also carefully write the code and test it thoroughly.
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect data type**
```
n, r = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
x = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
y = []
for i in range(n):

        if x[i] == x[j]:
            y[j] = min(y[j], y[i] - 2 * r - 1)
print(*y)
```

This program will fail because it uses the index of the previous disk instead of the current disk when computing the y-coordinate of the center of a disk. This will lead to an incorrect result.

3. **Incorrect calculation**
```
n, r = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
x = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
y = []
for i in range(n):
    y.append(10100 - 2 * r)
for i in range(n-1):
    for j in range(i+1, n):
        if x[i] == x[j]:
            y[j] = min(y[j], y[i] - 2 * r - 2)
print(*y)
```

This program will fail because it uses the wrong formula to calculate the y-coordinate of the center of a disk. This will lead to an incorrect result.

4. **Incorrect output format**
```
n, r = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
x = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
y = []
for i in range(n):
    y.append(10100 - 2 * r)
for i in range(n-1):
    for j in range(i+1, n):
        if x[i] == x[j]:
            y[j] = min(y[j], y[i] - 2 * r - 3)
print(" ".join(map(str, y)))
```

This program will fail because it prints the output in the wrong format. This will cause the checker program to fail.

5. **Incorrect error handling**
```
n, r = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
x = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
y = []
for i in range(n):
    y.append(10100 - 2 * r)
for i in range(n-1):
    for j in range(i+1, n):
        if x[i] == x[j]:
            y[j] = min(y[j], y[i] - 2 * r - 4)
raise Exception("Error")
```

This program will fail because it does not handle errors correctly. This may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

Here are some correct program inputs that will validate whether an implementation meets each of the requirements:

1. **Correct data type**
```
n, r = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
x = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
y = []
for i in range(n):
    y.append(10100 - 2 * r)
for i in range(n-1):
    for j in range(i+1, n):
        if x[i] == x[j]:
            y[j] = min(y[j], y[i] - 2 *

CODEFORCES 92_B. Binary Number

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be a positive integer in binary system. Make sure that your code can handle any valid input.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer representing the number of actions Fangy should perform to get a number one from number x. Make sure that your code outputs the correct answer.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm you use to solve the problem may be incorrect. Make sure that your algorithm is correct and that it terminates in finite time.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. When counting the number of actions, it is easy to make a mistake and count one action too many or too few. Make sure that you are careful when counting the number of actions.
5. **Memory leaks**. Your code may allocate memory that it does not free, leading to a memory leak. Make sure that your code does not leak memory.
6. **Race conditions**. If your code is multi-threaded, it is possible that two threads could access the same data at the same time and corrupt it. Make sure that your code is thread-safe.
7. **Deadlocks**. If your code is multi-threaded, it is possible that two threads could get stuck waiting for each other to release a lock, leading to a deadlock. Make sure that your code does not deadlock.
8. **Other bugs**. There are many other possible bugs that a developer could encounter when solving this problem. Be careful and make sure that your code is correct.

CODEFORCES 958_A3. Death Stars (hard)

Pain points:
Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading in the data. For example, if you forget to read in the number of Death Stars, or if you read in the coordinates of the stars in the wrong format, your program will not work correctly.
* **Incorrect algorithm:** The algorithm for solving this problem is not trivial, and it is easy to make a mistake in your implementation. For example, if you forget to take into account the rotation and translation of the stars, or if you do not correctly compare the stars to each other, your program will not produce the correct output.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format for this problem is also very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if you forget to print the number of Death Stars, or if you print the stars in the wrong order, your program will not be graded correctly.
* **Runtime errors:** This problem can be solved in polynomial time, but it is still possible to make a mistake in your implementation that will cause your program to run in exponential time. For example, if you use an inefficient algorithm to find the correspondence between the stars on the two maps, your program will not be able to solve the problem in time.
* **Memory errors:** This problem does not require a lot of memory, but it is still possible to make a mistake in your implementation that will cause your program to run out of memory. For example, if you do not properly free up memory after you are finished using it, your program will eventually crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 983_B. XOR-pyramid

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the XOR operation.** The XOR operation is a binary operator that returns the value of one operand if both operands are equal, and the value of the other operand otherwise. In C++, the XOR operator is represented by the bitwise exclusive OR operator (^). For example, the following code will return the value 5:

```c++
int a = 3;
int b = 2;
cout << a ^ b << endl;
```

However, if you accidentally use the regular addition operator (+) instead of the bitwise exclusive OR operator (^), the code will return the value 5 + 2 = 7. This can lead to incorrect results in your program.

2. **Using a naïve approach to solve the problem.** The naive approach to solving this problem would be to iterate over all possible subsegments of the array and calculate the value of the XOR function for each subsegment. This would be a very inefficient algorithm, as the number of subsegments grows exponentially with the length of the array.

3. **Not using a data structure that is optimized for this type of problem.** The XOR function is a associative function, which means that the order of the operands does not matter. This means that we can use a data structure that stores the values of the XOR function for all possible pairs of elements in the array. This will allow us to quickly calculate the value of the XOR function for any subsegment of the array.

4. **Not handling corner cases correctly.** There are a few corner cases that you need to be aware of when solving this problem. For example, what happens if the array is empty? What happens if the query range is empty? What happens if the query range goes beyond the end of the array? You need to make sure that your code handles these cases correctly.

5. **Using incorrect variable types.** The XOR function can return very large values, so you need to make sure that you use the correct variable types to store the values of the XOR function. For example, if you are using C++, you should use the `unsigned long long` type to store the values of the XOR function.

6. **Not using a constant time algorithm.** The XOR function is a constant time function, which means that it takes the same amount of time to calculate the value of the XOR function for any two elements in the array. This means that you can use a constant time algorithm to solve this problem.

Title:
HACKEREARTH bitwise-1

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong operator**

The XOR operator is a binary operator that returns a 1 if the two bits are different and a 0 if they are the same. In this problem, we need to find the Kth key in the list of positive integers that satisfy the equation X + Y = X ⊕ Y. The wrong operator to use here is the addition operator, as this will not give the correct result.

**2. Using the wrong order of operations**

When evaluating an expression with multiple operators, it is important to use the correct order of operations. In this problem, we need to first evaluate the XOR operation, and then add the result to X. If we add X to Y first, and then XOR the result with X, we will get the wrong answer.

**3. Using the wrong data type**

The data type used to store the values of X and Y must be large enough to accommodate the largest possible value. In this problem, the largest possible value of X and Y is 10^14. Therefore, we need to use a data type that can store numbers up to this size.

**4. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve this problem must be correct in order to get the correct answer. A common mistake is to use an algorithm that only works for a specific range of values. For example, an algorithm that only works for values of X and Y that are less than 100 will not work for this problem.

**5. Not handling edge cases**

It is important to handle edge cases when solving a problem. In this problem, there are two edge cases that need to be considered:

* The case where X is equal to 0.
* The case where K is equal to 0.

If these edge cases are not handled correctly, the program will not produce the correct output.

HACKEREARTH crazy-numbers-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulo operation**. The modulo operation is used to find the remainder of a division operation. In this problem, the output can become large, so we need to take modulo with 10^9+7. For example, if the output is 1000000009, then the modulo operation will return 9. However, if the output is 1000000008, then the modulo operation will return 8. This is because 1000000008 mod 10^9+7 = 8.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of crazy numbers**. The number of crazy numbers for a given number of digits can be calculated using the following formula:

```
N = (10^(n-1) * (10^(n-1) + 1)) / 2
```

where N is the number of crazy numbers and n is the number of digits. For example, the number of crazy numbers for 3 digits is (10^2 * (10^2 + 1)) / 2 = 17.
3. **Incorrect use of the mod operator**. The mod operator is used to find the remainder of a division operation. In this problem, the output can become large, so we need to take modulo with 10^9+7. For example, if the output is 1000000009, then the modulo operation will return 9. However, if the output is 1000000008, then the modulo operation will return 8. This is because 1000000008 mod 10^9+7 = 8.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrectly counting the number of 1s and 0s in the matrix.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. To avoid this, make sure to carefully count the number of each type of value in the matrix.
2. **Not considering all possible moves.** When trying to find the minimum number of moves required to flip the entire matrix, it is important to consider all possible moves. This means considering all possible pairs of coordinates (x, y) for the top-left and bottom-right corners of the rectangle to be flipped.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. However, not all algorithms are guaranteed to find the optimal solution. It is important to choose an algorithm that is both efficient and accurate.
4. **Misunderstanding the problem statement.** The problem statement is clear and concise, but it is still possible to misunderstand it. Make sure to carefully read and understand the problem statement before attempting to solve it.
5. **Making a careless mistake.** Even the most careful programmers can make mistakes. It is important to carefully check your code for errors before submitting it.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly specified. For example, the input format of this problem is not clear about whether the numbers in the second line are separated by spaces or commas. This can lead to errors if the developer does not correctly parse the input.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not always correctly specified. For example, this problem does not specify whether the output should be a single integer or a list of integers. This can lead to errors if the developer does not correctly format the output.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the developer may incorrectly calculate the number of concerts that Mike can perform. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are common when the developer forgets to account for the first or last element in an array or list. This can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Indexing errors**. Indexing errors occur when the developer incorrectly accesses an element in an array or list. This can lead to incorrect results.
6. **Null pointer exceptions**. Null pointer exceptions occur when the developer attempts to access a null pointer. This can lead to the program crashing.
7. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when the developer does not free up memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
8. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads attempt to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
9. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can lead to the program running indefinitely or crashing.
10. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can occur when the developer does not properly protect sensitive data. This can lead to attackers gaining access to sensitive data or the ability to execute arbitrary code on the system.

Title:
HACKEREARTH p1-6

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of data types**

When working with strings, it is important to be aware of the different data types that are available. In Python, strings are represented as a sequence of characters, and each character is stored as a single byte. This means that if you try to perform mathematical operations on a string, such as adding two strings together, you will get an error.

To avoid this problem, you can convert the string to a list of characters before performing any mathematical operations. For example, the following code would convert the string "abc" to a list of characters:

```python
s = "abc"
l = list(s)
print(l)
```

Output:

```
['a', 'b', 'c']
```

**2. Off-by-one errors**

When working with arrays, it is easy to make off-by-one errors. This is because the index of the first element in an array is 0, not 1. This means that if you try to access the element at index 1, you will actually be accessing the element at index 0.

To avoid this problem, it is important to be careful when indexing into arrays. You can use the `len()` function to get the length of an array, and then use that to calculate the correct index. For example, the following code would print the first element in the array `a`:

```python
a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(a[0])
```

Output:

```
1
```

**3. Using the wrong data structure**

When solving a problem, it is important to choose the right data structure for the job. For example, if you are trying to find the longest substring in a string, you would use a sliding window. If you are trying to find all of the occurrences of a pattern in a string, you would use a regular expression.

Choosing the wrong data structure can lead to inefficient code and incorrect results. It is important to take the time to understand the problem before you start coding, so that you can choose the right data structure for the job.

**4. Not using existing libraries**

There are many existing libraries that can be used to solve common problems. For example, the `collections` library in Python contains a number of useful data structures, such as the `defaultdict` and the `Counter`. The `re` library contains a number of functions for working with regular expressions.

Using existing libraries can save you a lot of time and effort. It is important to be aware of the existing libraries that are available, and to use them when appropriate.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before you deploy it to production. This will help you to catch any bugs before they cause problems for your users. There are a number of different ways to test your code, such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.

Testing your code will help you to ensure that it is working correctly, and that it is meeting the requirements of your users. It is important to make testing a part of your development process, so that you can catch bugs early and prevent them from causing problems.

def tom_and_coins(a, k, n):
    coins = a + k * (n - 1)
    return coins
```

**4. Uncaught exception:** The code below does not handle the case where `a`, `k`, or `n` is less than 1. This will cause the code to throw an `IndexError` exception.

```
def tom_and_coins(a, k, n):
    coins = a + k * (n - 1)
    return coins

if __name__ == "__main__":
    a, k, n = map(int, input().split())
    print(tom_and_coins(a, k, n))
```

**5. Inefficient code:** The code below is inefficient because it uses a `for` loop to iterate over the range of values from 1 to `n`. This is unnecessary, as we can simply calculate the number of coins Tom will have on his birthday using the formula `a + k * (n - 1)`.

```
def tom_and_coins(a, k, n):
    coins = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        coins += a + k * (i - 1)
    return coins
```

**6. Unclear code:** The code below is unclear because it does not use descriptive variable names. This makes it difficult to understand what the code is doing.

```
def tom_and_coins(a, k, n):
    coins = a + k * (n - 1)
    return coins
```

**7. Untested code:** The code below has not been tested, which means that there is no way to know if it is correct. This is a serious problem, as it could lead to incorrect results being produced.

    coins = a + k * (n - 1)
    return coins

if __name__ == "__main__":
    a, k, n = map(int, input().split())
    print(tom_and_coins(a, k, n))
```

**8. Insecure code:** The code below is insecure because it does not use any input validation. This means that it is vulnerable to attack by malicious users.

```
def tom_and_coins(a, k, n):
    coins = a + k * (n - 1)
    return coins

if __name__ == "__main__":
    a, k, n = map(int, input().split())
    print(tom_and_coins(a, k, n))
```

**9. Undocumented code:** The code below is undocumented, which means that there is no way for users to know how to use it. This is a serious problem, as it could lead to users using the code incorrectly.

```
def tom_and_coins(a, k, n):
    coins = a + k * (n - 1)
    return coins
```

**10. Over-engineered code:** The code below is over-engineered because it uses more complex data structures and algorithms than are necessary to solve the problem. This can make the code more difficult to understand and maintain.

```

Title:
ATCODER p02565 AtCoder Library Practice Contest - Two SAT

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly followed. For example, the input may not have the correct number of elements, or the elements may not be in the correct format.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may not be in the correct data type. For example, the input may contain a string when it should contain an integer.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the logic may not account for all possible cases.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The logic may be correct, but it may be off by one. For example, the logic may check if the distance between two flags is at least D, but it may actually be D - 1.
5. **Infinite loop**. The logic may enter an infinite loop. This can happen if the logic is not properly terminated.
6. **Stack overflow**. The logic may cause a stack overflow. This can happen if the logic recursively calls itself too many times.
7. **Memory leak**. The logic may leak memory. This can happen if the logic does not properly free memory that it has allocated.
8. **Race condition**. The logic may experience a race condition. This can happen if two threads or processes try to access the same data at the same time.
9. **Deadlock**. The logic may deadlock. This can happen if two threads or processes are waiting for each other to release a lock.
10. **Security vulnerability**. The logic may contain a security vulnerability. This can happen if the logic allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to data or systems.

Title:
ATCODER p02696 AtCoder Beginner Contest 165 - Floor Function

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the floor function.** The floor function returns the largest integer less than or equal to its argument. This means that if the argument is not an integer, the floor function will return the integer that is closest to it. For example, the floor function of 3.5 is 3, and the floor function of 4.5 is 4.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum possible value.** The maximum possible value of floor(Ax/B) - A × floor(x/B) is given by the following formula:

```
max(0, A - B)
```

This is because the floor function of a non-negative integer will always be less than or equal to the integer itself, and the product of two integers will always be greater than or equal to the smaller integer.
3. **Incorrect input handling.** The input format for this problem specifies that the integers A, B, and N should be separated by spaces. If the input is not formatted correctly, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce an incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect output formatting.** The output for this problem should be a single integer. If the output is not formatted correctly, the judge will not be able to correctly evaluate the solution.
5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other potential bugs that a developer could encounter when solving this problem. These include:

* Using the wrong data type for the input or output values.
* Making a mistake in the logic of the program.
* Forgetting to handle special cases.
* Using an incorrect algorithm.

By carefully considering the potential problems and bugs that could occur when solving this problem, developers can significantly reduce the risk of making mistakes.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed. For example, the output may contain extra spaces or tabs.
3. **Incorrect solution**. The solution does not satisfy the problem constraints. For example, the solution may not place any dominoes, or the solution may place dominoes in a way that violates the problem constraints.
4. **Memory leak**. The solution may allocate memory that is never freed, leading to a memory leak.
5. **Thread safety**. The solution may not be thread-safe, leading to incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data simultaneously.
6. **Security vulnerability**. The solution may contain a security vulnerability, such as a buffer overflow or a SQL injection vulnerability.
7. **Incorrect error handling**. The solution may not handle errors correctly, leading to incorrect results or a program crash.
8. **Unnecessary complexity**. The solution may be unnecessarily complex, making it difficult to understand and maintain.

Title:
ATCODER p02962 AtCoder Beginner Contest 135 - Strings of Eternity

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input strings can be very long, so it is important to use the correct data type to store them. Using a small data type like `char` or `string` could lead to overflow errors.

**2. Not handling the case where `t` is a substring of `s`**

If `t` is a substring of `s`, then the number of non-negative integers `i` satisfying the condition is infinite. It is important to check for this case and handle it appropriately.

**3. Not handling the case where `t` is not a substring of `s`**

If `t` is not a substring of `s`, then the number of non-negative integers `i` satisfying the condition is finite. It is important to find the maximum value of `i` in this case.

**4. Using a brute-force approach**

The brute-force approach to solving this problem would be to try every possible value of `i` and check if the concatenation of `i` copies of `t` is a substring of the concatenation of `j` copies of `s`. This approach would be very inefficient, as it would require a time complexity of O(N^2), where `N` is the length of `s`.

**5. Using a divide-and-conquer approach**

A more efficient approach to solving this problem would be to use a divide-and-conquer approach. This approach would involve recursively dividing the problem into smaller and smaller subproblems, until each subproblem can be solved in a straightforward way. This approach would have a time complexity of O(N log N), which is much more efficient than the brute-force approach.

**6. Using a dynamic programming approach**

A even more efficient approach to solving this problem would be to use a dynamic programming approach. This approach would involve creating a table of values that stores the maximum value of `i` that satisfies the condition for each possible prefix of `s`. This approach would have a time complexity of O(N), which is the most efficient possible time complexity.

Title:
ATCODER p03396 AtCoder Grand Contest 022 - Shopping

Pain points:
**Possible Problems and Bugs:**

1. **Off-by-one error**. When computing the time to travel from one station to another, it is important to take into account the fact that the train will stop at the destination station. This means that the time to travel from one station to another is one second longer than the distance between the two stations.
2. **Incorrectly computing the minimum time to visit all shopping centers**. When computing the minimum time to visit all shopping centers, it is important to take into account the fact that Yui can start shopping at a shopping center as soon as she arrives at the station that serves that shopping center. This means that the minimum time to visit all shopping centers is not necessarily the same as the maximum time to visit all shopping centers.
3. **Incorrectly computing the time to return home**. When computing the time to return home, it is important to take into account the fact that the train will stop at the station at coordinate 0. This means that the time to return home is one second longer than the distance between the station at coordinate 0 and the last shopping center visited.
4. **Incorrectly handling the case where the train is at the same station as Yui**. When the train is at the same station as Yui, it is important to take into account the fact that Yui can immediately board the train without having to wait for it to arrive. This means that the time to board the train is zero.
5. **Incorrectly handling the case where Yui is at the same station as a shopping center**. When Yui is at the same station as a shopping center, it is important to take into account the fact that Yui can immediately start shopping without having to wait for the train to arrive. This means that the time to start shopping is zero.

By carefully avoiding these potential problems and bugs, you can write a correct and efficient solution to this problem.

Title:
ATCODER p03561 AtCoder Regular Contest 084 - Finite Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the input or output.** The input and output of this problem are both lists of integers. If you use the wrong data type, such as a string or a float, your program will not work correctly.
2. **Not handling the edge cases.** The input to this problem can be any two integers between 1 and 3\*10^5. If you do not handle the edge cases, such as when K or N is equal to 1, your program will not work correctly.
3. **Using an inefficient algorithm.** The naive algorithm for solving this problem would be to enumerate all possible sequences of length N and then sort them lexicographically. This algorithm would have a time complexity of O(N\*K^N), which is too slow for large values of N and K.
4. **Making a mistake in your code.** This is always a possibility, even for experienced programmers. Be careful to check your code carefully for errors before submitting it.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* Using a string to store the input list of integers. This will cause the program to crash when it tries to sort the list.
* Not checking for the edge case where K or N is equal to 1. This will cause the program to output an incorrect answer.
* Using a bubble sort algorithm to sort the list of integers. This algorithm is very inefficient and will take a long time to run for large values of N and K.
* Misspelling a variable name or using the wrong data type. This will cause the program to crash or output an incorrect answer.

By avoiding these common problems, you can increase your chances of writing a correct and efficient solution to this problem.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

There are a few different ways to solve this problem, but not all of them are correct. For example, you might try to solve the problem by brute force, which would be very inefficient.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement does not specify any edge cases, but there are a few that you should be aware of. For example, what happens if N is equal to 1? What happens if the input contains duplicate numbers?

**5. Not testing your code**

It is always important to test your code before submitting it to a competition. This will help you to catch any bugs that you might have missed.

Title:
ATCODER p04037 AtCoder Grand Contest 002 - Candy Piles

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the game rules**

The most important thing to get right when solving this problem is to correctly implement the game rules. In particular, you need to make sure that you understand how the turns work and what each player can do.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

Another common mistake is to make an off-by-one error when counting the number of candies in a pile or the number of turns that have been taken. This can lead to incorrect results, so it's important to be careful when doing these calculations.

**3. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

The problem statement specifies some edge cases that you need to be aware of. For example, what happens if there is only one pile of candies? Or what happens if all of the piles have the same number of candies? You need to make sure that you handle these cases correctly in your code.

**4. Runtime errors**

Finally, you need to make sure that your code runs in a reasonable amount of time. This means that you need to avoid using inefficient algorithms and data structures.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that you might encounter when solving this problem:

* You might accidentally implement the game rules incorrectly, which could lead to incorrect results.
* You might make an off-by-one error when counting the number of candies in a pile or the number of turns that have been taken.
* You might incorrectly handle an edge case, which could lead to incorrect results.
* You might use an inefficient algorithm or data structure, which could cause your code to run too slowly.

By being aware of these possible problems, you can avoid them and write correct, efficient code.

AIZU p00251 Points for a Perfect Scorer

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The problem states that the input consists of 10 lines, and the i line is given the integer si (0 ≤ si ≤ 100) representing the score of problem i. However, if the developer incorrectly defines the variable type as a string, the program will not be able to correctly calculate the total score.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may accidentally forget to add 1 to the index of the current line when iterating through the input, resulting in an incorrect total score.
3. **Incorrect loop condition**. The developer may incorrectly set the loop condition to continue looping until the end of the file, instead of looping until the end of the 10th line. This will result in the program continuing to read data from the file after the 10th line, which will cause an error.
4. **Incorrect calculation**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the total score by adding the scores of the 10 lines together, instead of adding the scores of the 10 integers in each line together. This will result in an incorrect total score.
5. **Incorrect output**. The developer may incorrectly output the total score as a string, instead of an integer. This will cause the program to output an incorrect value.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may not have two lines, or the area and perimeter may not be integers.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When computing the area or perimeter of a rectangle, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, you might forget to subtract 1 from the x-coordinate of the upper right vertex when computing the width of the rectangle.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The logic used to compute the area or perimeter of a rectangle may be incorrect. For example, you might incorrectly assume that the area of a rectangle is equal to the product of its width and height.
5. **Memory errors**. If you are not careful, your program may run out of memory when processing large datasets.
6. **Time errors**. Your program may take too long to run on large datasets.
7. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers**. Floating-point numbers are often used to represent real numbers in computer programs. However, floating-point numbers are not always accurate, and this can lead to errors in your program.
8. **Incorrect use of pointers**. Pointers are a powerful tool in C++, but they can also be a source of errors. If you are not careful, you may accidentally dereference a null pointer or access memory that you do not own.
9. **Incorrect use of exceptions**. Exceptions are a way to handle errors in C++. However, if you are not careful, you may accidentally throw an exception that your program cannot handle.
10. **Incorrect use of threads**. Threads are a way to run multiple parts of your program concurrently. However, if you are not careful, you may accidentally create a race condition or deadlock.

        v[i] = {x1, y1, x2, y2};
    }

    int area = 0, perimeter = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int width = v[i][2] - v[i][0];
        int height = v[i][3] - v[i][1];
        area += width * height;
        perimeter += 2 * (width + height);
    }

    if (r == 1) {

Pain points:
Here are the most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly handling the input data.** The input data may contain invalid values, such as non-numeric values, unit prefixes that are not recognized by the program, or units that are not used in the International System of Units (SI). The developer must be careful to check the input data for errors and to handle them appropriately.
* **Incorrectly converting the input data to exponential notation.** The developer must be careful to correctly calculate the exponent of 10 in the exponential notation. The exponent must be such that the number of significant digits in the output is the same as the number of significant digits in the input.
* **Incorrectly handling the output data.** The developer must be careful to format the output data correctly. The output must be in the form of a * 10 ^ b [unit], where a is a number between 1 and 9, b is an integer, and unit is the name of the unit.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly handling non-numeric values.** The developer may incorrectly assume that all of the values in the input data are numeric. If a non-numeric value is encountered, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
* **Incorrectly handling unit prefixes that are not recognized by the program.** The developer may incorrectly assume that all of the unit prefixes in the input data are recognized by the program. If an unrecognized unit prefix is encountered, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
* **Incorrectly handling units that are not used in the International System of Units (SI).** The developer may incorrectly assume that all of the units in the input data are used in the International System of Units (SI). If a unit that is not used in the International System of Units (SI) is encountered, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

By carefully considering the possible problems and bugs that may occur when solving this problem, the developer can significantly reduce the risk of introducing errors into their code.

Title:
AIZU p02060 Four Tea

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The input format specifies that the number of players participating in the contest is an integer, but the code below assumes that it is a string. This will cause the code to crash when it tries to convert the input to an integer.
2. **Incorrect variable initialization.** The code below initializes the variable `min_cost` to a value of `0`. This is incorrect because the minimum cost could be any positive number.
3. **Incorrect comparison operator.** The code below uses the operator `>` to compare the values of `min_cost` and `cost`. This is incorrect because the operator `>` should be used to compare the values of two variables, not the values of a variable and a function call.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The code below checks if the value of `cost` is less than the value of `min_cost`. If it is, then the value of `min_cost` is updated to the value of `cost`. This is incorrect because the value of `min_cost` should only be updated if the value of `cost` is less than or equal to the value of `min_cost`.
5. **Incorrect output.** The code below outputs the value of `min_cost`. This is incorrect because the output should be the minimum cost required to make tea for `N` people.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```
N = int(input())
p_A, p_B, p_C, p_D = map(int, input().split())
t_A, t_B, t_C, t_D = map(int, input().split())

min_cost = float('inf')

Title:
AIZU p02202 Gag

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of binary search.** The binary search algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that can be used to find the position of a target value in a sorted array. However, if the implementation is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect use of pointers.** Pointers are a powerful tool that can be used to access memory locations directly. However, if they are not used correctly, they can lead to memory errors and security vulnerabilities.
3. **Incorrect handling of errors.** Errors are an inevitable part of programming, and it is important to handle them gracefully. If errors are not handled correctly, they can lead to programs crashing or producing incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect use of data structures.** Data structures are used to organize data in a way that makes it efficient to access and manipulate. However, if the wrong data structure is used, it can lead to performance problems and memory leaks.
5. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** Algorithms are used to solve problems efficiently. However, if the wrong algorithm is used, it can lead to incorrect results or slow performance.
6. **Incorrect testing.** Testing is essential to ensure that a program is working correctly. However, if the tests are not comprehensive, it can lead to bugs being missed.
7. **Incorrect documentation.** Documentation is essential to help other developers understand how to use a program. However, if the documentation is not clear or complete, it can lead to confusion and errors.

Title:
AIZU p02356 The Number of Windows

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the binary search algorithm.** The binary search algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that can be used to find the position of a target value in a sorted array. However, if the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results. For example, the following implementation of the binary search algorithm will not work correctly:

```
def binary_search(array, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(array) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if array[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif array[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

The problem with this implementation is that it does not check if the target value is in the array before calling the `while` loop. This means that if the target value is not in the array, the algorithm will never terminate.

2. **Using the wrong data structure.** The data structure that you use to solve a problem can have a significant impact on the performance of your code. For example, if you are trying to solve a problem that involves finding the maximum value in an array, you would want to use a data structure that allows you to quickly access the elements of the array. A hash table would be a good choice for this problem, as it allows you to access the elements of the array in constant time. On the other hand, if you are trying to solve a problem that involves finding the longest substring in a string, you would want to use a data structure that allows you to efficiently find all of the occurrences of a pattern in the string. A suffix tree would be a good choice for this problem, as it allows you to find all of the occurrences of a pattern in linear time.

3. **Not handling edge cases.** When you are writing code, it is important to handle all of the possible edge cases. An edge case is a situation that is not explicitly handled by the code, and it can cause the code to crash or produce incorrect results. For example, if you are writing code to sort an array, you need to handle the case where the array is empty. If you do not handle this case, the code will crash when it tries to access the first element of the array.

4. **Using too much memory.** When you are writing code, it is important to be aware of the amount of memory that your code is using. If your code uses too much memory, it can slow down your computer or even crash it. There are a few things that you can do to reduce the amount of memory that your code uses. First, you can use data structures that are more memory-efficient. Second, you can avoid allocating memory on the heap unless you absolutely need to. Third, you can free up memory that is no longer needed.

5. **Not using the right algorithm.** The algorithm that you use to solve a problem can have a significant impact on the performance of your code. For example, if you are trying to solve a problem that involves finding the shortest path in a graph, you would want to use a different algorithm than you would if you were trying to solve a problem that involves finding the maximum clique in a graph. There are a number of different algorithms that you can use to solve different types of problems. It is important to choose the right algorithm for the problem that you are trying to solve.

6. **Not testing your code.** Before you deploy your code to production, it is important to test it thoroughly. This will help you to catch any bugs that are in your code before they cause problems for your users. There are a number of different ways that you can test your code. You can manually test your code, or you can use automated testing tools.

7. **Not documenting your code.** When you write code, it is important to document it. This will help other developers to understand how your code works. There are a number of different ways that you can document your code. You can write comments in your code, or you can create a separate documentation file.
