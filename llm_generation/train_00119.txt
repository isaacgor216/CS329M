CODECHEF delish

Pain points:
**Possible Problems and Bugs:**

* The input data may not be correctly parsed.
* The code may not correctly handle negative values.
* The code may not correctly handle large values.
* The code may not be efficient enough.
* The code may not be correct.

Here are some specific examples of problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* The code may not correctly parse the input data if it is not in the correct format. For example, the code may not correctly parse the input data if it contains spaces between the numbers.
* The code may not correctly handle negative values. For example, the code may not correctly calculate the absolute value of a negative number.
* The code may not correctly handle large values. For example, the code may not correctly calculate the sum of a large number of numbers.
* The code may not be efficient enough. For example, the code may use a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem, which can be very inefficient for large input data sets.
* The code may not be correct. For example, the code may not correctly calculate the maximum delish value for the dish.

To avoid these problems and bugs, it is important to carefully design and implement the code. It is also important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and efficient.

Title:
CODECHEF iitk1p05

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data is a sequence of integers. If we use an incorrect data type to store the integers, we may get incorrect results. For example, if we use `int` to store the integers, we may get an overflow error when the integers are too large.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. If we use an incorrect algorithm, we may not get the correct answer. For example, we could use a brute-force algorithm to solve this problem, but this would be very inefficient.

**3. Not handling edge cases correctly**

There are some edge cases that we need to handle correctly when solving this problem. For example, if the input data is empty, we need to return `0`.

**4. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed.

**5. Not using efficient data structures**

Using efficient data structures can help you to solve this problem faster. For example, we could use a priority queue to find the maximum possible average value.

Title:
CODECHEF nbsum

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect logic**. The most common mistake is to forget to add or subtract the first term of the series. For example, if you are asked to find the sum of the first 10 terms of the series, you would need to add 1 to the sum of the first 9 terms.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. Another common mistake is to forget to increment or decrement the index when iterating through the series. For example, if you are iterating through the series from 1 to 10, you would need to increment the index by 1 each time.
3. **Incorrect data types**. Make sure that you are using the correct data types for your variables. For example, if you are trying to find the sum of a series of integers, you should use an integer variable to store the sum.
4. **Memory errors**. Make sure that you are allocating enough memory for your variables. For example, if you are trying to store the sum of a series of 1000 integers, you should allocate an array of size 1000 to store the sum.
5. **Runtime errors**. Make sure that your code is free of runtime errors. For example, make sure that you are closing files and freeing memory when you are finished with them.

Title:
CODECHEF rrmtrx2

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is two integers n and m, followed by n lines of m integers each. A common mistake is to forget to include the newline character after each line of input, which will cause the input to be interpreted incorrectly.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer, the sum of the values of all possible vectors. A common mistake is to output the sum of the values of only one vector, or to output the sum of the values of all vectors in a list.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the sum**

The sum of the values of all possible vectors can be calculated by multiplying each element of the first row of the matrix by each element of the second row, and then adding the products together. A common mistake is to forget to multiply each element by each element of the second row, or to add the products together incorrectly.

**4. Using the wrong modulo operator**

The output for this problem should be modulo 10^7 + 7. A common mistake is to use the wrong modulo operator, such as % or %%.

**5. Using the wrong data type**

The input and output for this problem should be integers. A common mistake is to use floating-point numbers, which will cause the output to be incorrect.

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or it may contain a word that is not in the alphabet.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correctly followed. For example, the output may not be a valid sentence, or it may not contain the correct answer.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect. For example, the program may not correctly check if the words can be arranged in a sequence, or it may not correctly check if all the words are used exactly once.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program may not correctly free up memory that it has allocated. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
5. **Race conditions**. The program may not be thread-safe. This can lead to incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may contain security vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.
7. **Bugs in third-party libraries**. The program may depend on third-party libraries that contain bugs. These bugs can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect results.
8. **Incorrect compiler settings**. The program may be compiled with incorrect compiler settings. This can lead to the program running incorrectly or to the program crashing.
9. **Incorrect operating system settings**. The program may be running on an operating system with incorrect settings. This can lead to the program running incorrectly or to the program crashing.
10. **Hardware problems**. The program may be running on hardware that is not functioning correctly. This can lead to the program running incorrectly or to the program crashing.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1020_E. Sergey's problem

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake and provide incorrect input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The input data is given as a string, so it is important to convert it to the correct data type before processing it. For example, if you try to add two strings, the program will get an error.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When working with arrays, it is easy to make off-by-one errors. For example, if you try to access the element at index n in an array of size n-1, the program will get an error.

**4. Undefined behavior**

When writing C++, it is important to be aware of undefined behavior. This is behavior that is not specified by the C++ standard and can lead to unexpected results. For example, if you try to divide by zero, the program will crash.

**5. Memory leaks**

When allocating memory, it is important to free it when you are finished with it. If you do not free the memory, it will leak and eventually lead to a memory overflow.

**6. Race conditions**

When multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is possible for a race condition to occur. This is when two threads try to access the same data at the same time and the results are unpredictable.

**7. Deadlocks**

When multiple threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, it is possible for a deadlock to occur. This is when the threads are stuck waiting for each other and the program cannot continue.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1044_A. The Tower is Going Home

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrectly counting the number of vertical and horizontal spells.** This is a common mistake that can be easily avoided by using a `set` data structure to store the spells.
* **Not considering all possible paths that the rook can take.** The rook can move in any direction, so it is important to consider all possible paths that it can take in order to find the minimum number of spells that need to be removed.
* **Incorrectly handling the case where the rook is blocked by two or more spells.** If the rook is blocked by two or more spells, it may not be possible to remove the minimum number of spells. In this case, the developer should return `-1`.
* **Not handling the case where there are no spells.** If there are no spells, the rook can simply move to the top row without removing any spells. In this case, the developer should return `0`.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use a `set` data structure to store the spells. This will help you to quickly and easily check if a spell has already been removed.
* Consider all possible paths that the rook can take. This can be done by using a backtracking algorithm.
* Handle the case where the rook is blocked by two or more spells by returning `-1`.
* Handle the case where there are no spells by returning `0`.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1066_F. Yet another 2D Walking

Pain points:
Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correctly specified, which can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
* **Incorrect data type:** The data type of the input values may not be correctly specified, which can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
* **Incorrect algorithm:** The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect, which can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
* **Incorrect implementation:** The implementation of the algorithm may contain bugs, which can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
* **Incorrect test cases:** The test cases used to verify the correctness of the program may be incorrect, which can lead to the program being incorrectly accepted.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to use the correct data types and algorithms to solve the problem. Finally, it is important to write unit tests to verify the correctness of the program.

Here are some specific examples of problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format specifies that the first line of the input contains one integer n, which is the number of key points. However, the input file may contain a different number of lines. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
* **Incorrect data type:** The input values are specified as integers. However, the input file may contain non-integer values. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
* **Incorrect algorithm:** The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not take into account the fact that Maksim cannot visit points of level i + 1 if he does not visit all the points of level i. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
* **Incorrect implementation:** The implementation of the algorithm may contain bugs. For example, the implementation may not correctly calculate the distance between two points. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
* **Incorrect test cases:** The test cases used to verify the correctness of the program may be incorrect. For example, the test cases may not test all of the possible input values. This can lead to the program being incorrectly accepted.

CODEFORCES 1089_J. JS Minification

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect parsing of reserved tokens.** The input may contain reserved tokens that are not valid according to the problem statement. For example, the token `++` is not a valid reserved token. The program should raise an error if it encounters an invalid reserved token.
* **Incorrect parsing of numbers.** The input may contain numbers that are not valid according to the problem statement. For example, the number `123.45` is not a valid number. The program should raise an error if it encounters an invalid number.
* **Incorrect parsing of words.** The input may contain words that are not valid according to the problem statement. For example, the word `123abc` is not a valid word. The program should raise an error if it encounters an invalid word.
* **Incorrect renaming of words.** The program should rename words in a systematic fashion using the algorithm described in the problem statement. For example, the words `foo` and `bar` should be renamed to `a` and `b`, respectively. The program should raise an error if it encounters a word that is not renamed correctly.
* **Incorrect minification of the source code.** The program should minify the source code by removing all unnecessary spaces. For example, the code `fun a(b) { var c = 1, d = 0, e; while (b > 0) { e = c; c = c + d; d = e; b--; } return c; }` should be minified to `fun a(b){var c=1,d=0,e;while(b>0){e=c;c=c+d;d=e;b--;}return c;}`. The program should raise an error if it does not minify the source code correctly.

**How to avoid these problems and bugs:**

* To avoid incorrect parsing of reserved tokens, the program should first check that each reserved token is valid. If a reserved token is invalid, the program should raise an error.
* To avoid incorrect parsing of numbers, the program should first check that each number is valid. If a number is invalid, the program should raise an error.
* To avoid incorrect parsing of words, the program should first check that each word is valid. If a word is invalid, the program should raise an error.
* To avoid incorrect renaming of words, the program should follow the algorithm described in the problem statement. If a word is not renamed correctly, the program should raise an error.
* To avoid incorrect minification of the source code, the program should remove all unnecessary spaces. If the source code is not minified correctly, the program should raise an error.

CODEFORCES 1137_F. Matches Are Not a Child's Play 

Pain points:
### Possible problems and bugs ###

* **Incorrect implementation of the burning algorithm.** The burning algorithm is a complex one, and it is easy to make mistakes when implementing it. For example, you might forget to update the priorities of the vertices after they burn out, or you might not correctly handle the case when two vertices have the same priority.
* **Incorrect handling of queries.** The queries can be of three types: "up", "when", and "compare". You need to make sure that you correctly handle each type of query. For example, for a "when" query, you need to find the step at which the vertex will burn out, and for a "compare" query, you need to determine which of the two vertices will burn out first.
* **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem requires you to use data structures to store the information about the tree and the queries. You need to make sure that you use the data structures correctly, and that they are able to handle the large number of vertices and queries.
* **Time complexity.** The burning algorithm is a recursive algorithm, and it has a time complexity of O(n^2). You need to make sure that your implementation of the algorithm does not have a worse time complexity.
* **Memory usage.** The burning algorithm can use a lot of memory, especially if the tree is large. You need to make sure that your implementation of the algorithm does not use too much memory.

### How to avoid these problems and bugs ###

* To avoid incorrect implementation of the burning algorithm, you should carefully read the problem statement and the algorithm description. You should also write unit tests to verify that your implementation is correct.
* To avoid incorrect handling of queries, you should carefully read the problem statement and the description of each type of query. You should also write unit tests to verify that your implementation is correct.
* To avoid incorrect use of data structures, you should carefully read the problem statement and the description of each data structure. You should also write unit tests to verify that your implementation is correct.
* To avoid a time complexity that is worse than O(n^2), you should use a more efficient algorithm for burning the tree. For example, you could use a breadth-first search algorithm.
* To avoid a memory usage that is too high, you should use data structures that are designed for sparse graphs. For example, you could use an adjacency list.
Test inputs:
### Incorrect implementation of the burning algorithm ###

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, q;
  cin >> n >> q;

  vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    adj[u - 1].push_back(v - 1);
    adj[v - 1].push_back(u - 1);
  }

  // IMPLEMENT THE BURNING ALGORITHM HERE

  return 0;
}
```

This implementation of the burning algorithm is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case when two vertices have the same priority. For example, if two vertices have the same priority and they are both adjacent to a third vertex, then the burning algorithm will incorrectly determine that the third vertex will burn out first.

### Incorrect handling of queries ###

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, q;
  cin >> n >> q;

  vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    adj[u - 1].push_back(v - 1);
    adj[v - 1].push_back(u - 1);
  }

  // IMPLEMENT THE QUERY HANDLING HERE

  return 0;
}
```

This implementation of the query handling is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case when a query asks for the step at which a vertex will burn out, but the vertex has already burned out. For example, if a query asks for the step at which vertex 1 will burn out, but vertex 1 has already burned out, then the implementation will incorrectly return 1.

### Incorrect use of data structures ###

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, q;
  cin >> n >> q;

  vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    adj[u - 1].push_back(v - 1);
    adj[v - 1].push_back(u - 1);
  }

  // IMPLEMENT THE DATA STRUCTURES HERE

  return 0;
}
```

This implementation of the data structures is incorrect because it does not correctly store the information about the tree. For example, if the tree has a cycle, then the implementation will incorrectly store the information about the cycle. This can lead to incorrect results when handling queries.

### Time complexity ###

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, q;
  cin >> n >> q;

  vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    adj[u - 1].push_back(v - 1);
    adj[v - 1].push_back(u - 1);
  }

  // IMPLEMENT THE BURNING ALGORITHM HERE

  return 0;
}
```

This implementation of the burning algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2). This is because the algorithm iterates over all of the vertices in the tree, and for each vertex, it iterates over all of the adjacent vertices. This results in a total time complexity of O(n^2).

### Memory usage ###

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, q;
  cin >> n >> q;

  vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    adj[u - 1].push_back(v - 1);

Title:
CODEFORCES 1178_E. Archaeology

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the `substr()` function.** The `substr()` function returns a substring of a string, starting at the specified index and continuing for the specified number of characters. If the specified index is greater than the length of the string, an empty string is returned. For example, the following code would return the empty string:

```
>>> s = "abc"
>>> substr(s, 4, 1)
''
```

To avoid this problem, make sure that the specified index is less than the length of the string.

2. **Incorrect use of the `len()` function.** The `len()` function returns the length of a string. If the string is empty, the `len()` function returns 0. For example, the following code would return 0:

```
>>> s = ''
>>> len(s)
0
```

To avoid this problem, make sure that the string is not empty before using the `len()` function.

3. **Incorrect use of the `ord()` function.** The `ord()` function returns the ASCII code of a character. For example, the following code would return the ASCII code for the letter `a`:

```
>>> ord('a')
97
```

To avoid this problem, make sure that the character you are passing to the `ord()` function is a valid ASCII character.

4. **Incorrect use of the `chr()` function.** The `chr()` function returns the character with the specified ASCII code. For example, the following code would return the letter `a`:

```
>>> chr(97)
'a'
```

To avoid this problem, make sure that the ASCII code you are passing to the `chr()` function is valid.

5. **Incorrect use of the `in` operator.** The `in` operator checks if a value is contained in a sequence. For example, the following code would return True:

```
>>> 'a' in 'abc'
True
```

To avoid this problem, make sure that the value you are checking for is actually contained in the sequence.

6. **Incorrect use of the `for` loop.** The `for` loop iterates over a sequence of values. For example, the following code would print the letters in the string `'abc'`:

```
>>> for letter in 'abc':
...     print(letter)
...
a
b
c
```

To avoid this problem, make sure that the sequence you are iterating over is valid.
Test inputs:
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 1196_D2. RGB Substring (hard version)

Pain points:

 In this problem, the most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving the problem are:

1. **Incorrectly counting the number of characters that need to be changed.** This is a common mistake that can be made when the developer is not careful about the order in which the characters are changed. For example, if the string is "RGBRGBRGB" and the substring is "RGB", then the developer might incorrectly count the number of characters that need to be changed as 3, when it is actually only 1.
2. **Using an incorrect algorithm to find the substring.** There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to find a substring in a string. The developer should choose an algorithm that is appropriate for the problem and that is efficient. For example, the brute-force algorithm is not efficient for this problem, because it would require the developer to check every possible substring.
3. **Not handling special cases correctly.** There are a number of special cases that the developer should be aware of when solving this problem. For example, if the string is empty, then the substring is also empty and no characters need to be changed.
4. **Using incorrect data types.** The developer should use the correct data types to store the input and output of the problem. For example, if the input is a string, then the developer should use a string data type to store it.
5. **Not testing the code thoroughly.** The developer should test the code thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly. This includes testing the code with different input values and different substring lengths.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may not contain two integers n and k, or the integers may not be in the correct range.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may not contain two lines, or the first line may not be "YES" or "NO", or the second line may not contain a string of length n.
3. **Incorrect solution**. The solution may not find a string that satisfies the given constraints. For example, the solution may find a string that contains fewer than k distinct characters, or a string that does not sort the characters in the non-decreasing order.
4. **Memory limit exceeded**. The solution may use too much memory. This can happen if the solution stores a large amount of data, or if the solution uses a recursive algorithm with a large stack depth.
5. **Time limit exceeded**. The solution may take too long to run. This can happen if the solution uses a computationally expensive algorithm, or if the solution makes repeated calls to a slow function.
6. **Incorrect data**. The data may be incorrect. This can happen if the data is corrupted, or if the data is not generated correctly.
7. **Other bugs**. There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the solution may not handle all possible cases correctly, or the solution may not be robust to errors.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1237_B. Balanced Tunnel

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or the input may not have the correct number of lines.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the output may contain a non-integer number, or the output may not have the correct number of lines.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the solution is incorrect. For example, the solution may not correctly identify the cars that must be fined, or the solution may not correctly calculate the number of cars that must be fined.
4. **Memory leak**. The solution may not release memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
5. **Time complexity**. The solution may have a time complexity that is too high. This can make the solution run slowly, especially for large inputs.
6. **Space complexity**. The solution may have a space complexity that is too high. This can make the solution use too much memory, especially for large inputs.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement. It is also important to test the solution thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and efficient.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1255_A. Changing Volume

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The problem states that the volume can be arbitrarily large, but can never be negative. So we need to use a signed integer to store the volume. If we use an unsigned integer, it will overflow when the volume is too large.
2. **Off-by-one error.** The problem states that Bob cannot press the button if it causes the volume to be lower than 0. So we need to check if the volume will be negative after pressing a button.
3. **Incorrect algorithm.** The problem asks us to find the minimum number of presses to change the TV volume from a to b. One possible solution is to first find the absolute difference between a and b, then divide it by the size of each button press. However, this solution is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that Bob cannot press a button if it causes the volume to be lower than 0.
4. **Incorrect implementation.** The problem states that there are six buttons on the remote control. So we need to make sure that our program supports all six buttons.
5. **Incorrect test cases.** We need to make sure that our program passes all the test cases in the problem statement.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1278_F. Cards

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The most common mistake when solving this problem is to implement the algorithm incorrectly. This can lead to incorrect results or even a runtime error.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the algorithm before implementing it. It is also helpful to test the algorithm on a few small examples to make sure that it is working correctly.

**2. Using the wrong modulo**

Another common mistake is to use the wrong modulo when computing the expected value of x^k. This can lead to incorrect results.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct modulo in all of your calculations. The modulo in this problem is 998244353.

**3. Using an incorrect inverse**

When computing the expected value of x^k, it is necessary to use an inverse of the modulo. This is because the expected value of x^k is a fraction, and we need to convert it to a decimal number by multiplying it by the inverse of the modulo.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct inverse of the modulo. The inverse of 998244353 is 499122178.

**4. Using an incorrect factorization**

When computing the expected value of x^k, it is necessary to factor the modulo. This is because the expected value of x^k is a fraction, and we need to convert it to a decimal number by multiplying it by the inverse of the modulo.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct factorization of the modulo. The modulo in this problem is 998244353, and it can be factored as 3^2 * 1337.

**5. Using an incorrect exponentiation algorithm**

When computing the expected value of x^k, it is necessary to use an exponentiation algorithm. This is because the expected value of x^k is a large number, and we need to compute it quickly.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to make sure that you are using an efficient exponentiation algorithm. The most efficient exponentiation algorithm for this problem is the binary exponentiation algorithm.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1383_B. GameGame

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of bitwise operators**. The bitwise XOR operator (^) is often misused as an ordinary addition operator. This can lead to incorrect results, as the XOR operator does not perform addition. For example, the expression `a ^ b` does not evaluate to `a + b`, but rather to `a ⊕ b`.
2. **Incorrect handling of negative numbers**. The bitwise XOR operator does not work correctly on negative numbers. For example, the expression `a ^ b` does not evaluate to `a + b`, but rather to `a ⊕ b`. This can lead to incorrect results, as the XOR operator does not perform addition.
3. **Incorrect handling of overflow**. The bitwise XOR operator can overflow, resulting in incorrect results. For example, the expression `a ^ b` does not evaluate to `a + b`, but rather to `a ⊕ b`. This can lead to incorrect results, as the XOR operator does not perform addition.
4. **Incorrect handling of zero**. The bitwise XOR operator does not work correctly on zero. For example, the expression `a ^ b` does not evaluate to `a + b`, but rather to `a ⊕ b`. This can lead to incorrect results, as the XOR operator does not perform addition.
5. **Incorrect handling of empty arrays**. The bitwise XOR operator does not work correctly on empty arrays. For example, the expression `a ^ b` does not evaluate to `a + b`, but rather to `a ⊕ b`. This can lead to incorrect results, as the XOR operator does not perform addition.
6. **Incorrect handling of duplicate elements**. The bitwise XOR operator does not work correctly on duplicate elements. For example, the expression `a ^ b` does not evaluate to `a + b`, but rather to `a ⊕ b`. This can lead to incorrect results, as the XOR operator does not perform addition.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1404_B. Tree Tag

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect implementation of BFS

A common mistake is to implement BFS incorrectly. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
def bfs(graph, start):
  visited = set()
  queue = [start]
  while queue:
    vertex = queue.pop(0)
    visited.add(vertex)
    for neighbor in graph[vertex]:
      if neighbor not in visited:
        queue.append(neighbor)

```

The problem with this code is that it does not check if the current vertex is already in the visited set before adding it to the queue. This can lead to an infinite loop if the graph contains a cycle.

To fix this, we can add the following check to the `bfs()` function:

```
def bfs(graph, start):
  visited = set()
  queue = [start]
  while queue:
    vertex = queue.pop(0)
    if vertex not in visited:
      visited.add(vertex)
      for neighbor in graph[vertex]:
        queue.append(neighbor)

```

### 2. Using the wrong data structure

Another common mistake is to use the wrong data structure to represent the graph. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
def bfs(graph, start):
  visited = set()
  queue = [start]
  while queue:
    vertex = queue.pop(0)
    visited.add(vertex)
    for neighbor in vertex.neighbors:
      if neighbor not in visited:
        queue.append(neighbor)

```

The problem with this code is that it uses a list to represent the graph. This is not a good choice because lists are not efficient for storing graphs with a large number of vertices. A better choice would be to use a data structure such as a [graph](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict) or a [networkx](https://networkx.org/) graph.

### 3. Not handling edge cases

Another common mistake is to not handle edge cases. For example, the following code would not work correctly if the graph is empty:

```
def bfs(graph, start):
  visited = set()
  queue = [start]
  while queue:
    vertex = queue.pop(0)
    visited.add(vertex)
    for neighbor in graph[vertex]:
      if neighbor not in visited:
        queue.append(neighbor)

```

To fix this, we can add the following check to the `bfs()` function:

```
def bfs(graph, start):
  if not graph:
    return

  visited = set()
  queue = [start]
  while queue:
    vertex = queue.pop(0)
    visited.add(vertex)
    for neighbor in graph[vertex]:
      if neighbor not in visited:
        queue.append(neighbor)

```

### 4. Using incorrect or incomplete logic

Another common mistake is to use incorrect or incomplete logic in your algorithm. For example, the following code would not work correctly if the graph contains a cycle:

```
def bfs(graph, start):
  visited = set()
  queue = [start]
  while queue:
    vertex = queue.pop(0)
    visited.add(vertex)
    for neighbor in graph[vertex]:
      if neighbor not in visited:
        queue.append(neighbor)

  return visited

```

The problem with this code is that it does not check if the current vertex is already in the visited set before adding it to the queue. This can lead to an infinite loop if the graph contains a cycle.

To fix this, we can add the following check to the `bfs()` function:

```
def bfs(graph, start):
  if start in visited:
    return visited

  visited.add(start)
  queue = [start]
  while queue:
    vertex = queue.pop(0)
    for neighbor in graph[vertex]:
      if neighbor not in visited:
        queue.append(neighbor)

  return visited

```

### 5. Not using the most efficient algorithm

Finally, another common mistake is to not use the most efficient algorithm. For example, the following code would not be very efficient for large graphs:

```

Title:
CODEFORCES 1425_H. Huge Boxes of Animal Toys

Pain points:
**Possible Problems and Bugs:**

1. **Incorrect input format:** The input format should be a single integer `T` (number of test cases) followed by `T` lines, each line containing four space-separated integers `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` (number of toys in the first, second, third, and fourth boxes, respectively). If the input format is incorrect, the program should raise an error.
2. **Incorrect output format:** The output should be four space-separated strings, each string representing the possibility that the first, second, third, and fourth box can be the special box from left to right. If the output format is incorrect, the program should raise an error.
3. **Incorrect logic:** The program should correctly determine which boxes can be the special box after Chaneka found her super toy. If the logic is incorrect, the program may output incorrect results.
4. **Memory leak:** The program should not leak memory. If the program leaks memory, it may eventually crash.
5. **Time complexity:** The program should run in time `O(T)`, where `T` is the number of test cases. If the program's time complexity is higher than `O(T)`, it may not be able to solve all test cases in time.
6. **Space complexity:** The program should use space `O(T)`, where `T` is the number of test cases. If the program's space complexity is higher than `O(T)`, it may not be able to solve all test cases in memory.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1447_E. Xor Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the XOR operation.** The XOR operation is a binary operation that takes two bits as operands and returns a third bit that is the result of the exclusive-or of the two operands. In other words, the XOR of two bits is 1 if and only if exactly one of the bits is 1. For example, the XOR of 0 and 1 is 1, and the XOR of 1 and 1 is 0.
2. **Using the wrong data type to store the numbers in the sequence.** The numbers in the sequence can be very large, so it is important to use a data type that can store them without overflowing. For example, if the numbers are all positive and less than 2^31, you can use the `int` data type. However, if the numbers can be negative or greater than 2^31, you will need to use a larger data type, such as `long long`.
3. **Not handling the case where the sequence is empty.** The problem statement states that the sequence must have at least 2 elements, so you need to make sure to handle the case where the sequence is empty. One way to do this is to check if the length of the sequence is 0 before you start processing it.
4. **Not handling the case where the sequence contains duplicate elements.** The problem statement does not explicitly state that the sequence cannot contain duplicate elements, but it is implied by the fact that the XOR of two equal numbers is always 0. If the sequence contains duplicate elements, you will need to handle this case separately.
5. **Not handling the case where the sequence is already good.** The problem statement states that you can remove some number of elements from the sequence to make it good, but it does not specify what happens if the sequence is already good. In this case, you should output 0.
6. **Not using the most efficient algorithm.** The problem can be solved in O(n) time using a simple greedy algorithm. However, there are more efficient algorithms that can be used to solve the problem in O(n log n) time.
7. **Making a mistake in your implementation.** This is the most common cause of bugs in any program. It is important to carefully check your code for errors before submitting it.

CODEFORCES 1472_E. Correct Placement

Pain points:
 1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format should be exactly as specified in the problem statement. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a bug in the algorithm, or using an incorrect data structure. If the algorithm is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem and will produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect output format.** The output format should be exactly as specified in the problem statement. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly output the solution and will produce incorrect output.
4. **Runtime errors.** The program may run into runtime errors, such as a segmentation fault or a floating point exception. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a bug in the code, or using an incorrect data type. If the program runs into a runtime error, it will not be able to finish running and will produce incorrect output.
5. **Memory errors.** The program may run out of memory while running. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a bug in the code, or using an incorrect data structure. If the program runs out of memory, it will not be able to finish running and will produce incorrect output.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the problem. It is also important to carefully design and implement the algorithm, and to test the program thoroughly before submitting it.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1498_F. Christmas Game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the game rules.** The game rules are quite complex, so it is easy to make a mistake when implementing them. For example, you might forget to check that the player is allowed to make the move they are trying to make, or you might not correctly calculate the number of presents that the player can move.
2. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem requires you to maintain a tree of presents. If you use the wrong data structure, it may be inefficient or even impossible to solve the problem. For example, if you use a linked list to represent the tree, it will be very slow to find the k-th ancestor of a node.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement specifies a number of constraints on the input data. For example, the number of nodes in the tree must be at least 3 and at most 10^5, and the value of k must be at least 1 and at most 20. If you do not handle these edge cases correctly, your solution may not be correct.
4. **Incorrect debugging.** When you are debugging your solution, it is important to be able to identify the source of the error. This can be difficult if you do not have a good understanding of the problem and the solution. One way to debug your solution is to print out the values of key variables at each step of the execution. This can help you to identify where the error is occurring.
5. **Time complexity and space complexity.** It is important to consider the time complexity and space complexity of your solution. The time complexity of your solution should be polynomial in the size of the input data. The space complexity of your solution should be linear in the size of the input data.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand the rules of the game.
* Use the correct data structures to represent the tree of presents.
* Handle edge cases correctly.
* Use a debugger to help you identify the source of errors.
* Consider the time complexity and space complexity of your solution.

3. **Off-by-one errors**. The solution may incorrectly count the number of double profiles, either by counting too many or too few.
4. **Memory leaks**. The solution may not properly free memory that it allocates, which can lead to a memory leak.
5. **Race conditions**. The solution may not be thread-safe, which can lead to incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.
6. **Incorrect output format**. The solution may not print the output in the correct format, such as by using the wrong data type or by not printing the output on a single line.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the solution thoroughly with a variety of input data, including invalid data. Finally, it is important to use a memory-safe programming language and to follow good coding practices to avoid memory leaks and race conditions.

CODEFORCES 176_A. Trading Business

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly and in the correct order. For example, if you were to read the input as `n,m,k a,b,c` instead of `n,m,k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, you would get the wrong answer.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer. Make sure that you are only printing the integer and nothing else. For example, if you were to print `10\n`, you would get the wrong answer.

**3. Not considering all of the constraints**

This problem has a number of constraints, such as the number of planets, the number of item types, and the capacity of Qwerty's ship hold. It is important to make sure that you are considering all of these constraints when you are solving the problem. For example, if you were to try to buy more items than Qwerty's ship hold can hold, you would get the wrong answer.

**4. Using incorrect data structures**

The data structures that you use to solve this problem can have a big impact on the performance of your solution. For example, if you were to use a list to store the prices of the items, your solution would be much slower than if you were to use a dictionary.

**5. Using inefficient algorithms**

There are a number of different algorithms that you could use to solve this problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. For example, a greedy algorithm would be much faster than a brute force algorithm.

**6. Making a mistake in your implementation**

Even the smallest mistake in your implementation can have a big impact on the correctness of your solution. For example, if you were to forget to add a `break` statement in your loop, your solution would not work correctly.

**7. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed. For example, you could test your code on a few different input sets to make sure that it is working correctly.

CODEFORCES 291_E. Tree-String Problem

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrectly implementing the tree traversal algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. Make sure that you are correctly following the algorithm and that you are not missing any edges or vertices.
2. **Incorrectly handling the case where the tree is not a binary tree.** The problem statement specifies that the tree must be a binary tree, but it is possible that the input data will not conform to this requirement. Make sure that you check for this case and handle it appropriately.
3. **Incorrectly handling the case where the input data is invalid.** The input data may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or non-alphabetic characters. Make sure that you check for this case and handle it appropriately.
4. **Incorrectly computing the number of pairs of positions that define the given string.** This is the most important part of the problem, and it is easy to make mistakes here. Make sure that you are correctly counting the number of pairs of positions that satisfy the given criteria.
5. **Incorrectly formatting your output.** The problem statement specifies that the output must be a single integer. Make sure that you are correctly formatting your output and that it meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly implementing the tree traversal algorithm.** One common mistake is to incorrectly implement the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. For example, you might forget to visit the children of a vertex in the correct order. This would result in incorrect results.
* **Incorrectly handling the case where the tree is not a binary tree.** Another common mistake is to incorrectly handle the case where the tree is not a binary tree. For example, you might try to use a DFS algorithm to traverse the tree, but this would not work correctly for non-binary trees.
* **Incorrectly handling the case where the input data is invalid.** The input data may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or non-alphabetic characters. If you do not handle these cases correctly, your program may crash or produce incorrect results.
* **Incorrectly computing the number of pairs of positions that define the given string.** This is the most important part of the problem, and it is easy to make mistakes here. For example, you might forget to account for the fact that the same pair of positions can define the given string multiple times. This would result in incorrect results.
* **Incorrectly formatting your output.** The problem statement specifies that the output must be a single integer. If you do not correctly format your output, your program may not be accepted by the judge.

 **1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake and get an incorrect result. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not strictly defined, but there are a few common mistakes that people make. For example, you might forget to add a newline character at the end of each line, or you might print the output in the wrong order.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common problem in programming, and they can be especially tricky to find. For example, if you forget to increment a variable by one, the program will produce the wrong result.

**4. Logical errors**

Logical errors are another common problem in programming. These are errors that occur when the program does not do what you expect it to do. For example, you might write a program to calculate the sum of a series of numbers, but the program might actually calculate the product of the numbers.

**5. Memory errors**

Memory errors can occur when a program allocates too much or too little memory. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect results.

**6. Race conditions**

Race conditions can occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or to crash.

**7. Deadlocks**

Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely.

**8. Security vulnerabilities**

Security vulnerabilities can occur when a program does not properly protect its data. This can allow attackers to access sensitive data or to take control of the program.

**9. Performance problems**

Performance problems can occur when a program is not written efficiently. This can cause the program to run slowly or to use too much memory.

**10. Scalability problems**

Scalability problems can occur when a program cannot handle a large amount of data or a large number of users. This can cause the program to slow down or to crash.

CODEFORCES 386_C. Diverse Substrings

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of substrings.** When working with substrings, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct indices. For example, in the code below, the substring `s[i:j]` includes the character at index `j`, which is not what we want.

```python
def get_substring_diversity(s, i, j):
  """Gets the diversity of the substring from index `i` to index `j`.

  Args:
    s: The string to get the substring from.
    i: The start index of the substring.
    j: The end index of the substring.

  Returns:
    The diversity of the substring.
  """

  # Make sure that `i` is less than `j`.

  if i > j:
    raise ValueError("i must be less than j")

  # Get the set of characters in the substring.

  chars = set(s[i:j])

  # Return the number of characters in the set.

  return len(chars)
```

2. **Incorrect use of indices.** When working with indices, it is important to make sure that they are valid. For example, in the code below, the index `i` is out of bounds of the string `s`.

```python
def get_substring_diversity(s, i, j):
  """Gets the diversity of the substring from index `i` to index `j`.

  Args:
    s: The string to get the substring from.
    i: The start index of the substring.
    j: The end index of the substring.

  Returns:
    The diversity of the substring.
  """

  # Make sure that `i` is less than `j`.

  if i > j:
    raise ValueError("i must be less than j")

  # Get the set of characters in the substring.

  chars = set(s[i:j])

  # Return the number of characters in the set.

  return len(chars)

# Get the diversity of the substring from index 0 to index 10.

diversity = get_substring_diversity(s, 0, 10)
```

3. **Incorrect use of data structures.** When working with data structures, it is important to make sure that you are using them correctly. For example, in the code below, the `Counter` data structure is used to store the number of occurrences of each character in the string. However, the `Counter` data structure does not store the order of the characters, so the code below will not work correctly.

```python
def get_substring_diversity(s):
  """Gets the diversity of the string `s`.

  Args:
    s: The string to get the diversity of.

  Returns:
    The diversity of the string.
  """

  # Get the number of occurrences of each character in the string.

  counts = collections.Counter(s)

  # Return the number of unique characters in the string.

  return len(counts)
```

4. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** When working with algorithms, it is important to make sure that you are using them correctly. For example, in the code below, the `bisect` algorithm is used to find the index of the first occurrence of the character `c` in the string `s`. However, the `bisect` algorithm only works with sorted lists, so the code below will not work correctly if the string `s` is not sorted.

```python
def get_substring_diversity(s, c):
  """Gets the diversity of the string `s`.

  Args:
    s: The string to get the diversity of.
    c: The character to find the index of.

  Returns:
    The index of the first occurrence of the character `c` in the string `s`.
  """

  # Find the index of the first occurrence of the character `c` in the string `s`.

  index = bisect.bisect_left(s, c)

  # Return the index of the first occurrence of the character `c` in the string `s`.

  return index
```

5. **Incorrect use of logic.** When working with logic, it is important to make sure
Test inputs:
**Incorrect use of logic.** When working with logic, it is important to make sure that you are using it correctly. For example, in the code below, the following logic is incorrect:

```python
if x < y:
  print("x is less than y")
else:
  print("x is not less than y")
```

This logic is incorrect because it does not consider the case where x and y are equal. A correct version of this logic would be:

```python
if x < y:
  print("x is less than y")
elif x == y:
  print("x and y are equal")
else:
  print("x is not less than y")
```

Here are some program inputs that will validate whether an implementation meets each of the requirements listed above:

```
s = "abca"

# This code will fail because it uses an index that is out of bounds of the string.

print(get_substring_diversity(s, 10, 11))
```

3. **Incorrect use of data structures.**

```
s = "abca"

# This code will fail because it uses the `Counter` data structure incorrectly.

counts = collections.Counter(s)
print(len(counts))
```

4. **Incorrect use of algorithms.**

```
s = "abca"

# This code will fail because it uses the `bisect` algorithm incorrectly.

index = bisect.bisect_left(s, "b")
print(index)
```

5. **Incorrect use of logic.**

```

CODEFORCES 407_B. Long Path

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correct. For example, the input may contain a string instead of an integer.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correct. For example, the output may contain a float instead of an integer.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The developer may make a mistake in the calculation. For example, the developer may forget to carry over a carry when adding two numbers.
4. **Memory leak**. The developer may not release memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
5. **Race condition**. The developer may not synchronize access to shared data between multiple threads. This can lead to a race condition, which can cause the program to produce incorrect results or even crash.
6. **Deadlock**. The developer may create a situation where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, which can prevent any of the threads from making progress. This is called a deadlock, and it can also cause the program to crash.
7. **Security vulnerability**. The developer may make a mistake that allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the program or its data. For example, the developer may not properly sanitize user input, which can allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the program.
8. **Performance bottleneck**. The developer may write inefficient code that causes the program to run slowly. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as using inefficient algorithms, using too much memory, or making too many calls to the operating system.
9. **Unmaintainable code**. The developer may write code that is difficult to understand and maintain. This can make it difficult to fix bugs or add new features to the program.
10. **Undocumented code**. The developer may not document the code properly. This can make it difficult for other developers to understand how the code works.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully review their code and test it thoroughly before releasing it to production. They should also use a variety of tools and techniques to help them find and fix bugs.

CODEFORCES 434_C. Tachibana Kanade's Tofu

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect base conversion**

When converting from an integer to a string in a different base, it is important to make sure that the conversion is done correctly. For example, the following code will incorrectly convert the integer 10 to a binary string:

```python
bin(10)
```

This will return the string `'0b1010'`, which is not a valid binary string. The correct way to convert an integer to a binary string is to use the `bin()` function with the `prefix` argument set to `False`:

```python
bin(10, False)
```

This will return the string `'1010'`, which is a valid binary string.

**2. Incorrect modulo arithmetic**

When performing modulo arithmetic, it is important to make sure that the modulus is a positive integer. For example, the following code will incorrectly calculate the remainder of 10 divided by 5:

```python
10 % 5
```

This will return the value `-1`, which is not a valid remainder. The correct way to calculate the remainder of 10 divided by 5 is to use the `%` operator with the modulus explicitly specified:

```python
10 % 5
```

This will return the value `0`, which is the correct remainder.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a programmer forgets to account for the first or last element in a list or array. For example, the following code will incorrectly calculate the sum of the first 10 integers:

```python
sum(range(1, 11))
```

This will return the value `55`, which is not the correct sum of the first 10 integers (which is 55). The correct way to calculate the sum of the first 10 integers is to use the `range()` function with the `stop` argument set to `11`:

```python
sum(range(1, 11))
```

This will return the value `55`, which is the correct sum.

**4. Indexing errors**

Indexing errors occur when a programmer tries to access an element of an array or list that does not exist. For example, the following code will incorrectly print the first element of the empty list `[]`:

```python
print(list[0])
```

This will cause a `IndexError` exception to be raised. The correct way to print the first element of the list `[]` is to use the `len()` function to check if the list is empty, and then use the `[]` operator to access the first element:

```python
if len(list) > 0:
    print(list[0])
```

This will only print the first element of the list if the list is not empty.

**5. Logic errors**

Logic errors occur when a programmer makes a mistake in the logical flow of their code. For example, the following code will incorrectly print the first element of the list `['a', 'b', 'c']`:

```python
for element in list:
    if element == 'a':
        print(element)
```

This will print the element `'b'`, which is not the first element of the list. The correct way to print the first element of the list is to use the `index()` function to find the index of the first element, and then use the `[]` operator to access that element:

```python
print(list[list.index('a')])
```

This will print the element `'a'`, which is the first element of the list.

Title:
CODEFORCES 552_D. Vanya and Triangles

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for coordinates.** The coordinates of the points are given as integers, but they can be negative. If you use an integer data type for the coordinates, you may get an overflow error when computing the area of a triangle.
2. **Not taking into account the orientation of the triangles.** When you compute the area of a triangle, you need to take into account the orientation of the triangle. A triangle is oriented counterclockwise if the product of the x-coordinates of the vertices is negative. A triangle is oriented clockwise if the product of the x-coordinates of the vertices is positive.
3. **Counting triangles that are not distinct.** When you count the number of triangles, you need to make sure that you are not counting triangles that are not distinct. A triangle is not distinct if it is congruent to another triangle. Two triangles are congruent if they have the same shape and size.
4. **Using a brute-force approach.** The brute-force approach to solving this problem is to enumerate all possible combinations of three points and check if they form a triangle. This approach is very inefficient, as it can take a long time to run for large values of n.
5. **Using a divide-and-conquer approach.** A divide-and-conquer approach can be used to solve this problem more efficiently. The idea is to divide the set of points into two sets and then recursively compute the number of triangles in each set. The number of triangles in the original set is equal to the sum of the number of triangles in the two sets.
6. **Using a dynamic programming approach.** A dynamic programming approach can also be used to solve this problem efficiently. The idea is to create a table that stores the number of triangles that can be formed from a given set of points. The number of triangles in the original set can then be computed by summing the values in the table.

Title:
CODEFORCES 622_F. The Sum of the k-th Powers

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect modulo operator**

The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. For example, 10 % 3 = 1. However, if you use the modulo operator with a negative number, the result will be incorrect. For example, -10 % 3 = -1, which is not the remainder of the division.

To avoid this problem, you can use the absolute value of the number before using the modulo operator. For example, (-10) % 3 = 1.

**2. Using incorrect factorial formula**

The factorial of a number n is the product of all the numbers from 1 to n. For example, 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120. However, if you use the factorial formula with a large number, the result will be incorrect. For example, 100! is too large to be represented by a 64-bit integer.

To avoid this problem, you can use the Stirling approximation, which is a more accurate formula for factorials of large numbers.

**3. Using incorrect summation formula**

The summation formula for the k-th powers of the first n natural numbers is given by:

```
S(n, k) = (n + 1) * (n + 2) * ... * (n + k) / k!
```

However, if you use this formula with a large value of n, the result will be incorrect. For example, S(100, 100) is too large to be represented by a 64-bit integer.

To avoid this problem, you can use the following approximation:

```
S(n, k) ≈ (n^k + n^(k - 1) + ... + n + 1) / k
```

**4. Using incorrect modulus**

The modulus of a number is the remainder of the division by a given number. For example, the modulus of 100 by 3 is 1. However, if you use the modulus operator with a large number, the result will be incorrect. For example, the modulus of 1000000000 by 3 is 0, which is not the correct answer.

To avoid this problem, you can use the following algorithm:

```
def mod(a, b):
    while a >= b:
        a -= b
    return a
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 644_B. Processing Queries

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the priority queue**

The priority queue is a data structure that stores elements in a sorted order. This means that the element with the highest priority is always at the front of the queue. When a new element is added to the queue, it is inserted in the correct position so that the queue remains sorted.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing a priority queue is to use the wrong data type for the elements. For example, if the elements are integers, then the priority queue should be implemented using a min-heap. This is because a min-heap is a binary tree in which the value of each node is less than or equal to the value of its children. This ensures that the element with the highest priority is always at the root of the tree.

If the elements are strings, then the priority queue should be implemented using a max-heap. This is because a max-heap is a binary tree in which the value of each node is greater than or equal to the value of its children. This ensures that the element with the highest priority is always at the root of the tree.

**2. Using the wrong data structure**

Another common mistake that developers make when solving this problem is to use the wrong data structure. For example, if the queries are arriving in a random order, then it is not possible to use a priority queue to solve the problem. This is because a priority queue only works when the elements are added in a sorted order.

In this case, it is better to use a queue to store the queries. A queue is a data structure that stores elements in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order. This means that the element that was added to the queue first is the first element that is removed from the queue.

**3. Not handling all of the edge cases**

When solving this problem, it is important to handle all of the edge cases. For example, what happens if the server is busy processing a query when a new query arrives? What happens if the queue is full when a new query arrives?

It is important to think about these edge cases and to make sure that your code handles them correctly.

**4. Using inefficient algorithms**

Another common mistake that developers make when solving this problem is to use inefficient algorithms. For example, one inefficient algorithm would be to sort the queries by their arrival time and then to process the queries in order. This algorithm would work, but it would be very inefficient.

A more efficient algorithm would be to use a priority queue to store the queries. This would allow the server to process the queries in the order of their priorities.

**5. Not using the right data types**

Finally, it is important to use the right data types when solving this problem. For example, if the queries are arriving in a random order, then it is important to use a data type that can store negative numbers. This is because the server may need to process a query that arrived before another query.

If you are not sure what data types to use, then it is always best to err on the side of caution and to use a data type that can store all of the possible values.

CODEFORCES 671_B. Robin Hood

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable initialization**. For example, initializing `min_wealth` and `max_wealth` to `0` instead of `INT_MAX` and `INT_MIN` respectively. This would lead to incorrect results if the input contains values greater than or less than `0`.
2. **Incorrect use of `cin` and `cout`**. For example, using `cin >> n >> k` instead of `cin.tie(NULL); ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin >> n >> k`. This would lead to incorrect results if the input contains multiple lines of data.
3. **Incorrect use of `sort`**. For example, using `sort(arr, arr + n)` instead of `sort(arr, arr + n, greater<int>())`. This would lead to incorrect results if the input contains negative values.
4. **Incorrect use of `min` and `max`**. For example, using `min(a, b)` instead of `min(a, b) - 1`. This would lead to incorrect results if the input contains values equal to `0`.
5. **Incorrect use of `&` and `*`.** For example, using `&min_wealth` instead of `min_wealth` in the following code:

```
min_wealth = arr[0];
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    min_wealth = min(&min_wealth, arr[i]);
}
```

This would lead to incorrect results if the input contains duplicate values.

6. **Incorrect use of pointers.** For example, using `*ptr` instead of `ptr->val`. This would lead to incorrect results if the input contains structures or objects.
7. **Incorrect use of arrays.** For example, accessing an array element out of bounds. This would lead to a segmentation fault.
8. **Incorrect use of functions.** For example, calling a function with the wrong number of arguments. This would lead to a compilation error.
9. **Incorrect use of data structures.** For example, using a linked list instead of an array. This would lead to incorrect results if the input contains a large number of elements.
10. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** For example, using a brute-force algorithm to solve a problem that can be solved more efficiently using a more specialized algorithm. This would lead to incorrect results or a waste of time.
Test inputs:

    }

    sort(arr, arr + n, greater<int>());

    cout << arr[0] - arr[n - 1] << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Incorrect variable initialization:**

```
int min_wealth = 0, max_wealth = 0;
```

This would lead to incorrect results if the input contains values greater than or less than `0`.

**Incorrect use of `cin` and `cout`:**

```
cin >> n >> k;
cout << arr[0] - arr[n - 1] << endl;
```

This would lead to incorrect results if the input contains multiple lines of data.

**Incorrect use of `sort`:**

```
sort(arr, arr + n);
```

This would lead to incorrect results if the input contains negative values.

**Incorrect use of `min` and `max`:**

```
min_wealth = min(a, b);
```

This would lead to incorrect results if the input contains values equal to `0`.

**Incorrect use of `&` and `*`:**

```
min_wealth = arr[0];
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    min_wealth = min(&min_wealth, arr[i]);
}
```

This would lead to incorrect results if the input contains duplicate values.

**Incorrect use of pointers:**

```

This would lead to incorrect results if the input contains structures or objects.

**Incorrect use of arrays:**

```

Possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect implementation of the DFS algorithm.** The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that visits all nodes in a tree or graph. It is often used to find the shortest path between two nodes or to find all connected components in a graph. When implementing the DFS algorithm, it is important to be careful to avoid infinite recursion or stack overflow errors.
* **Incorrect implementation of the priority queue.** A priority queue is a data structure that stores elements in order of their priority. The highest priority element is always at the front of the queue. When implementing a priority queue, it is important to be careful to avoid duplicate elements and to ensure that the elements are always sorted in order of their priority.
* **Incorrect implementation of the union-find data structure.** The union-find data structure is a data structure that maintains a set of disjoint sets. It is often used to find connected components in a graph or to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph. When implementing the union-find data structure, it is important to be careful to avoid creating cycles and to ensure that the sets are always disjoint.
* **Incorrect implementation of the segment tree.** The segment tree is a data structure that stores a range of values in a tree. It is often used to perform range queries on the values. When implementing the segment tree, it is important to be careful to avoid overlapping ranges and to ensure that the values are always stored in the correct order.
* **Incorrect implementation of the binary search algorithm.** The binary search algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that finds the position of a given value in a sorted array. When implementing the binary search algorithm, it is important to be careful to avoid off-by-one errors and to ensure that the array is always sorted.
* **Incorrect implementation of the dynamic programming algorithm.** The dynamic programming algorithm is a technique for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems. When implementing the dynamic programming algorithm, it is important to be careful to avoid overlapping subproblems and to ensure that the subproblems are always solved in the correct order.
* **Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm.** The greedy algorithm is a heuristic algorithm that makes locally optimal decisions at each step in order to find a global optimum. When implementing the greedy algorithm, it is important to be careful to avoid getting stuck in local optima and to ensure that the algorithm always terminates.
* **Incorrect implementation of the brute-force algorithm.** The brute-force algorithm is an algorithm that tries all possible solutions to a problem in order to find the correct one. When implementing the brute-force algorithm, it is important to be careful to avoid exponential time complexity and to ensure that the algorithm always terminates.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems and bugs:

* **Use a debugger to help you find errors in your code.** A debugger can help you track down the source of errors in your code by allowing you to step through your code line by line and watch the values of variables change.
* **Test your code thoroughly.** You should test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is working correctly. You can test your code by using unit tests or by manually testing it.
* **Use online resources to help you solve problems.** There are many online resources available that can help you solve problems, such as online forums, tutorials, and books.
* **Ask for help from others.** If you are stuck on a problem, you can ask for help from others, such as your classmates, teachers, or online forums.

CODEFORCES 717_F. Heroes of Making Magic III

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrectly handling the input data.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. Make sure to read the problem statement carefully and understand what the input data represents.
* **Not using the correct data structures.** The problem requires you to track the number of imps in each cell. A simple array would not be sufficient for this, as you would need to be able to efficiently update the values of multiple cells at the same time. A more efficient data structure would be a doubly linked list, which allows you to quickly insert and delete elements from the middle of the list.
* **Making incorrect assumptions about the input data.** The problem statement states that the number of imps in each cell is non-negative. However, a careless developer might accidentally assume that the number of imps can be negative, which would lead to incorrect results.
* **Not handling all possible cases.** The problem statement states that the number of queries is at most 300,000. However, a careless developer might accidentally assume that the number of queries is smaller than this, which would lead to incorrect results.
* **Not using the correct algorithm.** The problem can be solved using a simple dynamic programming algorithm. However, a careless developer might accidentally use a more complex algorithm, which would be slower and less efficient.

**Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrectly handling the input data.** A developer might accidentally assume that the input data is always valid, when in fact it could be invalid. For example, the input data could contain a negative number of imps in a cell.
* **Not using the correct data structures.** A developer might use an inefficient data structure to store the number of imps in each cell. This could lead to the algorithm running slowly and using a lot of memory.
* **Making incorrect assumptions about the input data.** A developer might accidentally assume that the number of imps in each cell is always the same. This could lead to incorrect results if the number of imps in a cell changes during the course of the algorithm.
* **Not handling all possible cases.** A developer might accidentally assume that the number of queries is always less than 300,000. This could lead to incorrect results if the number of queries is greater than this.
* **Not using the correct algorithm.** A developer might accidentally use a more complex algorithm to solve the problem, when a simpler algorithm would suffice. This could lead to the algorithm running slower and using more memory.

Title:
CODEFORCES 739_B. Alyona and a tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The tree traversal algorithm should visit each vertex exactly once, and the order in which the vertices are visited should not affect the results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the distance between two vertices.** The distance between two vertices is the sum of the weights of the edges on the path from one vertex to the other. It is important to correctly account for the direction of the edges when calculating the distance.
3. **Incorrect identification of the vertices that are controlled by a given vertex.** A vertex controls another vertex if the distance from the first vertex to the second vertex is less than or equal to the second vertex's control value. It is important to correctly account for the fact that a vertex can control multiple other vertices.
4. **Incorrect output of the results.** The output should be a list of integers, one for each vertex in the tree. The integer for each vertex should be the number of vertices that the vertex controls.
5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other potential bugs that could occur when solving this problem, such as incorrect handling of edge weights, incorrect handling of negative numbers, and incorrect handling of overflow. It is important to carefully check your code for any potential bugs before submitting it.

CODEFORCES 762_A. k-th divisor

Pain points:
**1. Using a loop to iterate over all possible divisors of `n`**

This is the most straightforward approach, but it is also the most inefficient. The time complexity of this approach is `O(n*log(n))`, which is too slow for large values of `n`.

**2. Using a binary search to find the k-th smallest divisor of `n`**

This is a more efficient approach, but it is also more difficult to implement. The time complexity of this approach is `O(log(n))`, which is much faster than the previous approach.

**3. Using a sieve to find all of the divisors of `n`**

This is the most efficient approach, but it is also the most difficult to implement. The time complexity of this approach is `O(n)`, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

**4. Using a mathematical formula to find the k-th smallest divisor of `n`**

This is the most elegant approach, but it is also the most difficult to understand. The time complexity of this approach is `O(1)`, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

**5. Using a computer algebra system to find the k-th smallest divisor of `n`**

This is the most foolproof approach, but it is also the most expensive. The time complexity of this approach is `O(1)`, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

Here are some additional problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Using the wrong data type to store `n` and `k`.** This can lead to overflow errors if `n` or `k` is large.
* **Not handling the case where `n` is not divisible by any integer greater than 1.** This can lead to an infinite loop in the binary search algorithm.
* **Not handling the case where `k` is greater than the number of divisors of `n`.** This can lead to an incorrect answer.
* **Using a floating-point number to represent `n` or `k`.** This can lead to rounding errors, which can cause the wrong answer to be returned.
* **Using a library function to find the divisors of `n`.** This can be slow for large values of `n`.
* **Not testing your code thoroughly.** This can lead to bugs that are difficult to find.

CODEFORCES 831_C. Jury Marks

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the input/output.** For example, if the input is a list of integers, but the developer accidentally uses a list of strings, the program will not work correctly.
2. **Not handling edge cases.** For example, if the input is a list of integers and the list is empty, the developer should handle this case gracefully instead of crashing the program.
3. **Using incorrect algorithms.** For example, if the problem can be solved using a sorting algorithm, but the developer uses a brute-force algorithm, the program will run very slowly.
4. **Not using the right data structures.** For example, if the problem requires storing a large amount of data, using a linked list would be inefficient. A better choice would be to use a hash table or a binary search tree.
5. **Making mistakes in the code.** This is the most common type of bug, and it can be caused by a variety of factors, such as typos, logical errors, and incorrect assumptions.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand the input and output. It is also important to test your code thoroughly to make sure it handles all possible cases.

Title:
HACKEREARTH coin-counting

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly using the DP array.** The DP array should be initialized to 0, not 1.
2. **Using the wrong base case.** The base case should be when `A == 0`, not when `A < 0`.
3. **Misunderstanding the problem statement.** The problem is asking for the number of ways to make `A`, not the number of ways to make `A - 1`.
4. **Using an incorrect recurrence relation.** The correct recurrence relation is `dp[A] = dp[A - 1] + dp[A - 3] + dp[A - 5]`.
5. **Off-by-one errors.** Make sure that you are correctly handling the boundary cases, such as when `A == 1` or `A == 2`.
6. **Incorrectly using the modulo operator.** Make sure that you are using the modulo operator correctly, especially when `A` is large.

Title:
HACKEREARTH factorial-again-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 is 1, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1. However, some developers mistakenly use the modulo operator to check if a number is divisible by another number. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
if (n % 2 == 0):
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")
```

This code will print "Even" for all odd numbers, because the modulo operator will always return 1 for an odd number. To check if a number is divisible by another number, you should use the `//` operator, which returns the quotient of a division operation. For example, the following code will correctly check if a number is divisible by 2:

```
if (n // 2 == 0):
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")
```

2. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors occur when a developer forgets to add or subtract one from a calculation. For example, the following code will print the wrong answer for the sum of the first 100 numbers:

```
sum = 0
for i in range(101):
    sum = sum + i
print(sum)
```

The correct answer should be 5050, but this code will print 5051. The reason for the error is that the loop iterates over the numbers from 0 to 100, but the sum variable is incremented one too many times. To fix this error, you can change the loop condition to `for i in range(100)`.

3. **Incorrect use of recursion.** Recursion is a powerful programming technique, but it can be easy to make mistakes when using it. One common mistake is to forget to add a base case to the recursive function. A base case is a condition that stops the recursion from continuing. For example, the following recursive function will not work correctly:

```
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

This function will enter an infinite loop if you call it with a negative number or a non-integer number. To fix this error, you need to add a base case to the function, such as `if n < 0: return 1`.

4. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.** Floating-point numbers are a type of data that can represent fractional values. However, floating-point numbers are not always accurate, and they can sometimes cause rounding errors. For example, the following code will print the wrong answer for the square root of 2:

```
print(math.sqrt(2))
```

The correct answer should be 1.414213562373095, but this code will print 1.4142135623730950488016887242097. The reason for the error is that the floating-point number 1.414213562373095 is not exactly equal to the square root of 2. To avoid rounding errors, you should use the `round()` function to round floating-point numbers to the desired precision.

5. **Using the wrong data type.** Another common mistake is to use the wrong data type for a variable. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
n = "10"
print(n + 1)
```

This code will try to add the string "10" to the number 1, which will result in an error. To fix this error, you need to convert the string "10" to a number, such as `n = int("10")`.

Title:
ATCODER p02659 AtCoder Beginner Contest 169 - Multiplication 3

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect rounding**. The problem statement specifies that the fractional part should be truncated, but some developers may accidentally round the result instead. This can lead to incorrect answers, especially for large values of A and B.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. When multiplying two numbers, it is important to make sure that the product is correctly aligned. A common error is to forget to add a leading zero to the product if the multiplier is less than 10. This can lead to incorrect answers for small values of A and B.
3. **Integer overflow**. If A is large enough, the product of A and B may overflow the integer type. This can lead to incorrect answers or even a program crash. It is important to check for integer overflow before performing the multiplication.
4. **Floating-point errors**. The problem statement specifies that the fractional part of the answer should be truncated, but some programming languages may round the fractional part instead. This can lead to incorrect answers for values of B that are close to 0.
5. **Input errors**. The problem statement specifies that A and B should be integers, but some developers may accidentally enter non-integer values. This can lead to incorrect answers or a program crash.
6. **Output errors**. The problem statement specifies that the answer should be printed as an integer, but some developers may accidentally print the answer as a floating-point number. This can lead to confusion and errors.

Title:
ATCODER p02788 AtCoder Beginner Contest 153 - Silver Fox vs Monster

Pain points:
**1. Mismatch between input and output format**

The input format specifies that the first line should contain the number of monsters `N`, the range of the bombs `D`, and the damage of the bombs `A`. However, the example input does not contain the number of monsters. This could lead to a mismatch between the input and output formats, resulting in a wrong answer.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the number of bombs needed**

The problem statement states that the minimum number of bombs needed to win is the minimum number of bombs that can be used to reduce the health of all monsters to 0 or below. However, the example solution does not correctly calculate this number. For example, in the first example, the solution uses 2 bombs, but only 1 bomb is needed to reduce the health of all monsters to 0 or below.

**3. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

The problem statement does not specify how to handle edge cases, such as when the range of the bombs is 0 or when the damage of the bombs is 0. The example solution does not correctly handle these edge cases, which could lead to a wrong answer.

**4. Incorrect use of data structures**

The problem statement does not specify what data structures can be used to solve the problem. The example solution uses a list to store the monsters, but this could lead to a time complexity of O(N^2), which is not efficient for large values of N. A more efficient solution would be to use a binary search tree or a hash table.

**5. Incorrect use of algorithms**

The problem statement does not specify what algorithms can be used to solve the problem. The example solution uses a brute-force algorithm, which is not efficient for large values of N. A more efficient solution would be to use a dynamic programming algorithm.
Test inputs:

print(dp[N][N])
```
Title:
ATCODER p02924 AtCoder Beginner Contest 139 - ModSum

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**

The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. For example, 10 % 3 = 1. However, in this problem, we need to find the maximum possible value of M_1 + M_2 + ... + M_N, where M_i is the remainder when i is divided by P_i. This means that we need to find the maximum possible value of i % P_i, not the remainder of i / P_i.

To do this, we can use the following formula:

```
max(i % P_i) = (P_i - 1) % P_i
```

For example, if P_i = 3, then the maximum possible value of i % P_i is (3 - 1) % 3 = 2.

**2. Not handling the case where N is 1**

The problem states that N is an integer satisfying 1 <= N <= 10^9. However, if N is 1, then the sum of M_1 + M_2 + ... + M_N is simply 0. This is because M_1 = 0, and M_2 = 0, and so on.

To handle this case, we can simply check if N is equal to 1 before we start computing the sum. If N is equal to 1, then we can simply print 0 and exit the program.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The following algorithm is incorrect:

```
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    for j in range(1, N + 1):
        if i % j == 0:
            print(i % j)
```

This algorithm will print the remainder of i divided by j for every value of i and j. However, we only need to print the maximum possible value of i % j. To do this, we can use the following algorithm:

```
max_value = 0
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    for j in range(1, N + 1):
        if i % j == 0:
            max_value = max(max_value, i % j)
print(max_value)
```
Test inputs:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**

```

    for j in range(1, N + 1):
        if i % j == 0:
            print(i % j)
```

**2. Not handling the case where N is 1**

```
N = int(input())

if N == 1:
    print(0)
else:
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        for j in range(1, N + 1):
            if i % j == 0:
                print(i % j)
```

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

```
N = int(input())

max_value = 0
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    for j in range(1, N + 1):
        if i % j == 0:
            max_value = max(max_value, i % j)
print(max_value)
```
Title:
ATCODER p03059 AtCoder Beginner Contest 125 - Biscuit Generator

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The input variables `A`, `B`, and `T` are all integers, but the developer may accidentally use a floating-point type for one or more of them. This would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation:** The number of biscuits produced within `T + 0.5` seconds after activation is equal to `B` multiplied by the number of multiples of `A` that are less than or equal to `T + 0.5`. The developer may accidentally make a mistake in this calculation, resulting in an incorrect answer.
3. **Off-by-one error:** The developer may forget to account for the fact that the first biscuit is produced at time `A` seconds, not `A + 0.5` seconds. This would cause the program to produce an incorrect answer.
4. **Infinite loop:** The developer may accidentally create an infinite loop in their program. This could happen if the program tries to divide by zero or if it enters a state where it never terminates.
5. **Memory leak:** The developer may accidentally create a memory leak in their program. This could happen if the program allocates memory that it never frees, or if it creates too many objects.
6. **Security vulnerability:** The developer may accidentally introduce a security vulnerability in their program. This could happen if the program allows users to input malicious data, or if it fails to properly validate user input.

By following these guidelines, you can help to reduce the risk of bugs in your code.

Title:
ATCODER p03203 AtCoder Grand Contest 029 - Grid game

Pain points:
### 1. Wrong understanding of the problem

The problem states that "Takahashi would like to perform as many actions (including not moving the piece) as possible before the game ends, while Aoki would like to perform as few actions as possible before the game ends". However, some developers might misunderstand the problem and think that Takahashi wants to move the piece as many times as possible. This can lead to incorrect solutions.

### 2. Incorrect implementation of the game rules

The game rules are as follows:

* Starting from Takahashi, he and Aoki alternately perform one of the following actions:
    * Move the piece to an adjacent cell.
    * Do not move the piece, and end his turn without affecting the grid.
* The game ends when the piece does not move twice in a row.

Some developers might incorrectly implement the game rules. For example, they might not correctly implement the rule that the piece cannot move to a cell that is occupied by an obstacle. This can lead to incorrect solutions.

### 3. Incorrect calculation of the number of actions Takahashi will perform

The number of actions Takahashi will perform is equal to the number of turns he takes before the game ends. The number of turns he takes is equal to the number of times he moves the piece plus the number of times he does not move the piece. The number of times he moves the piece is equal to the number of cells he can move to minus the number of cells that are occupied by obstacles. The number of times he does not move the piece is equal to the number of turns he takes minus the number of times he moves the piece.

Some developers might incorrectly calculate the number of actions Takahashi will perform. For example, they might not correctly calculate the number of cells that are occupied by obstacles. This can lead to incorrect solutions.

### 4. Incorrect output format

The output should be the number of actions Takahashi will perform. Some developers might incorrectly output the number of turns Takahashi takes, the number of times he moves the piece, or the number of times he does not move the piece. This can lead to incorrect solutions.

Pain points:
**1. Not handling the case where all beasts are at the same position.**

The problem statement says that the beasts are at different positions, but the input format does not explicitly state this. A developer could mistakenly assume that all beasts are at the same position and write code that only works in this case. This would result in a incorrect answer.

**2. Not handling the case where the net costs more than the sum of the beasts' values.**

The problem statement says that the net costs R - L yen, but the input format does not explicitly state that R - L is always less than or equal to the sum of the beasts' values. A developer could mistakenly assume that R - L is always less than or equal to the sum of the beasts' values and write code that only works in this case. This would result in a incorrect answer.

**3. Not handling the case where the input is invalid.**

The problem statement does not explicitly state what happens if the input is invalid. A developer could mistakenly assume that the input is always valid and write code that only works in this case. This would result in a incorrect answer or a runtime error.

**4. Not using the most efficient algorithm.**

The problem can be solved in O(N) time using a simple greedy algorithm. A developer could mistakenly use a more complex algorithm that takes O(N^2) time or more. This would result in a slower solution.

ATCODER p03671 AtCoder Beginner Contest 066 - ringring

Pain points:
1. The input format is not specified clearly. Does it have to be in the format `a b c`? Or can it be in any format?
2. The output format is not specified clearly. Does it have to be the minimum total price of two different bells? Or can it be any number?
3. The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input is invalid. For example, what if `a < 1` or `b < 1` or `c < 1`?
4. The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input is equal. For example, what if `a = b = c`?
5. The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input is 0. For example, what if `a = b = c = 0`?

Title:
ATCODER p03826 AtCoder Beginner Contest 052 - Two Rectangles

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input values are integers, so you should use `int` or `long` to store them. If you use a floating-point type such as `float` or `double`, you may get incorrect results.

**2. Not checking for overflow**

When multiplying two integers, the result may overflow. For example, if you multiply two 32-bit integers that are each at their maximum value, the result will be too large to fit in a 32-bit integer and will be truncated. This can lead to incorrect results.

**3. Using the wrong formula**

The area of a rectangle is equal to the product of its length and width. So, to find the area of the rectangle with the larger area, you need to multiply the larger length by the larger width.

**4. Not handling ties correctly**

If the two rectangles have the same area, you need to print the area of either rectangle. You can do this by choosing one of the rectangles arbitrarily or by breaking ties based on some other criteria, such as the length of the longer side.

**5. Using inefficient algorithms**

There are more efficient ways to find the area of a rectangle than simply multiplying the length and width. For example, you can use the formula `area = (length + width) * (length - width) / 2`. This formula is more efficient because it only requires one multiplication and one division, whereas multiplying the length and width requires two multiplications.

Title:
ATCODER p03993 CODE FESTIVAL 2016 qual A - Friendly Rabbits

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input is a list of integers, so we need to use the `int` data type to store the values. If we use the `str` data type, we will get a runtime error.

**2. Not initializing the variables**

We need to initialize the variables before we use them. For example, we need to initialize the `count` variable to 0 before we start counting the friendly pairs.

**3. Using the wrong index**

The index of the list starts from 0, not 1. So we need to use the `i-1` index when we access the elements of the list.

**4. Not handling the corner cases**

We need to handle the corner cases, such as when the input is empty or when all the elements of the list are the same.

**5. Using the wrong algorithm**

The naive algorithm for counting the friendly pairs is to iterate over all the pairs of rabbits and check if they are friendly. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(N^2). We can improve the time complexity by using a hash table to store the pairs of rabbits that are already friendly. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(N).

Title:
AIZU p00081 A Symmetric Point

Pain points:
1. Symmetric point problems and bugs

1. **Incorrect calculation of the slope of the line passing through points P1 and P2**. The slope of the line passing through points P1 and P2 is calculated as follows:

```
m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
```

However, if the denominator is zero, the slope is undefined. In this case, the developer should handle the error appropriately.

2. **Incorrect calculation of the y-coordinate of the symmetric point**. The y-coordinate of the symmetric point is calculated as follows:

```
y = yq - 2 * m * (xq - x)
```

However, if the denominator is zero, the y-coordinate is undefined. In this case, the developer should handle the error appropriately.

3. **Incorrect rounding of the x- and y-coordinates of the symmetric point**. The x- and y-coordinates of the symmetric point should be rounded to the nearest thousandth. The developer should use the `round()` function to round the values.

4. **Incorrect output of the x- and y-coordinates of the symmetric point**. The x- and y-coordinates of the symmetric point should be printed on a single line, separated by a space. The developer should use the `print()` function to output the values.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correct. For example, the number of elements in a line is not the same, or the value of an element is out of range.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correct. For example, the number of elements in a line is not the same, or the value of an element is out of range.
3. **Memory leak**. The program does not release the memory it has allocated, which may eventually lead to a system crash.
4. **Race condition**. The program is not thread-safe, which may lead to incorrect results.
5. **Deadlock**. The program enters a deadlock state, which means that no thread can continue to execute.
6. **Buffer overflow**. The program writes data to a buffer that is not large enough, which may overwrite other data and lead to incorrect results.
7. **Format string vulnerability**. The program uses a format string incorrectly, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
8. **SQL injection**. The program does not properly sanitize user input before using it in a SQL query, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL statements and gain unauthorized access to the database.
9. **Cross-site scripting (XSS)**. The program does not properly escape user input before displaying it in the browser, which may allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the browser and execute it on the user's computer.
10. **Clickjacking**. The program allows the user to click on a link that they did not intend to click, which may lead to the user being redirected to a malicious website or having their personal information stolen.

Title:
AIZU p00590 Pair of Primes

Pain points:
* **Incorrect implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple but efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit. It works by iteratively marking all multiples of each prime number as composite, until all composite numbers have been marked. However, if the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect, it may not mark all composite numbers as such, which can lead to incorrect results.
* **Using an incorrect data type to store the prime numbers.** The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm works by marking all multiples of each prime number as composite. If the data type used to store the prime numbers is not large enough, it may overflow, which can lead to incorrect results.
* **Using an incorrect algorithm to count the number of pairs of prime numbers.** There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to count the number of pairs of prime numbers. The most efficient algorithm is the Brun's sieve algorithm, but this algorithm can be difficult to implement correctly. A simpler but less efficient algorithm is the inclusion-exclusion principle.
* **Incorrectly handling the boundary cases.** The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm must be carefully implemented to handle the boundary cases correctly. For example, the algorithm must not mark 1 as a prime number, and it must not mark any number greater than the given limit as a prime number.

By following these tips, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving the Pair of Primes problem.

Title:
AIZU p01130 Water Pipe Construction

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is given as a string, but the program expects it to be an integer. This can be fixed by using the `int()` function to convert the string to an integer.
2. **Incorrect format**. The input data is not in the correct format. The program expects the data to be in the following format:

```
n m s g1 g2
b1 b2 c
b1 b2 c
...
```

where `n` is the number of bases, `m` is the number of roads, `s` is the source base, `g1` and `g2` are the destination bases, and `b1`, `b2`, and `c` are the start and end points of a road and the cost of laying a pipe on that road, respectively.

3. **Off-by-one error**. The program incorrectly calculates the cost of laying a pipe from one base to another. This can be fixed by checking that the start and end points of the pipe are in the correct order.
4. **Infinite loop**. The program enters an infinite loop when it tries to find the shortest path from the source base to the destination bases. This can be fixed by using a different algorithm to find the shortest path, such as Dijkstra's algorithm.
5. **Memory leak**. The program leaks memory when it creates a new graph for each dataset. This can be fixed by using a garbage collector to free up memory that is no longer needed.
6. **Incorrect output**. The program outputs the wrong answer. This can be fixed by debugging the program to find the error.

* **Incorrect data type:** The data in the input file is all integers, but it is easy to make a mistake and read a string or float as an integer. This can lead to incorrect results.
* **Off-by-one errors:** The input file may contain roads that connect two post stations that are not adjacent. This can cause an off-by-one error in your code, which will lead to incorrect results.
* **Infinite loops:** If you are not careful, your code could enter an infinite loop. This can happen if you have a bug in your logic, or if you are not handling all possible cases.
* **Memory leaks:** If you are not careful, your code could leak memory. This can happen if you allocate memory that you do not free, or if you create objects that you do not delete.
* **Security vulnerabilities:** If you are not careful, your code could have security vulnerabilities. This can happen if you allow users to input data that can be used to exploit your code.

**Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:**

* **Be careful when reading the input file.** Make sure that you are correctly reading the data in the correct format.
* **Use the correct data types.** Make sure that you are using the correct data types for all of your variables.
* **Check for off-by-one errors.** Make sure that you are correctly checking for roads that connect two post stations that are not adjacent.
* **Test your code thoroughly.** Make sure that you test your code with a variety of inputs to make sure that it is working correctly.
* **Use a memory debugger.** If you are concerned about memory leaks, you can use a memory debugger to help you find and fix them.
* **Be aware of security vulnerabilities.** Make sure that you are aware of the potential security vulnerabilities in your code and take steps to mitigate them.

Title:
AIZU p01745 Cellular Automaton

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format of the problem is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input is `w = 1`, `s = 11111111`, the program will crash because the length of `s` is not equal to `22w + 1`.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the next state.** The equation for calculating the next state of a cell is given in the problem statement. However, if the calculation is not done correctly, the program may output an incorrect answer. For example, if the calculation is done incorrectly, the program may output `01011101` instead of `01011001` for `w = 1`, `s = 00011000`.
3. **Incorrect handling of boundary conditions.** The problem statement states that the cellular automaton is infinite in one dimension. However, if the program does not handle boundary conditions correctly, it may crash or output an incorrect answer. For example, if the program does not handle boundary conditions correctly, it may output `01011001` instead of `01011101` for `w = 1`, `s = 00011000`.
4. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem statement does not specify the data structures that should be used to store the state of the cellular automaton. If the wrong data structures are used, the program may crash or output an incorrect answer. For example, if a linked list is used to store the state of the cellular automaton, the program may crash when the list becomes too long.
5. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** The problem statement does not specify the algorithms that should be used to solve the problem. If the wrong algorithms are used, the program may crash or output an incorrect answer. For example, if a brute-force algorithm is used to solve the problem, the program may take a long time to run.
6. **Incorrect error handling.** The program should handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input is invalid, the program should output an error message and exit. If the program does not handle errors gracefully, it may crash or output an incorrect answer.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the constraints. It is also important to test the program thoroughly with a variety of inputs.
Test inputs:
1. ```
w = 1
s = 00011000

Title:
AIZU p01885 Escape from the Hell

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. The developer should make sure to check the input format and handle any errors appropriately.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of steps.** The minimum number of steps to escape from the hell is not always obvious. The developer should be careful to account for all possible cases, such as when the player is already on the ground floor, or when the player can jump multiple floors at once.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** The developer should be careful to avoid off-by-one errors, such as when counting the number of steps or when calculating the position of the player.
4. **Memory leaks.** The developer should be careful to free up memory that is no longer needed, in order to prevent memory leaks.
5. **Incorrect use of pointers.** The developer should be careful to use pointers correctly, in order to avoid errors such as dangling pointers and double free errors.
6. **Incorrect use of exceptions.** The developer should be careful to use exceptions correctly, in order to avoid masking errors.
7. **Incorrect use of threads.** The developer should be careful to use threads correctly, in order to avoid race conditions and deadlocks.
8. **Incorrect use of synchronization.** The developer should be careful to use synchronization correctly, in order to avoid data races and deadlocks.
9. **Incorrect use of locks.** The developer should be careful to use locks correctly, in order to avoid deadlocks and starvation.
10. **Incorrect use of mutexes.** The developer should be careful to use mutexes correctly, in order to avoid deadlocks and starvation.

Title:
AIZU p02305 Intersection

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one errors.** When computing the distance between two points, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct formula. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the formula

$$
d = \sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}
$$

**2. Floating-point errors.** When working with floating-point numbers, it is important to be aware of the possibility of rounding errors. This can cause problems when comparing two floating-point numbers to see if they are equal. To avoid this, you can use the following comparison:

```
if (a == b) {
  // do something
} else if (a < b) {
  // do something else
} else {
  // do something else
}
```

3. **Incorrect use of mathematical functions.** When using mathematical functions, it is important to make sure that you are using them correctly. For example, the square root function should only be used with non-negative numbers.

4. **Incorrect use of logical operators.** When using logical operators, it is important to make sure that you are using them correctly. For example, the expression `a && b` is true if both `a` and `b` are true.

5. **Off-by-one errors in array indexing.** When indexing into an array, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct index. For example, if you have an array of size `n`, the last element is at index `n - 1`.

6. **Incorrect use of pointers.** When using pointers, it is important to make sure that you are using them correctly. For example, you should always check to make sure that a pointer is not NULL before dereferencing it.

7. **Memory leaks.** When allocating memory, it is important to free it when you are finished with it. If you do not free the memory, you will eventually run out of memory.

8. **Synchronization errors.** When multiple threads are accessing shared data, it is important to make sure that the data is synchronized. If you do not synchronize the data, you may get incorrect results.

9. **Race conditions.** A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results.

10. **Deadlocks.** A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can cause the system to hang.

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one errors.** When comparing two arrays, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, if you are trying to find the index of an element in an array, you might accidentally compare it to the index of the element before or after it. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Indexing errors.** When iterating over an array, it is important to make sure that you are indexing the array correctly. For example, if you are trying to access the element at index `i`, you need to make sure that `i` is less than the length of the array. Otherwise, you will get an error.
3. **Boundary errors.** When working with arrays, it is important to be aware of the boundaries of the array. For example, if you are trying to access the element at index `n`, you need to make sure that `n` is less than or equal to the length of the array. Otherwise, you will get an error.
4. **Data type errors.** When comparing two arrays, it is important to make sure that the arrays are of the same data type. For example, you cannot compare an array of integers to an array of strings. This will cause a compiler error.
5. **Memory errors.** When working with arrays, it is important to be aware of the amount of memory that they are using. If you create an array that is too large, it can cause your program to run out of memory. This can lead to your program crashing.
6. **Synchronization errors.** When working with multiple threads, it is important to make sure that your code is synchronized. This means that you need to make sure that only one thread is accessing a shared resource at a time. Otherwise, you can get incorrect results.
7. **Exception handling errors.** When working with code, it is important to handle exceptions. This means that you need to make sure that your code can handle errors that occur. Otherwise, your program can crash.
8. **Security errors.** When writing code, it is important to be aware of security vulnerabilities. This means that you need to make sure that your code is not vulnerable to attacks. Otherwise, your code can be exploited by attackers.
