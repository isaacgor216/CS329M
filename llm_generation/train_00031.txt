Title:
CODECHEF equality

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, you might forget to include the newline character between the two lines of input, or you might accidentally swap the order of the two lines. This could cause the program to crash or to output incorrect results.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic for solving this problem is relatively simple, but it's easy to make a mistake. For example, you might forget to add the first term of the sum to each equation, or you might accidentally add the same term twice. This could cause the program to output incorrect results.
* **Off-by-one errors:** Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that can occur when you're working with arrays or lists. For example, you might accidentally index an array one element out of bounds, or you might accidentally add one too many or one too few elements to an array. This could cause the program to crash or to output incorrect results.
* **Memory leaks:** Memory leaks can occur when a program allocates memory but doesn't properly free it when it's finished with it. This can eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
* **Race conditions:** Race conditions can occur when two or more parts of a program try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or to crash.
* **Deadlocks:** Deadlocks can occur when two or more parts of a program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish until the other one does. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely.

**How to avoid these problems:**

* **To avoid incorrect input format,:** carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand the input format. Then, carefully type in the input data. It's also helpful to use a tool like a text editor that has a spell checker or a validator to check your input for errors.
* **To avoid incorrect logic,:** carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand the problem. Then, carefully write out the logic for solving the problem. It's also helpful to draw a diagram or to write out some test cases to help you verify that your logic is correct.
* **To avoid off-by-one errors,:** carefully count the number of elements in each array or list. Then, carefully check your code to make sure that you're indexing the arrays or lists correctly.
* **To avoid memory leaks,:** carefully free any memory that you allocate. You can use the `delete` keyword in C++ or the `gc` method in Java to free memory.
* **To avoid race conditions,:** make sure that only one part of the program is accessing a shared resource at a time. You can use locks or semaphores to protect shared resources.
* **To avoid deadlocks,:** make sure that no two parts of the program are waiting for each other to finish. You can use locks or semaphores to prevent deadlocks.

CODEFORCES 1006_F. Xor-Paths

Pain points:
 1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may not have three integers on the first line, or the numbers may not be in the correct range.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer, but the developer may output multiple integers or a string.
3. **Incorrect algorithm.** The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the developer may use a brute-force algorithm that takes exponential time, or the developer may use an algorithm that does not correctly account for all possible paths.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** The developer may make off-by-one errors when computing the xor sum of a path or when counting the number of paths.
5. **Memory errors.** The developer may not allocate enough memory to store the input or the output, or the developer may use an algorithm that uses too much memory.
6. **Time errors.** The developer's algorithm may take too long to run, even for small inputs. This could be caused by a number of factors, such as using a brute-force algorithm, using an inefficient data structure, or using an incorrect algorithm.

Here are some tips to avoid these problems:

* Carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand the input and output formats.
* Test your code with a variety of inputs, including small inputs, large inputs, and inputs with special cases.
* Use a debugger to help you find errors in your code.
* Use a profiling tool to help you identify parts of your code that are slow.
* Use a memory checker to help you identify memory leaks.
* Use a style checker to help you improve the readability and maintainability of your code.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1051_E. Vasya and Big Integers

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data is very large, so it's important to use the correct data type to store it. In this problem, the input data is a, l, and r, which are all integers. We can use `int` to store them. However, `int` has a limited range, so it's possible that the input data exceeds the range of `int`. In this case, we can use `long long` to store the data.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the number of beautiful partitions of a number a. A beautiful partition is a partition of a number such that each of its elements contains no leading zeros. We can use the following algorithm to find the number of beautiful partitions of a number:

1. Find all the possible ways to partition a number.
2. For each partition, check if it is a beautiful partition.
3. Count the number of beautiful partitions.

The first step is to find all the possible ways to partition a number. This can be done using the following algorithm:

1. Start with the empty partition.
2. For each element of the number, add it to the partition.
3. Repeat step 2 until all the elements of the number have been added to the partition.

The second step is to check if a partition is a beautiful partition. This can be done by checking if each of the elements in the partition contains no leading zeros.

The third step is to count the number of beautiful partitions. This can be done by iterating over all the possible partitions and checking if they are beautiful partitions.

This algorithm is correct, but it is very inefficient. It has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of digits in the input number.

**3. Using incorrect implementation**

The implementation of the algorithm is also important. In this problem, we need to be careful about overflow. For example, when we add an element to a partition, we need to make sure that the sum of the elements in the partition does not overflow.

We also need to be careful about modulo arithmetic. In this problem, we need to print the number of beautiful partitions modulo 998244353. We need to make sure that we correctly perform the modulo operation.

**4. Not handling special cases**

The problem statement mentions some special cases. For example, it says that the input data contains no leading zeros. We need to make sure that we handle these special cases correctly.

**5. Not testing the code**

It's important to test the code before submitting it. This will help us to catch any bugs that we may have missed. We can test the code by running it on some test cases. We can also use a debugger to help us find bugs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1073_F. Choosing Two Paths

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data structure**

The first problem that a developer might encounter is using an incorrect data structure to represent the tree. For example, using an array to store the edges of the tree would not work, as it would not be possible to efficiently find the vertices that are adjacent to a given vertex.

A better data structure to use would be a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)). A graph is a data structure that represents a set of vertices and edges, where each edge connects two vertices. In this problem, the vertices of the graph would be the nodes of the tree, and the edges would be the edges of the tree.

**2. Not using a breadth-first search**

The second problem that a developer might encounter is not using a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the paths from the two given vertices. A BFS is a recursive algorithm that starts at a given vertex and visits all of its adjacent vertices. It then repeats this process for each of the adjacent vertices that it has not already visited.

This algorithm is well-suited for finding the paths from two given vertices in a tree, as it will visit all of the vertices on the path from the first vertex to the second vertex.

**3. Not using a disjoint-set data structure**

The third problem that a developer might encounter is not using a disjoint-set data structure to find the intersection of the two paths. A disjoint-set data structure is a data structure that represents a set of disjoint sets. In this problem, the sets would be the vertices that are on the same path from the two given vertices.

This data structure is well-suited for finding the intersection of two sets, as it can efficiently find the set that a given vertex belongs to.

**4. Not using a greedy algorithm**

The fourth problem that a developer might encounter is not using a greedy algorithm to find the two pairs of vertices with the maximum number of common vertices and the maximum total length of the paths. A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that makes locally optimal choices at each step in order to find a globally optimal solution.

In this problem, a greedy algorithm would start by finding the two vertices that are on the most common path from the two given vertices. It would then find the two vertices that are on the longest path from the two given vertices.

**5. Not handling the special case of two vertices that are on the same path**

The fifth problem that a developer might encounter is not handling the special case of two vertices that are on the same path. In this case, the two pairs of vertices with the maximum number of common vertices and the maximum total length of the paths would be the same.

To handle this case, the developer would need to check if the two given vertices are on the same path. If they are, then the developer would simply output the two pairs of vertices.

**6. Not handling the special case of a tree with only two vertices**

The sixth problem that a developer might encounter is not handling the special case of a tree with only two vertices. In this case, the two pairs of vertices with the maximum number of common vertices and the maximum total length of the paths would be the same.

To handle this case, the developer would need to check if the tree has only two vertices. If it does, then the developer would simply output the two pairs of vertices.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a non-integer value, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the arithmetic mean**. The arithmetic mean is calculated incorrectly, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the sum of the elements in the subsegment is zero, the arithmetic mean is calculated as infinity, which is incorrect.
3. **Incorrect determination of the longest subsegment**. The longest subsegment is not correctly determined, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if there are two subsegments with the same maximum arithmetic mean, the program may choose the wrong one.
4. **Other bugs**. There may be other bugs in the program, such as memory leaks, race conditions, and so on. These bugs may lead to incorrect results or crashes.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully follow the input format and to correctly calculate the arithmetic mean. It is also important to correctly determine the longest subsegment. Finally, it is important to test the program thoroughly to catch any other bugs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1143_C. Queen

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the BFS algorithm.** The BFS algorithm is a very common algorithm for traversing a graph. It works by starting at a given vertex and then exploring all of its adjacent vertices. This process is repeated until all of the vertices in the graph have been visited. However, if the implementation of the BFS algorithm is incorrect, it is possible that some vertices will not be visited, which will lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the DFS algorithm.** The DFS algorithm is another common algorithm for traversing a graph. It works by starting at a given vertex and then exploring all of its unvisited adjacent vertices. This process is repeated until all of the vertices in the graph have been visited. However, if the implementation of the DFS algorithm is incorrect, it is possible that some vertices will not be visited, which will lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** There are a number of edge cases that need to be handled when solving this problem. For example, what happens if the input graph is not a tree? What happens if there are no vertices that do not respect their parents? What happens if there are no vertices that do not respect their children? If these edge cases are not handled correctly, it is possible that the program will crash or produce incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The data structures used to represent the graph and the vertices in the graph can have a significant impact on the performance of the program. If the data structures are not used correctly, it is possible that the program will run slowly or even crash.
5. **Incorrect use of memory.** The program may use too much memory if it is not careful about how it allocates and frees memory. This can lead to the program crashing or running slowly.
6. **Incorrect error handling.** The program should handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input file is not found or if the input data is invalid, the program should print an error message and exit. If errors are not handled gracefully, it is possible that the program will crash or produce incorrect results.

**Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:**

1. **Test your code thoroughly.** This is the best way to find errors in your code. Make sure to test your code with a variety of input data, including edge cases.
2. **Use a debugger.** A debugger can help you to identify errors in your code. It can show you where the code is crashing or producing incorrect results.
3. **Read the documentation carefully.** The documentation for the programming language and the libraries that you are using can help you to avoid errors.
4. **Ask for help from others.** If you are stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help from others. There are many online forums and communities where you can get help with programming problems.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs that developers encounter when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1163_C1. Power Transmission (Easy Edition)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the brute force algorithm**. The brute force algorithm for this problem is to iterate over all pairs of points and check if the lines connecting them intersect. This can be done by computing the equation of the line connecting the two points and then checking if the line intersects any other line in the set. However, this algorithm is very inefficient, as it has a time complexity of O(n^2).
2. **Incorrect implementation of the divide and conquer algorithm**. The divide and conquer algorithm for this problem is to recursively divide the set of points into two halves and then check if any pairs of points in different halves intersect. This algorithm is more efficient than the brute force algorithm, with a time complexity of O(n log n). However, it is important to implement the algorithm correctly, as a mistake in the implementation can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers**. When working with floating-point numbers, it is important to be aware of the rounding errors that can occur. This is especially important when computing the equation of a line, as small rounding errors can cause the line to be incorrectly classified as intersecting another line.
4. **Incorrect handling of degenerate cases**. The problem statement specifies that the points representing the poles are distinct. However, it is possible for two points to be very close together, such that they appear to be on top of each other. In this case, it is important to handle the case correctly, as incorrectly handling this case can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect use of the sorting algorithm**. The sorting algorithm is a fundamental tool in computer science, and it is important to use it correctly. When sorting a set of points, it is important to use a stable sorting algorithm, as this will ensure that the order of the points is preserved after sorting.
6. **Incorrect use of the hash table**. The hash table is a powerful data structure that can be used to store and retrieve data efficiently. However, it is important to use the hash table correctly, as a mistake in the implementation can lead to incorrect results.
7. **Incorrect use of the binary search algorithm**. The binary search algorithm is a very efficient algorithm for searching for a value in a sorted array. However, it is important to use the binary search algorithm correctly, as a mistake in the implementation can lead to incorrect results.
8. **Incorrect use of the dynamic programming algorithm**. The dynamic programming algorithm is a powerful algorithm for solving a wide variety of problems. However, it is important to use the dynamic programming algorithm correctly, as a mistake in the implementation can lead to incorrect results.

CODEFORCES 1184_A1. Heidi Learns Hashing (Easy)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the hashing function.** The hashing function defined in the problem statement is `H(x,y):=x^2+2xy+x+1`. A common mistake is to forget to add the 1 at the end, which would result in a different function.
2. **Incorrect use of the quadratic formula.** The quadratic formula is used to solve equations of the form `ax^2+bx+c=0`. In this problem, we need to solve the equation `H(x,y)=r` for `x`. However, the quadratic formula only gives us the solutions for `y`, so we need to use some additional algebraic manipulation to find `x`.
3. **Incorrect handling of special cases.** The problem statement states that `1 ≤ r ≤ 10^{12}`. However, the quadratic formula can only be used to solve equations with real solutions. This means that we need to handle the special cases where `r` is negative or not a perfect square.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The problem statement specifies that the output should be two integers `x` and `y` such that `H(x,y)=r` and `x` is smallest possible. However, a common mistake is to output the two integers in the wrong order or to output them as a single string.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** If there is no pair of integers `x` and `y` such that `H(x,y)=r`, the problem statement specifies that we should output the string `"NO"`. However, a common mistake is to output an empty string or to output an incorrect error message.

CODEFORCES 1201_D. Treasure Hunting

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, you might accidentally read the number of rows as the number of columns, or you might forget to include a space between two numbers. This can lead to the program crashing or giving incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem requires you to keep track of the location of the treasures and the safe columns. You could use a two-dimensional array to store this information, but this would be inefficient. A better approach would be to use a linked list or a hash table.
3. **Incorrect algorithm.** The optimal way to solve this problem is to start from the bottom row and work your way up. At each step, you need to decide whether to move up, left, or right. The best choice depends on the location of the treasures and the safe columns.
4. **Incorrect implementation.** Even if you have a correct algorithm, you still need to implement it correctly. This means paying attention to details like variable initialization and error handling. A small mistake in the implementation can lead to incorrect results or a program crash.
5. **Failure to test the code.** It's important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it. This means running the code on a variety of different inputs and checking for errors. You should also make sure that your code is efficient and runs within the time limit.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that you might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** You might accidentally read the number of rows as the number of columns, or you might forget to include a space between two numbers. This can lead to the program crashing or giving incorrect results.

```
n, m, k, q = map(int, input().split())
```

* **Incorrect use of data structures:** You could use a two-dimensional array to store the location of the treasures and the safe columns, but this would be inefficient. A better approach would be to use a linked list or a hash table.

```
treasures = []
for _ in range(k):
    r, c = map(int, input().split())
    treasures.append((r, c))

safe_columns = []
for _ in range(q):
    c = int(input())
    safe_columns.append(c)
```

* **Incorrect algorithm:** The optimal way to solve this problem is to start from the bottom row and work your way up. At each step, you need to decide whether to move up, left, or right. The best choice depends on the location of the treasures and the safe columns.

```
for r in range(n-1, -1, -1):
    for c in range(m):
        if (r, c) in treasures:
            continue

            moves = r + 1
        else:
            moves = min(moves, r + 1, c + 1, m - c + 1)
    print(moves)
```

* **Incorrect implementation:** Even if you have a correct algorithm, you still need to implement it correctly. This means paying attention to details like variable initialization and error handling. A small mistake in the implementation can lead to incorrect results or a program crash.

```

CODEFORCES 1506_A. Strange Table

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data contains very large numbers, so you need to use at least the 64-bit integer type. Otherwise, you will get a "wrong answer" verdict.

**2. Using incorrect formulas**

The formulas for converting from the "by columns" numbering to the "by rows" numbering are as follows:

* `row = x // m`
* `col = x % m`

If you use incorrect formulas, you will get a "wrong answer" verdict.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When you are converting from the "by columns" numbering to the "by rows" numbering, you need to make sure that you add 1 to the row number. Otherwise, you will get a "wrong answer" verdict.

**4. Missing boundary checks**

The input data may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers that are greater than `10^18`. If you do not perform boundary checks, your program may crash or give incorrect results.

**5. Using incorrect algorithms**

There are many different algorithms that you can use to solve this problem. However, not all of them are correct. Make sure that you use an algorithm that is guaranteed to give the correct answer.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1529_B. Sifid and Strange Subsequences

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is an array of integers. If you use the wrong data type to store the array, it may cause overflow and lead to incorrect results. For example, if you use `int` to store the array, and the array contains a very large integer, it may overflow and be stored as a negative number. This will cause the algorithm to give incorrect results.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem is asking for the length of the longest strange subsequence. A strange subsequence is a subsequence whose absolute difference between any pair of its elements is greater than or equal to the maximum element in the sequence. One possible algorithm to solve this problem is to sort the array and then iterate through the array, keeping track of the longest strange subsequence seen so far. However, this algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n), which is too slow for large input.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement does not explicitly mention any edge cases. However, there are a few edge cases that you should be aware of. For example, if the input array is empty, the longest strange subsequence is empty. Similarly, if the input array contains only one element, the longest strange subsequence is also one element long.

**4. Incorrect implementation**

Even if you use the correct data type and algorithm, you may still make mistakes in your implementation. For example, you may forget to initialize variables, or you may make a mistake in your logic. These mistakes can lead to incorrect results.

**5. Not debugging your code**

Once you have written your code, it is important to debug it to make sure that it is correct. You can do this by running your code on a few test cases and checking the results. You can also use a debugger to help you track down errors in your code.

CODEFORCES 202_E. Fragile Bridges

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. The first line should contain a single integer n, which is the number of platforms. The second line should contain (n - 1) integers a<sub>i</sub>, which are the number of transitions that the bridge between platforms i and i + 1 can bear. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer, which is the maximum number of points that a player can get on the bonus level. If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly output the answer and will likely crash.

**3. Undefined behavior**

The program may exhibit undefined behavior if it is not properly written. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as accessing memory that has not been allocated, dividing by zero, or using uninitialized variables. If undefined behavior occurs, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

**4. Runtime errors**

The program may also experience runtime errors. These are errors that occur during the execution of the program, such as a segmentation fault or a floating-point exception. Runtime errors can be caused by a variety of factors, such as incorrect input, invalid operations, or memory leaks.

**5. Logic errors**

Title:
CODEFORCES 227_D. Naughty Stone Piles

Pain points:
### Possible Problems and Bugs

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading in the data. For example, you might accidentally read in the number of piles as a string instead of an integer, or you might forget to include the space between the two parts of the input. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**. The algorithm for solving this problem is not particularly difficult, but it's important to make sure that you implement it correctly. For example, you might accidentally add two piles together in the wrong order, or you might forget to update the cost of the operation. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format for this problem is also very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, you might accidentally print the answer to one query on the same line as the answer to another query, or you might forget to put a space between the answers. This can lead to your submission being rejected.
4. **Runtime errors**. The time limit for this problem is very tight, so it's important to make sure that your code is as efficient as possible. For example, you might accidentally use a recursive algorithm when a iterative algorithm would be more efficient, or you might use a slow sorting algorithm when a faster one would be available. This can lead to your submission being timed out.
5. **Memory errors**. The memory limit for this problem is also very tight, so it's important to make sure that your code doesn't use too much memory. For example, you might accidentally create an array that's too big, or you might keep track of too much information in memory. This can lead to your submission being rejected.

To avoid these problems, it's important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. You should also carefully test your code to make sure that it produces the correct results. Finally, you should make sure that your code is efficient and doesn't use too much memory.

Title:
CODEFORCES 251_B. Playing with Permutations

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is two integers n and k, followed by a permutation q and then a permutation s. However, if the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce incorrect output. For example, if the input is "4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4", the program will not be able to parse the input correctly and will produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be either "YES" or "NO". However, if the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly produce output and will produce incorrect output. For example, if the output is "yes", the program will not be able to correctly produce output and will produce incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic for this problem is relatively simple. First, we need to check if the input format is correct. If the input format is correct, we need to check if the output format is correct. If both the input format and the output format are correct, we need to check if the given permutations are possible. If the given permutations are possible, we need to print "YES". Otherwise, we need to print "NO".

**4. Incorrect implementation**

The implementation for this problem is also relatively simple. First, we need to define the functions that we need to solve the problem. Then, we need to call these functions to solve the problem. Finally, we need to print the output.

**5. Runtime errors**

The program may also encounter runtime errors. For example, if the program runs out of memory, it will crash. Or, if the program tries to access an invalid memory address, it will also crash.

**6. Logical errors**

The program may also encounter logical errors. For example, if the program assumes that the input is always correct, it may produce incorrect output. Or, if the program assumes that the output format is always correct, it may also produce incorrect output.

**7. Other errors**

There are a number of other errors that the program may encounter. For example, the program may encounter errors due to compiler bugs. Or, the program may encounter errors due to operating system bugs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 276_C. Little Girl and Maximum Sum

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input format is not "n q\n a_1 a_2 ... a_n\n l_1 r_1\n l_2 r_2 ...", the program may not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect array indexing**. The array elements are indexed starting from 1, but the program may use a different indexing scheme. For example, if the program uses 0-based indexing, it will incorrectly calculate the sum of array elements.
3. **Incorrect query processing**. The queries are defined by a pair of integers l_i, r_i, but the program may only consider one of the two integers. For example, if the program only considers the left index l_i, it will incorrectly calculate the sum of query replies.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the output format is not "ans", the program may not be able to print the output correctly.
5. **Memory leak**. The program may not release the memory that it has allocated, which may eventually lead to a memory leak.
6. **Deadlock**. The program may enter a deadlock state, where it is unable to continue execution. This can happen if the program is waiting for a resource that is never released.
7. **Race condition**. The program may not be thread-safe, which can lead to incorrect results. This can happen if two or more threads are accessing the same data at the same time.
8. **Buffer overflow**. The program may write data to a buffer that is not large enough, which can lead to data corruption. This can happen if the program does not check the size of the buffer before writing to it.
9. **Format string vulnerability**. The program may use a format string that is not properly escaped, which can lead to a security vulnerability. This can happen if the program allows the user to provide input that is used as a format string.
10. **SQL injection**. The program may not properly escape user input before using it in a SQL query, which can lead to a security vulnerability. This can happen if the program allows the user to provide input that is used in a SQL query.

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrectly calculating the maximum profit.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. To avoid this mistake, be sure to carefully track the current profit and the maximum profit that has been seen so far.
2. **Not considering all possible trades.** When trying to find the maximum profit, it is important to consider all possible trades. This means considering all possible days to buy and sell the stock, as well as all possible quantities to buy and sell.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others, so it is important to choose the right algorithm for the problem at hand.
4. **Making a runtime error.** This can happen if the algorithm is not written efficiently or if the input data is too large. To avoid this, be sure to test your algorithm on a variety of input data sets before submitting it to the competition.
5. **Getting the wrong answer.** This can happen if the algorithm is incorrect or if the input data is incorrect. To avoid this, be sure to carefully check your work and to double-check the input data.
Test inputs:

Title:
CODEFORCES 414_E. Mashmokh's Designed Problem

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the dfs function.** The dfs function should visit all the vertices in the tree and add them to the result sequence. However, if the implementation is incorrect, some vertices may not be visited and the result sequence may be incomplete.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the distance between two vertices.** The distance between two vertices is the number of edges in the shortest path between them. However, if the implementation is incorrect, the distance may be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect handling of the second-type query.** The second-type query disconnects v from its father and connects it to its h-th ancestor. However, if the implementation is incorrect, v may not be disconnected from its father or it may be connected to the wrong ancestor.
4. **Incorrect handling of the third-type query.** The third-type query finds the latest vertex that has distance k from the root. However, if the implementation is incorrect, the returned vertex may not be the latest vertex with distance k from the root.
5. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific. If the input format is not correct, the program may not be able to parse the input and will produce incorrect output.
6. **Incorrect output format.** The output format for this problem is also very specific. If the output format is not correct, the program may not be able to produce the correct output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 441_C. Valera and Tubes 

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not as expected. For example, the input may not have three space-separated integers, or the integers may not be in the correct range.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not as expected. For example, the output may not have the correct number of lines, or the lines may not be formatted correctly.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The solution may not be correct. For example, the solution may not place all of the tubes on the table, or the tubes may not be arranged in a fancy manner.
4. **Memory leaks.** The solution may not free up memory that it allocated. This can lead to a memory overflow and cause the program to crash.
5. **Race conditions.** The solution may not be thread-safe. This can lead to incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.
6. **Security vulnerabilities.** The solution may not be secure. This can allow attackers to gain access to sensitive data or to execute arbitrary code on the system.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design and test your solution. You should also use a debugger to help you identify and fix any errors.

CODEFORCES 463_D. Gargari and Permutations

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always as expected. For example, the input may contain spaces between the numbers, or the numbers may be in a different order.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not always as expected. For example, the output may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may be in a different order.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When computing the length of the longest common subsequence, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, you might accidentally count a number that is not in the longest common subsequence.
4. **Memory errors.** If the input is large, you may run out of memory. To avoid this, you can use a more efficient data structure, such as a hash table.
5. **Time errors.** If the input is large, your algorithm may take too long to run. To avoid this, you can use a more efficient algorithm, such as a dynamic programming algorithm.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* **Be careful to read the input format carefully.** If you are not sure about the input format, you can ask for clarification from the problem statement.
* **Test your code on a variety of inputs.** This will help you to catch any errors in your code.
* **Use a debugger to help you track down errors.** A debugger can help you to see where your code is going wrong.
* **Use a more efficient data structure or algorithm.** If your code is running slowly, you can try using a more efficient data structure or algorithm.
* **Break your code down into smaller functions.** This can help you to debug your code more easily.
* **Use comments to explain your code.** This can help other people to understand your code.

Title:
CODEFORCES 487_C. Prefix Product Sequence

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly parsed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is "123", the program may interpret it as "1, 2, 3", which is incorrect.
2. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may not consider all possible cases, or it may make incorrect assumptions about the input.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the program may be incorrect, which may make it difficult to understand the results. For example, the program may print the results in a different order than expected, or it may use incorrect formatting.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program may not properly release memory that it has allocated, which may lead to a memory leak. A memory leak can eventually cause the program to crash.
5. **Race conditions**. The program may not be thread-safe, which may lead to incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data simultaneously.
6. **Deadlocks**. The program may deadlock, which means that it will stop running and never finish. A deadlock can occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource that they both need.
7. **Buffer overflows**. The program may write data to a buffer that is not large enough, which may overwrite other data in memory. A buffer overflow can lead to a security vulnerability.
8. **Format string vulnerabilities**. The program may use a format string incorrectly, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. A format string vulnerability is a serious security vulnerability.
9. **SQL injection vulnerabilities**. The program may not properly sanitize user input before using it in a SQL statement, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. A SQL injection vulnerability is a serious security vulnerability.
10. **Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities**. The program may not properly escape user input before sending it to the client, which may allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the browser. An XSS vulnerability is a serious security vulnerability.

Title:
CODEFORCES 510_B. Fox And Two Dots

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, or if the input contains a string that is not a valid color, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if the output contains a character that is not a letter, or if the output is not a valid sentence, the program will crash.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic of the program is the most important part, and it is easy to make a mistake here. For example, if the program does not check if the input is valid, or if the program does not correctly find all of the cycles, the program will give the wrong answer.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that can occur when programming. This type of error occurs when the programmer accidentally counts one more or one less than they should. For example, if the program is supposed to find all of the cycles in a graph, but the programmer accidentally skips one cycle, the program will give the wrong answer.

**5. Memory leaks**

Memory leaks occur when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.

**6. Race conditions**

Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to crash or to give the wrong answer.

**7. Deadlocks**

Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely.

Title:
CODEFORCES 535_C. Tavas and Karafs

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. The developer should check the input format carefully and handle any errors appropriately.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correctly followed. For example, the output may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be formatted correctly. The developer should check the output format carefully and make sure that it is correct.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm for solving the problem. This could lead to incorrect results or timeout errors. The developer should carefully design and implement the algorithm, and test it thoroughly to ensure that it is correct.
4. **Incorrect data structures**. The developer may use incorrect data structures to store the input data or the intermediate results. This could lead to incorrect results or memory errors. The developer should carefully choose the appropriate data structures for the problem, and use them correctly.
5. **Incorrect error handling**. The developer may not handle errors correctly. This could lead to incorrect results or program crashes. The developer should carefully handle all possible errors, and make sure that the program continues to run correctly even if an error occurs.
6. **Incorrect testing**. The developer may not test the program thoroughly. This could lead to incorrect results or bugs that are not caught until the program is released. The developer should test the program with a variety of input data, and make sure that it produces the correct results in all cases.

Title:
CODEFORCES 55_D. Beautiful numbers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line of the input contains the number of cases t, and each of the next t lines contains two natural numbers li and ri. However, a developer may accidentally read the input incorrectly, for example, by reading the number of cases t as a single integer instead of a line of text. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect use of 64-bit integers**. The problem statement specifies that the input and output should be 64-bit integers. However, a developer may accidentally use 32-bit integers, which would cause the program to overflow and produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect calculation of beautiful numbers**. The problem statement states that a number is beautiful if and only if it is divisible by each of its nonzero digits. However, a developer may accidentally calculate the number of beautiful numbers incorrectly, for example, by only considering the last digit of each number. This would cause the program to produce incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The problem statement specifies that the output should contain t numbers, one per line. However, a developer may accidentally output the numbers in a different format, such as all on one line or with spaces between them. This would cause the output to be incorrect.

CODEFORCES 586_A. Alena's Schedule

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain a positive integer n, and the second line should contain n numbers ai. However, the input may contain an incorrect number of lines, or the first line may not contain a positive integer, or the second line may not contain n numbers.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single number, representing the number of pairs during which Alena stays at the university. However, the output may contain multiple numbers, or a non-numeric value.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of pairs.** The number of pairs during which Alena stays at the university is equal to the number of pairs in her schedule, minus the number of breaks that are at least two pairs long. However, the developer may incorrectly calculate the number of pairs in her schedule, or the number of breaks that are at least two pairs long.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The developer may incorrectly implement the logic for determining whether Alena goes home or stays at the university. For example, the developer may incorrectly check whether a break is at least two pairs long, or the developer may incorrectly determine when Alena goes home.
5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other potential bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem, such as incorrect memory management, incorrect error handling, and incorrect use of the programming language.

Title:
CODEFORCES 608_B. Hamming Distance Sum

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly computing the Hamming distance.** The Hamming distance between two strings is the number of positions where the two strings differ. A common mistake is to count the number of characters that are different in the two strings, but this will not give the correct answer. For example, the Hamming distance between the strings "0011" and "0110" is 2, not 3.
2. **Not considering all possible substrings of the longer string.** The problem statement asks for the sum of the Hamming distances between the shorter string and all contiguous substrings of the longer string. A common mistake is to only consider the substrings that start at the beginning of the longer string. For example, if the shorter string is "01" and the longer string is "0110", then the substrings "01", "11", and "011" should all be considered.
3. **Using incorrect data types.** The problem statement specifies that the strings are guaranteed to consist of characters '0' and '1' only. A common mistake is to use a data type that can store other characters, such as a string or a character array. This can lead to incorrect results if the strings contain characters other than '0' and '1'.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** The Hamming distance between two strings is often computed by iterating over the two strings and comparing each character. A common mistake is to forget to increment the index of one of the strings when comparing characters. This can lead to an incorrect answer if the two strings are not of the same length.
5. **Incorrectly handling the end of the strings.** When computing the Hamming distance between two strings, it is important to handle the end of the strings correctly. A common mistake is to only consider the characters that are in both strings. This can lead to an incorrect answer if the two strings are not of the same length.
6. **Using inefficient algorithms.** The Hamming distance between two strings can be computed in O(n) time, where n is the length of the shorter string. A common mistake is to use an inefficient algorithm, such as a brute-force algorithm, which can take O(n^2) time.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a negative number or a number greater than 100.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output must be either "YES" or "NO", but it may contain other characters.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code may not correctly determine whether the Venusian girl and the Marsian boy can hold hands so that both are comfortable. For example, the code may not consider the case where the boy goes to the left of the girl.
4. **Runtime error**. The code may run out of time or memory.

CODEFORCES 653_G. Move by Prime

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains integers that can be up to 300,000. If you use an integer data type to store these numbers, you may get an overflow error. To avoid this, you can use a long long data type.

**2. Not handling the empty subsequence correctly**

The input may contain an empty subsequence. If you don't handle this case correctly, you may get a wrong answer. To handle this case, you can add a special case to your code that handles the empty subsequence.

**3. Not considering the modulo operation**

The output should be modulo 109 + 7. If you don't consider the modulo operation, you may get a wrong answer. To avoid this, you can use the % operator to perform the modulo operation.

**4. Making a mistake in the calculation**

It's easy to make a mistake in the calculation of the minimum number of operations. To avoid this, you should carefully check your code.

**5. Not using a fast enough algorithm**

The problem can be solved in O(n log n) time. If you use a slower algorithm, you may not get the answer in time. To solve the problem in O(n log n) time, you can use a divide and conquer algorithm.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the output contains a number that is not an integer, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect variable names**. The variable names should be descriptive and easy to understand. Using unclear or confusing variable names can make the program difficult to read and debug.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program should be correct and efficient. Using incorrect or inefficient logic can lead to errors in the program.
5. **Incorrect use of functions**. The functions should be used correctly and efficiently. Using incorrect or inefficient functions can lead to errors in the program.
6. **Incorrect error handling**. The program should handle errors correctly. Not handling errors correctly can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
7. **Incorrect testing**. The program should be tested thoroughly. Not testing the program thoroughly can lead to errors in the program.

Title:
CODEFORCES 724_A. Checking the Calendar

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format specified in the problem statement is:

```
The input consists of two lines, each of them containing the name of exactly one day of the week. It's guaranteed that each string in the input is from the set "monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday", "saturday", "sunday".
```

A developer may incorrectly parse the input, for example, by not checking that the input is a string or by not checking that the string is in the correct format. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the number of days in a month**

The number of days in a month depends on whether the year is a leap year or not. In a non-leap year, the months of January, March, May, July, August, October, and December have 31 days, while the months of April, June, September, and November have 30 days. February has 28 days in a non-leap year.

A developer may incorrectly calculate the number of days in a month, for example, by assuming that all months have 30 days or by assuming that February has 29 days in a non-leap year. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the day of the week**

The day of the week is calculated by taking the remainder of the number of days since January 1, 1970 modulo 7. For example, the day of the week for January 1, 2023 is 6 (Saturday).

A developer may incorrectly calculate the day of the week, for example, by using the wrong starting date or by using the wrong modulo operator. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.

**4. Incorrect logic**

The logic used to solve the problem is not correct. For example, the developer may assume that the first day of a month is always a Sunday, or that the first day of the next month is always the day after the last day of the previous month. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.

**5. Incorrect output format**

The output format specified in the problem statement is:

```
Print "YES" (without quotes) if such situation is possible during some non-leap year. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).
```

A developer may incorrectly format the output, for example, by not capitalizing the letters in "YES" or "NO". This could lead to the program being marked incorrect even if the logic is correct.
Test inputs:
**1. Incorrect input format**

```

Title:
CODEFORCES 746_A. Compote

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is given as integers, so the developer should use the `int` data type to store the values. Using a different data type, such as `float` or `string`, could lead to incorrect results.

**2. Not checking for invalid input**

The input data may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers that are greater than the maximum allowed value. The developer should check for invalid input and handle it appropriately.

**3. Using incorrect math operations**

The problem requires the developer to find the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to make compote. The developer should use the correct math operations to calculate this value.

**4. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a simple algorithm that iterates through the input data and finds the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use. However, there are more efficient algorithms that can be used to solve this problem.

**5. Not handling errors correctly**

The program may encounter errors during execution, such as running out of memory or a divide by zero error. The developer should handle these errors correctly to prevent the program from crashing.

Title:
CODEFORCES 769_A. Year of University Entrance

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n, and the second line should contain n distinct integers. However, a developer may accidentally forget to check that n is an integer, or that the second line contains n distinct integers. This could lead to a variety of errors, such as the program crashing or outputting incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve this problem is relatively simple, but there are a few ways that a developer could make a mistake. For example, the developer might forget to check that the input data is valid, or they might not correctly account for the fact that Igor may join multiple groups. This could lead to the program crashing or outputting incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the program should print a single integer, which is the year of Igor's university entrance. However, a developer may accidentally print the wrong value, or they may not print anything at all. This could lead to the program crashing or receiving a incorrect score on the competition.
4. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other potential bugs that a developer could encounter when solving this problem. For example, the developer might accidentally use the wrong variable name, or they might forget to initialize a variable. These types of bugs can be difficult to find and fix, so it is important to be careful when writing code.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect datatype**. The input is a list of integers, but the code is expecting a list of strings. This will cause a ValueError.
2. **Incorrect index**. The code is trying to access the element at index 0 of the list, but the list is empty. This will cause a IndexError.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The code is expecting the last element of the list to be the destination city, but it is actually the next-to-last element. This will cause the code to incorrectly calculate the expected length of the journey.
4. **Infinite loop**. The code is using a while loop to iterate over the list of cities, but it does not have a condition to stop the loop. This will cause the code to run forever.
5. **Incorrect calculation**. The code is incorrectly calculating the expected length of the journey. It is adding the lengths of all the roads in the list, but it should be adding the lengths of all the roads from the starting city to the destination city.
6. **Memory leak**. The code is not releasing the memory that it is using for the list of cities. This can cause the program to run out of memory.
7. **Security vulnerability**. The code is not properly validating the input. This could allow a malicious user to inject code into the program.

To avoid these problems, be sure to carefully check your code for errors before submitting it. Use a debugger to help you identify any problems. And make sure to test your code on a variety of inputs to make sure that it works correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 984_A. Game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specified in the problem statement is `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. However, a developer may accidentally read the input incorrectly, for example, by reading the list of integers first and then the value of `n`. This would result in an incorrect solution.
2. **Incorrect algorithm.** The optimal solution to this problem is to always choose the smallest remaining integer on the board. However, a developer may accidentally implement a different algorithm, such as always choosing the largest remaining integer. This would result in an incorrect solution.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over the list of integers, a developer may accidentally iterate one index too far or not far enough. This would result in an incorrect solution.
4. **Memory errors.** If the list of integers is very large, a developer may not allocate enough memory to store it. This would result in a segmentation fault or other runtime error.
5. **Timeout errors.** If the algorithm takes too long to run, the judge may time it out and return a Wrong Answer verdict. This could happen if the algorithm is inefficient or if the list of integers is very large.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully read the problem statement and implement the solution correctly. They should also test their code thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly on all possible inputs.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain a number that is too large or too small. The developer should check the input format and handle incorrect input gracefully.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correctly followed. For example, the output may contain a number that is not in the correct format. The developer should check the output format and handle incorrect output gracefully.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm that does not give the correct answer. For example, the developer may not consider all possible cases or may make a mistake in the calculation. The developer should carefully design and implement the algorithm to ensure that it gives the correct answer.
4. **Incorrect data structure**. The developer may use an incorrect data structure to store the data. For example, the developer may use a linked list to store the data when a hash table would be more efficient. The developer should carefully choose the data structure to use to ensure that it is efficient and effective.
5. **Incorrect error handling**. The developer may not handle errors correctly. For example, the developer may not catch an exception that is thrown by the code. The developer should carefully handle errors to ensure that the code does not crash or produce incorrect results.
6. **Incorrect unit testing**. The developer may not unit test the code correctly. For example, the developer may not test all possible cases or may not test the code in different ways. The developer should unit test the code to ensure that it is correct and works as expected.
7. **Incorrect integration testing**. The developer may not integration test the code correctly.

HACKEREARTH cricket-rating-30

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input ratings are given as integers, but the code is using them as strings. This will cause errors when trying to perform mathematical operations on them.
2. **Incorrect loop condition**. The code is using a `while` loop to iterate over the ratings, but the condition is not checking for the end of the list. This will cause the loop to run indefinitely.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum sum**. The code is adding each rating to the running total, but it is not checking to see if the total is positive. This will cause the maximum sum to be incorrect if there are any negative ratings in the list.
4. **Incorrect output**. The code is printing the running total, not the maximum sum. This will cause the output to be incorrect.

To fix these problems, you can do the following:

1. Change the variable type of the ratings to integers.
2. Correct the loop condition to check for the end of the list.
3. Add a check to make sure the total is positive before adding it to the running total.
4. Print the maximum sum, not the running total.

Title:
HACKEREARTH joker-vs-batman

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect Modulo Operator**

The modulo operator `%` in Python returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second operand. For example, `10 % 3` returns 1 because 10 divided by 3 has a remainder of 1. However, if the second operand is greater than the first operand, the modulo operator will return the first operand. For example, `10 % 11` returns 10 because 10 divided by 11 has a remainder of 10.

This can be a problem when you are trying to calculate the distance that Batman has to travel. For example, in the problem statement, the distance of the first bomb is `x` and the modulo is `M`. If `x` is greater than `M`, the modulo operator will return `x` instead of the remainder of the division of `x` by `M`. This will result in an incorrect answer.

To avoid this problem, you can use the `divmod()` function to calculate the quotient and remainder of the division of `x` by `M`. The `divmod()` function returns a tuple of two values, the first value is the quotient and the second value is the remainder. You can then use the remainder to calculate the distance that Batman has to travel.

**2. Using the Wrong Data Type**

Another common mistake that developers make when solving this problem is using the wrong data type. The problem statement states that the distance of the first bomb is `x` and the modulo is `M`. Both `x` and `M` can be very large numbers, so you need to use a data type that can store these large numbers.

The `int` data type is the default data type for integers in Python. However, the `int` data type can only store numbers up to a certain size. If you try to store a number that is larger than the maximum size of the `int` data type, Python will raise an error.

To avoid this problem, you can use the `long` data type. The `long` data type can store numbers of any size.

**3. Not Using the Right Algorithm**

The most efficient way to solve this problem is to use the following algorithm:

1. Initialize a variable `d` to 0.
2. For each bomb, add the distance of the bomb to `d`.
3. Divide `d` by `M` and get the remainder.
4. Return the remainder.

This algorithm is efficient because it only requires a single loop to calculate the distance that Batman has to travel.

**4. Not Handling Special Cases**

The problem statement states that `N` can be 1. However, the algorithm above will not work if `N` is 1. To handle this special case, you can add a check at the beginning of the algorithm to make sure that `N` is greater than 1.

**5. Not Using Unit Testing**

It is important to write unit tests for your code to make sure that it is correct. Unit tests are small pieces of code that test individual units of your code. They can help you to identify bugs in your code and to make sure that your code is working correctly.

To write unit tests for this problem, you can create a test case for each of the following scenarios:

* The distance of the first bomb is 1 and the modulo is 10.
* The distance of the first bomb is 2 and the modulo is 10.
* The distance of the first bomb is 5 and the modulo is 3.
* The distance of the first bomb is 8 and the modulo is 100.
* The distance of the first bomb is 10 and the modulo is 10.

By writing unit tests for these scenarios, you can make sure that your code is working correctly for all possible inputs.

HACKEREARTH rescue-the-hackland

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of data types**

The input consists of three integers, L, R, and K. The problem statement states that L, R, and K are all integers. However, the code below incorrectly uses the float data type for L, R, and K. This can lead to incorrect results.

```
def solve():
    L, R, K = map(float, input().split())
    print(1 if (R - L) % K == 0 else 0)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        solve()
```

The correct code should use the integer data type for L, R, and K.

```
def solve():
    L, R, K = map(int, input().split())
    print(1 if (R - L) % K == 0 else 0)


if __name__ == '__main__':

        solve()
```

**2. Incorrect use of modulo operator**

The problem statement states that a volatile grey hat pair is one where i ≤ j * K and j ≤ i * K. The code below incorrectly uses the modulo operator to check if i ≤ j * K and j ≤ i * K. This can lead to incorrect results.

```
def solve():
    L, R, K = map(int, input().split())
    print(1 if (R - L) % K == 0 else 0)


if __name__ == '__main__':

        solve()
```

The correct code should use the bitwise AND operator to check if i ≤ j * K and j ≤ i * K.

```
def solve():
    L, R, K = map(int, input().split())
    print(1 if (R & (R - 1)) == K else 0)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        solve()
```

**3. Incorrect use of conditional statements**

The problem statement states that a volatile grey hat pair is one where i ≤ j * K and j ≤ i * K. The code below incorrectly uses the conditional statement to check if i ≤ j * K and j ≤ i * K. This can lead to incorrect results.

```
def solve():
    L, R, K = map(int, input().split())
    if (R - L) % K == 0:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        solve()
```

The correct code should use the bitwise AND operator to check if i ≤ j * K and j ≤ i * K.

```
def solve():
    L, R, K = map(int, input().split())
    print(1 if (R & (R - 1)) == K else 0)

Title:
HACKEREARTH toss-ka-boss

Pain points:
Here are the most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrectly counting the number of times Dhoni won the toss.** This could happen if the developer does not properly track the number of consecutive wins or losses that Dhoni has experienced. For example, if the string "HHTTHTTHHH" is input, the developer could incorrectly count Dhoni's score as 11, because they would have counted the first two "H"s as two consecutive wins, and then the last three "H"s as three consecutive wins. The correct score is 10, because the first two "H"s are not consecutive wins, and the last three "H"s are not consecutive losses.
2. **Incorrectly calculating the number of points that Dhoni should earn in each round.** This could happen if the developer does not properly account for the fact that Dhoni's score is incremented by the number of times he has won the toss since the last time he lost. For example, if the string "HHTTHTTHHH" is input, the developer could incorrectly calculate Dhoni's score as 9, because they would have only counted the number of times that Dhoni won the toss in the current round. The correct score is 10, because Dhoni's score is incremented by 1 for each of the first two "H"s, and then by 2 for each of the last three "H"s.
3. **Incorrectly handling the case where Dhoni loses the toss multiple times in a row.** This could happen if the developer does not properly track the number of consecutive losses that Dhoni has experienced. For example, if the string "TTTTTTTTTTTTHT" is input, the developer could incorrectly count Dhoni's score as 0, because they would have only counted the number of times that Dhoni won the toss in the last round. The correct score is 1, because Dhoni's score is incremented by 1 for each of the first five "T"s, and then by 0 for each of the last six "T"s.
4. **Incorrectly handling the case where the string contains invalid characters.** This could happen if the developer does not properly validate the input string. For example, if the string "ABC123" is input, the developer could incorrectly crash the program or return an incorrect score. The correct way to handle this case is to raise an exception or return a default value.
5. **Incorrectly handling the case where the string is empty.** This could happen if the developer does not properly handle the case where the input string is empty. For example, if the string "" is input, the developer could incorrectly crash the program or return an incorrect score. The correct way to handle this case is to return 0.

    * Using the wrong type of data for the segment tree nodes.
    * Not initializing the segment tree nodes correctly.
    * Not updating the segment tree nodes correctly when performing queries.
    * Not using the segment tree in the correct way.

2. **Incorrect implementation of the queries.** The queries on the segment tree are also important to implement correctly. Some common mistakes include:
    * Using the wrong type of queries.
    * Not initializing the queries correctly.
    * Not updating the queries correctly when performing updates.
    * Not using the queries in the correct way.

3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** There are a number of edge cases that need to be handled when working with segment trees. Some common edge cases include:
    * Empty arrays.
    * Arrays with only one element.
    * Arrays with duplicate elements.
    * Arrays with negative elements.

4. **Incorrect use of the segment tree.** The segment tree is a powerful tool, but it is important to use it correctly in order to avoid bugs. Some common mistakes include:
    * Using the segment tree for problems that it is not well-suited for.
    * Using the segment tree in a way that is not efficient.
    * Using the segment tree in a way that is not correct.

5. **Failure to debug the code.** Even the most carefully written code can contain bugs. It is important to debug the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. Some common debugging techniques include:

Title:
ATCODER p02700 AtCoder Beginner Contest 164 - Battle

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is given in the format `A B C D`, where `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` are integers. If you accidentally use the wrong data type, such as a string, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input data and will likely crash.

**2. Not handling invalid input**

The input data may contain invalid values, such as negative integers or integers that are greater than 100. If you do not handle invalid input correctly, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

**3. Not considering all possible cases**

The problem statement states that the two monsters will take turns attacking, in the order Takahashi's, Aoki's, Takahashi's, Aoki's, ... However, your program may only consider the case where Takahashi's monster attacks first, or the case where Aoki's monster attacks first. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**4. Making a logical error**

The problem statement states that Takahashi will win if his monster's health is greater than or equal to 0 after the monsters have finished attacking. However, your program may incorrectly check if Takahashi's monster's health is greater than or equal to 1 after the monsters have finished attacking. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**5. Using inefficient algorithms**

The problem can be solved in O(1) time using a simple greedy algorithm. However, your program may use a more inefficient algorithm, such as a brute-force algorithm, which will result in a slow runtime.

Title:
ATCODER p02966 AtCoder Grand Contest 036 - Negative Cycle

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not specified clearly.**

The input format is not specified clearly. For example, it is not clear whether the first line of input is the number of vertices or the cost of an edge. This can lead to bugs in the code if the developer does not correctly parse the input.

**2. The problem statement is not clear.**

The problem statement is not clear. For example, it is not clear what is meant by "a negative cycle". This can lead to bugs in the code if the developer does not correctly understand the problem.

**3. The solution is not optimal.**

The solution is not optimal. For example, the solution does not take into account the fact that some edges may be more expensive to delete than others. This can lead to a sub-optimal solution.

**4. The code is not well-written.**

The code is not well-written. For example, the code is not modular and is difficult to read and understand. This can make it difficult to debug and maintain the code.

**5. The code is not tested.**

The code is not tested. This can lead to bugs that are not caught until the code is deployed in production. This can have serious consequences, such as data loss or system failure.

Title:
ATCODER p03101 AtCoder Beginner Contest 121 - White Cells

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect variable type**

The problem states that `H` and `W` are integers, but the developer may accidentally use a floating-point type. This would cause the program to produce incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect calculation**

The problem states that the number of white cells that will remain is `H * W - h * w`. The developer may accidentally calculate this incorrectly, for example by adding instead of subtracting. This would also cause the program to produce incorrect results.

**3. Off-by-one error**

The developer may accidentally count one row or column too many or too few. This would also cause the program to produce incorrect results.

**4. Undefined behavior**

The developer may attempt to access an element of an array outside of its bounds. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**5. Memory leak**

The developer may fail to free memory that is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

**6. Race condition**

The developer may attempt to access shared data from multiple threads without synchronization. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.

ATCODER p03565 AtCoder Beginner Contest 076 - Dubious Document 2

Pain points:
1. The input format is not clear. Is `S'` a substring of `S`?
2. The problem statement does not mention what to do if `S` does not contain `T` as a substring.
3. The problem statement does not mention what to do if `S'` does not contain all the characters in `T`.
4. The problem statement does not mention what to do if `S'` contains characters that are not in `T`.
5. The problem statement does not mention what to do if `S'` contains multiple occurrences of `?`.
Test inputs:
```
S = input()
T = input()

if len(T) > len(S):
    print("UNRESTORABLE")
    exit()

for i in range(len(S)):
    if S[i] == "?":
        if T[0] not in S:
            print("UNRESTORABLE")
            exit()
        S = S[:i] + T[0] + S[i + 1 :]

if S[:len(T)] != T:

This input is valid and should pass all the tests:

```
S = '?tc????'
T = 'coder'
```
Title:
ATCODER p03720 AtCoder Beginner Contest 061 - Counting Roads

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains two integers N and M, which represent the number of cities and roads, respectively. If you use the wrong data type to store these values, you may get a runtime error. For example, if you use a `char` to store N, you will get a runtime error when you try to access the 10th element of the array.

**2. Using the wrong index**

The output should be a list of N integers, where the i-th integer represents the number of roads connected to city i. If you use the wrong index to access the elements of the array, you will get the wrong answer. For example, if you try to access the 10th element of the array when N is 5, you will get the value of the 5th element.

**3. Not initializing the array**

Before you start using an array, you need to initialize it with the correct size. If you don't initialize the array, you may get a runtime error. For example, if you try to access the 10th element of an array that has only been initialized with 5 elements, you will get a runtime error.

**4. Using a for loop incorrectly**

The for loop is a very powerful tool, but it can be easy to use incorrectly. For example, if you forget to increment the loop variable, you will end up looping forever. Or, if you use the wrong condition in the for loop, you may not iterate over all of the elements of the array.

**5. Using the wrong data structure**

The problem asks you to count the number of roads connected to each city. A hash table is a good data structure for this problem because it allows you to quickly look up the number of roads connected to a given city. If you use a linked list or an array, you will not be able to access the data as quickly.

ATCODER p03880 CODE FESTIVAL 2016 Grand Final(Parallel) - Cheating Nim

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The cheater can win the game if he can leave the cheetah with a number of stones that is not divisible by 2. For example, if the cheater eats 1 stone from each pile of size 2, 3, and 4, the cheetah will be left with 1 stone, which is not divisible by 2.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The cheater can eat 1 stone from each pile of size 2, 3, and 4, but he cannot eat 1 stone from each pile of size 1. This is because the cheetah can then take all of the stones from the pile of size 1, leaving the cheater with a number of stones that is divisible by 2.
3. **Incorrect test cases.** The test cases should include examples where the cheater can win the game and examples where the cheater cannot win the game.
4. **Incorrect debugging.** If the solution is not correct, the developer should carefully debug the code to find the error. The developer should check for logical errors, such as incorrect assumptions about the input or incorrect implementation of the solution. The developer should also check for syntax errors, such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable types.

### 2. Incorrect output format

The output format is specified as follows:

```
Print the number of the sequences that contain an X,Y,Z-Haiku, modulo 10^9+7.
```

However, if the output format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the output is `1000000000`, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

### 3. Incorrect calculation

The program may incorrectly calculate the number of sequences that contain an X,Y,Z-Haiku. For example, the program may incorrectly calculate the number of sequences that contain an X,Y,Z-Haiku if the values of X, Y, and Z are not all distinct.

### 4. Integer overflow

The program may overflow if the values of X, Y, and Z are too large. For example, if the values of X, Y, and Z are all 10, the program may overflow.

### 5. Time complexity

The program may have a time complexity that is too high. For example, the program may have a time complexity of O(N^3), where N is the length of the input sequence.

### 6. Space complexity

The program may have a space complexity that is too high. For example, the program may have a space complexity of O(N^2), where N is the length of the input sequence.

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correct. For example, the input may not have the correct number of lines, or the values in the input may not be in the correct format.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correct. For example, the output may not be a single line, or the values in the output may not be in the correct format.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program may not be correct. For example, the program may not find the correct path for Pyonkichi to survive, or the program may not correctly handle all possible cases.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program may not free up memory that it has allocated. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
5. **Race conditions**. The program may not be thread-safe. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may have security vulnerabilities. For example, the program may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. **Use the correct input format**. Make sure that your program reads the input in the correct format. You can do this by using the `scanf()` function in C or the `input()` function in Python.
2. **Use the correct output format**. Make sure that your program outputs the results in the correct format. You can do this by using the `printf()` function in C or the `print()` function in Python.
3. **Write correct logic**. Make sure that your program correctly implements the algorithm for finding the path for Pyonkichi to survive. You can do this by carefully debugging your program and testing it with different inputs.
4. **Avoid memory leaks**. Make sure that your program frees up memory that it has allocated. You can do this by using the `free()` function in C or the `del()` function in Python.
5. **Avoid race conditions**. Make sure that your program is thread-safe. You can do this by using the `mutex` and `lock` functions in C or the `threading` module in Python.
6. **Fix security vulnerabilities**. Make sure that your program does not have any security vulnerabilities. You can do this by carefully reviewing your code and following secure coding practices.

Title:
AIZU p00632 Ghost Buster!

Pain points:
impossible
 0 0

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly implementing the ghost's movement algorithm.** The ghost's movement algorithm is fairly straightforward, but it is easy to make mistakes. For example, you might forget to check if the ghost is trying to move out of the grid, or you might not correctly handle the case where the ghost is trying to move into a square that is occupied by the girl.
* **Incorrectly implementing the algorithm for finding the earliest time and place where the girl and the ghost can meet.** This algorithm is more complex than the ghost's movement algorithm, and it is more likely to contain errors. For example, you might forget to consider all of the possible ways that the girl and the ghost can move, or you might not correctly handle the case where the girl and the ghost are already in the same square.
* **Using incorrect data types.** The input data is given in a text format, and it is important to correctly parse this data into the correct data types. For example, you might accidentally parse the height and width of the grid as strings, or you might accidentally parse the ghost's behavior pattern as a number.
* **Using incorrect variable names.** It is important to use clear and descriptive variable names so that your code is easy to read and understand. For example, you might use a variable name like `ghost_position` to store the ghost's current position, or you might use a variable name like `earliest_meeting_time` to store the earliest time when the girl and the ghost can meet.
* **Not using comments.** Comments are essential for making your code easy to read and understand. By adding comments, you can explain what your code is doing and why it is doing it. This will make it easier for other developers to understand your code and to debug any problems that might arise.
* **Not testing your code.** It is important to test your code to make sure that it is working correctly. You can test your code by running it on a variety of input data and checking the output. This will help you to identify any bugs in your code and to fix them before they cause problems in production.

Title:
AIZU p00776 Encryption System

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input contains a string that is not a lowercase letter, the program may not be able to process it correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to produce incorrect results. For example, if the output does not contain the correct number of candidates, the program may not be able to decode the original string correctly.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to decode the original string may be incorrect. For example, if the algorithm does not take into account all of the possible ways to encrypt a string, the program may not be able to decode all of the candidates correctly.
4. **Incorrect data structures**. The data structures used to store the candidates may be incorrect. For example, if the data structures are not able to handle all of the possible candidates, the program may not be able to decode all of the candidates correctly.
5. **Incorrect implementation**. The implementation of the program may be incorrect. For example, if the program contains errors in the logic or the code, the program may not be able to decode the original string correctly.

Title:
AIZU p01791 Card Game Strategy

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly specified, so it is possible that the developer will misinterpret the input and make mistakes. For example, the input could be in the form of a list of numbers, or it could be in the form of a string of characters. The developer must be careful to parse the input correctly and to ensure that it is in the correct format.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the winning score.** The winning score is calculated by adding the values of the cards in the player's hand. However, it is possible that the developer will make a mistake in this calculation, such as adding the values of the cards incorrectly or forgetting to add a card to the total. The developer must be careful to ensure that the winning score is calculated correctly.
3. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not strictly specified, so it is possible that the developer will misinterpret the output and make mistakes. For example, the output could be in the form of a list of numbers, or it could be in the form of a string of characters. The developer must be careful to format the output correctly.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when the developer accidentally counts one number too many or one number too few. This type of error can be difficult to find, as it can often be masked by other errors in the code. The developer must be careful to check for off-by-one errors in their code.
5. **Logic errors.** Logic errors are a type of error that occurs when the developer makes a mistake in the logic of their code. This type of error can be difficult to find, as it can often be caused by a misunderstanding of the problem. The developer must be careful to ensure that the logic of their code is correct.

Title:
AIZU p01926 Game Balance

Pain points:
**1. Input data may be invalid.**

The input data may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers greater than 1,000,000. The program should handle these invalid values gracefully.

**2. The game may not be winnable.**

It is possible that the game cannot be won, no matter how the parameter X is set. For example, if the strongest enemy monster has a strength of 1,000,000 and the minimum number of battles required to clear the game is 2, then it is impossible to win the game even if X is set to 1,000,000. The program should handle this case gracefully.

**3. The program may not terminate.**

The program should terminate after it has printed the output for all of the input data. The program should not run indefinitely.

**4. The program may not be efficient.**

The program should be efficient enough to run on a reasonable amount of time. The program should not take hours or days to run.
