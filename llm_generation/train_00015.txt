CODECHEF aehash

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect modulo operation**

When calculating the hash value of a binary string, it is important to use the correct modulo operation. In this problem, the modulo operation should be performed using 1000000007. If a different modulo operation is used, the results will be incorrect.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm to split a binary string**

The function split in the pseudocode for the hash function takes a binary string as the parameter and returns a pair of binary strings (S1, S2) such that:

* |S1| <= |S2|.
* The difference of |S1| and |S2| is at most 1.
* The concatenation of S1 and S2 (in that order) is S.

If an incorrect algorithm is used to split a binary string, the results will be incorrect.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm to count the number of binary strings with a given hash value**

The number of binary strings with a given hash value can be calculated using dynamic programming. However, if an incorrect algorithm is used, the results will be incorrect.

**4. Using an incorrect modulo operation when counting the number of binary strings**

When counting the number of binary strings with a given hash value, it is important to use the correct modulo operation. In this problem, the modulo operation should be performed using 1000000007. If a different modulo operation is used, the results will be incorrect.

Title:
CODECHEF chefsqua

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not clear.** The problem statement does not specify the input format. It is not clear whether the input is a list of points, or a list of pairs of coordinates.
2. **The output format is not clear.** The problem statement does not specify the output format. It is not clear whether the output should be a number, or a list of points.
3. **The problem is not well-defined.** The problem statement does not specify what it means for a set of points to form a square. Is it sufficient for the points to be colinear? Or do they need to be arranged in a specific order?
4. **The problem is too easy.** The problem can be solved by brute force, by simply trying all possible combinations of points.
5. **The problem is too hard.** The problem is NP-hard, and there is no known polynomial-time algorithm to solve it.

Here are some suggestions for how to avoid these problems:

1. **Use a clear and concise input format.** The input format should be easy to understand, and it should be unambiguous. For example, the input could be a list of points, where each point is represented by a pair of coordinates.
2. **Use a clear and concise output format.** The output format should be easy to understand, and it should be unambiguous. For example, the output could be a number, representing the number of points that need to be added to the set in order to form a square.
3. **Define the problem precisely.** The problem statement should clearly define what it means for a set of points to form a square. For example, the points must be colinear, and they must be arranged in a specific order.
4. **Make the problem challenging, but not too easy or too hard.** The problem should be challenging enough to be interesting, but it should not be so difficult that it is impossible to solve.
5. **Use a known algorithm to solve the problem.** If there is a known polynomial-time algorithm to solve the problem, then use that algorithm. If there is no known polynomial-time algorithm to solve the problem, then either provide a heuristic solution or state that the problem is NP-hard.

Title:
CODECHEF drctnsrm

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of global variables.** In the following code, `curr_dir` is a global variable that is used to track the current direction. However, it is not initialized before being used in the `get_next_dir()` function. This can lead to incorrect results if the function is called before `curr_dir` has been initialized.

```python
def get_next_dir(curr_dir, next_move):
  """Gets the next direction based on the current direction and the next move.

  Args:
    curr_dir: The current direction.
    next_move: The next move.

  Returns:
    The next direction.
  """

  # Check if the next move is valid.

  if next_move not in ["N", "S", "E", "W"]:
    raise ValueError("Invalid move: %s" % next_move)

  # Get the next direction based on the current direction and the next move.

  if curr_dir == "N":
    if next_move == "E":
      return "NORTHEAST"
    elif next_move == "W":
      return "NORTHWEST"
  elif curr_dir == "S":
    if next_move == "E":
      return "SOUTHEAST"
    elif next_move == "W":
      return "SOUTHWEST"
  elif curr_dir == "E":
    if next_move == "N":
      return "NORTHEAST"
    elif next_move == "S":
      return "SOUTHEAST"
  elif curr_dir == "W":
    if next_move == "N":
      return "NORTHWEST"
    elif next_move == "S":
      return "SOUTHWEST"

  # The next move is invalid.

  raise ValueError("Invalid move: %s" % next_move)
```

2. **Incorrect use of `break` statements.** In the following code, the `break` statement in the `get_next_dir()` function is used to exit the function early if the next move is invalid. However, this can lead to incorrect results if the next move is valid but the function is called with an invalid current direction.

```python
def get_next_dir(curr_dir, next_move):
  """Gets the next direction based on the current direction and the next move.

  Args:
    curr_dir: The current direction.
    next_move: The next move.

  Returns:
    The next direction.
  """

  # Check if the next move is valid.

  if next_move not in ["N", "S", "E", "W"]:
    raise ValueError("Invalid move: %s" % next_move)

  # Get the next direction based on the current direction and the next move.

  if curr_dir == "N":
    if next_move == "E":
      return "NORTHEAST"
    elif next_move == "W":
      return "NORTHWEST"
  elif curr_dir == "S":
    if next_move == "E":
      return "SOUTHEAST"
    elif next_move == "W":
      return "SOUTHWEST"
  elif curr_dir == "E":
    if next_move == "N":
      return "NORTHEAST"
    elif next_move == "S":
      return "SOUTHEAST"
  elif curr_dir == "W":
    if next_move == "N":
      return "NORTHWEST"
    elif next_move == "S":
      return "SOUTHWEST"

  # The next move is invalid.

  break
```

3. **Incorrect use of `continue` statements.** In the following code, the `continue` statement in the `get_next_dir()` function is used to skip the current iteration of the loop if the next move is invalid. However, this can lead to incorrect results if the next move is valid but the current direction is invalid.

```python
def get_next_dir(curr_dir, next_move):
  """Gets the next direction based on the current direction and the next move.

  Args:
    curr_dir: The current direction.
    next_move: The next move.

CODECHEF numbers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or a name that is too long. The developer should check the input format and raise an error if it is incorrect.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correctly followed. For example, the output may not contain a single line, or it may contain a line that is not a valid name or number. The developer should check the output format and raise an error if it is incorrect.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may implement the logic incorrectly, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the developer may not consider all possible cases, or may make a mistake in the calculations. The developer should carefully check the logic to ensure that it is correct.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer may not release memory that is no longer needed, resulting in a memory leak. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash. The developer should use a memory management tool to track memory usage and identify any memory leaks.
5. **Synchronization issues**. The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data, resulting in data corruption or deadlocks. The developer should use locks or other synchronization mechanisms to ensure that only one thread can access shared data at a time.
6. **Race conditions**. The developer may not properly handle race conditions, resulting in incorrect results. A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access shared data at the same time and the order in which the threads access the data affects the results. The developer should use locks or other synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions.
7. **Deadlocks**. The developer may not properly handle deadlocks, resulting in the program being unable to continue execution. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, and none of the threads can continue until the other thread releases the lock. The developer should use locks or other synchronization mechanisms to prevent deadlocks.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer may not properly implement security measures, resulting in a security vulnerability. For example, the developer may not properly validate input, resulting in a malicious user being able to inject code into the program. The developer should carefully implement security measures to protect the program from malicious users.

CODEFORCES 1092_D1. Great Vova Wall (Version 1)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect variable declaration**. The variables used in the program must be declared correctly, or the program will not work properly. For example, if a variable is declared as a string when it should be an integer, the program will not be able to perform mathematical operations on it.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be correct, or the program will not produce the correct output. For example, if the program is supposed to find the maximum value in an array, but it instead finds the minimum value, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the programmer miscounts by one. For example, if the programmer is supposed to iterate over an array from 0 to n, but they instead iterate from 0 to n-1, the program will not work correctly.
5. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when the programmer allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results or crashing.
7. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, but neither thread can do so. This can lead to the program running indefinitely or crashing.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid common problems and bugs when solving programming problems.

5. **Memory complexity.** The solution may use too much memory. For example, the solution may create a large array to store all of the possible values of i and j.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test your solution thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly for all possible inputs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1217_B. Zmei Gorynich

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of heads Zmei initially has is not a positive integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program. For example, if the minimum number of blows to defeat Zmei Gorynich is not an integer, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of blows**. The minimum number of blows to defeat Zmei Gorynich may not be calculated correctly, which may lead to the program giving an incorrect answer. For example, if the number of heads Zmei initially has is greater than the total number of blows available, the program will incorrectly output that Zmei Gorynich can be defeated.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. The problem may have edge cases that are not handled correctly by the program, which may lead to errors. For example, if the number of heads Zmei initially has is zero, the program will crash.
5. **Incorrect use of data structures**. The program may use data structures incorrectly, which may lead to errors. For example, if the program uses a hash table to store the number of heads Zmei has after each blow, the program will crash if the number of heads Zmei has is greater than the maximum size of the hash table.
6. **Incorrect use of algorithms**. The program may use algorithms incorrectly, which may lead to errors. For example, if the program uses a brute-force algorithm to find the minimum number of blows to defeat Zmei Gorynich, the program will run very slowly.
7. **Incorrect debugging**. The program may not be debugged correctly, which may lead to errors. For example, the program may not check for all possible errors, or the program may not use the correct debugging tools.

CODEFORCES 123_D. String

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not specified clearly in the problem statement. Make sure to read the problem statement carefully and understand the input format. For example, in this problem, the input is a string. If you accidentally read the input as an integer, you will get a runtime error.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not specified clearly in the problem statement. Make sure to read the problem statement carefully and understand the output format. For example, in this problem, the output is an integer. If you accidentally print a string, you will get a runtime error.

**3. Incorrect calculation**

The most common mistake is to make a mistake in the calculation. Make sure to carefully check your calculations. For example, in this problem, you need to calculate the sum of F(s, x) for all x that are substrings of s. If you accidentally calculate the sum of F(s, x) for all x, you will get the wrong answer.

**4. Runtime error**

Make sure to check for runtime errors. For example, in this problem, you need to sort the list of pairs of numbers according to the pair's first number's increasing. If you accidentally sort the list by the pair's second number, you will get a runtime error.

**5. Memory error**

Make sure to check for memory errors. For example, in this problem, you need to create a list of pairs of numbers. If you accidentally create a list that is too large, you will get a memory error.

CODEFORCES 1282_A. Temporarily unavailable

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a negative number of test cases, or the input may contain a test case with more than four integers.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may not contain the correct number of test cases, or the output may contain a non-integer number.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the answer.** The answer may be incorrect because the developer made a mistake in the calculation. For example, the developer may have forgotten to account for the fact that Polycarp's speed is one unit of distance per minute, or the developer may have made a mistake in calculating the distance between Polycarp and the base station.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The developer may have made a mistake in handling edge cases, such as the case where Polycarp starts or ends his journey at the base station, or the case where the base station is located outside of Polycarp's path.
5. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The developer may have made a mistake in using data structures, such as using a list to store the test cases instead of a queue.
6. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** The developer may have made a mistake in using algorithms, such as using a brute-force algorithm to find the answer instead of a more efficient algorithm.
7. **Incorrect error handling.** The developer may have made a mistake in handling errors, such as not handling the case where the input file does not exist.

Pain points:
### Possible problems and bugs ###

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make mistakes. For example, you might forget to add a space between two numbers, or you might use the wrong character to represent a color.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is easy to make mistakes. For example, you might forget to add a newline character at the end of your output, or you might use the wrong character to represent a color.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program is the most important part, and it is easy to make mistakes here. For example, you might forget to check for a specific condition, or you might use the wrong algorithm.
4. **Memory leaks**. If you are not careful, your program could leak memory. This can cause your program to crash or run slowly.
5. **Security vulnerabilities**. If you are not careful, your program could be vulnerable to security attacks. For example, your program could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on your computer.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. You should also carefully write your code and test it thoroughly.

CODEFORCES 1366_F. Jog Around The Graph

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that computes the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. It is often used to solve problems such as finding the shortest path between two vertices in a graph or finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph.
2. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) is used to find the remainder of a division operation. It is important to use the modulo operator correctly, as using it incorrectly can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of mistake that can occur when programming. They occur when a programmer forgets to account for the first or last element in a list or array. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** Edge cases are special cases that need to be handled differently from the normal case. Failure to handle edge cases correctly can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Memory leaks.** Memory leaks occur when a programmer allocates memory but does not release it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to a program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Synchronization errors.** Synchronization errors occur when multiple threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even a program crash.
7. **Race conditions.** Race conditions occur when the outcome of a program depends on the order in which two or more threads execute. This can lead to incorrect results or even a program crash.
8. **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, and neither thread can continue until the other thread releases the resource. This can lead to a program being stuck in an infinite loop.
9. **Uncaught exceptions.** Uncaught exceptions occur when a program encounters an error that it cannot handle. This can lead to a program crashing or behaving in an unexpected way.
10. **Security vulnerabilities.** Security vulnerabilities are weaknesses in a program that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to a system. Security vulnerabilities can be caused by a variety of factors, including incorrect implementation of security features, improper use of security controls, and failure to follow security best practices.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1408_F. Two Different

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for `n`.** The input `n` is an integer, so it should be stored as an `int`. If you store it as a `long`, `float`, or `double`, you may get incorrect results.
2. **Using the wrong data type for `x` and `y`.** The input `x` and `y` are integers, so they should be stored as `int`s. If you store them as `long`, `float`, or `double`, you may get incorrect results.
3. **Using the wrong data type for `t`.** The temporary variable `t` is used to store the value of `f(a_x, a_y)`. Since `f(a_x, a_y)` is an integer, `t` should also be an `int`. If you store it as a `long`, `float`, or `double`, you may get incorrect results.
4. **Using the wrong algorithm to find the pairs of integers.** The problem statement states that there should be at most two different numbers in the array `a` after performing all of the operations. This means that we can use a greedy algorithm to find the pairs of integers. A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that makes the best possible choice at each step, without considering the future. In this case, the best possible choice is to always choose the pair of integers that results in the smallest possible value of `t`.
5. **Not handling the case where `n` is equal to 1.** The problem statement does not explicitly state what to do if `n` is equal to 1. However, we can infer from the problem statement that we should not perform any operations in this case. This is because the array `a` will already have at most two different numbers after performing no operations.
6. **Not handling the case where `x` and `y` are equal.** The problem statement does not explicitly state what to do if `x` and `y` are equal. However, we can infer from the problem statement that we should not perform any operations in this case. This is because the value of `f(a_x, a_y)` will be the same as the value of `a_x`, and therefore will not result in any change to the array `a`.
7. **Not handling the case where `f(a_x, a_y)` is equal to `a_x` or `a_y`.** The problem statement does not explicitly state what to do if `f(a_x, a_y)` is equal to `a_x` or `a_y`. However, we can infer from the problem statement that we should not perform any operations in this case. This is because the value of `f(a_x, a_y)` will be the same as the value of `a_x` or `a_y`, and therefore will not result in any change to the array `a`.
8. **Not handling the case where `f(a_x, a_y)` is equal to `0`.** The problem statement does not explicitly state what to do if `f(a_x, a_y)` is equal to `0`. However, we can infer from the problem statement that we should not perform any operations in this case. This is because the value of `f(a_x, a_y)` will be the same as the value of `0`, and therefore will not result in any change to the array `a`.

CODEFORCES 1428_H. Rotary Laser Lock

Pain points:
**Possible problems:**

* **Incorrect input format.** The input format is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading it. For example, you might forget to put a space between two numbers, or you might put the numbers in the wrong order. This can cause the program to crash or give incorrect results.
* **Incorrect output format.** The output format is also very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when writing it. For example, you might forget to put a newline character at the end of the line, or you might put the numbers in the wrong order. This can cause the program to crash or give incorrect results.
* **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program is very complex, and it is easy to make a mistake. For example, you might forget to update a variable when it should be updated, or you might use the wrong variable. This can cause the program to crash or give incorrect results.
* **Memory leaks.** The program may allocate memory that it does not free, which can eventually lead to a memory leak. This can cause the program to crash or run out of memory.
* **Race conditions.** The program may access shared data without locking it, which can lead to a race condition. This can cause the program to crash or give incorrect results.
* **Deadlocks.** The program may enter a deadlock, where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, which can prevent the program from making any progress. This can cause the program to hang or crash.

**Possible bugs:**

* **The program may crash if the input format is incorrect.** For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, or if the input is not in the correct order, the program may crash.
* **The program may give incorrect results if the output format is incorrect.** For example, if the output does not contain the correct number of numbers, or if the numbers are not in the correct order, the program may give incorrect results.
* **The program may not work correctly if the logic is incorrect.** For example, if the program does not update a variable when it should be updated, or if the program uses the wrong variable, the program may not work correctly.
* **The program may leak memory if it does not free memory that it allocates.** This can eventually lead to a memory leak, which can cause the program to crash or run out of memory.
* **The program may experience a race condition if it accesses shared data without locking it.** This can cause the program to crash or give incorrect results.

CODEFORCES 1452_D. Radio Towers

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving problems. It is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the exact requirements. Then, you need to implement the algorithm correctly, paying attention to all the details.
2. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The data structures that you use to store and process data can have a significant impact on the performance of your program. It is important to choose the right data structures for the problem you are solving.
3. **Incorrect use of mathematical formulas.** When solving mathematical problems, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct formulas. A small mistake in a formula can lead to a large error in the final result.
4. **Incorrect error handling.** It is important to handle errors in your program correctly. If an error occurs, your program should either gracefully terminate or print an informative error message.
5. **Incorrect testing.** It is important to test your program thoroughly before submitting it. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that developers may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** One common mistake that developers make is to incorrectly implement the algorithm for finding the probability that all constraints are met. For example, they may forget to take into account the fact that the towers are built in the towns 1, 2, ..., n with probability 1/2.
* **Incorrect use of data structures.** Another common mistake that developers make is to incorrectly use data structures to store and process data. For example, they may use a list to store the signal powers of the towers, when they should actually be using a set.
* **Incorrect use of mathematical formulas.** A third common mistake that developers make is to incorrectly use mathematical formulas. For example, they may forget to multiply the probability that the towers are built in towns 1, 2, ..., n by the probability that the signal powers of the towers can be set so that all constraints are met.
* **Incorrect error handling.** A fourth common mistake that developers make is to incorrectly handle errors in their program. For example, they may not handle the case where the input is not a valid integer.
* **Incorrect testing.** A fifth common mistake that developers make is to incorrectly test their program. For example, they may only test their program on small inputs, when they should also test it on large inputs.

CODEFORCES 1476_B. Inflation

Pain points:
 3. (1)/(1 + 1 + 1) ≤ 100/100;  **1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input data. For example, if you forget to add a space between two integers, the code will not work correctly.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the inflation coefficients**

The inflation coefficients are calculated as the ratio of the current price increase to the price at the start of this month. It is important to make sure that the price at the start of each month is calculated correctly.

**3. Incorrect rounding of the inflation coefficients**

The inflation coefficients must be rounded to the nearest integer. It is important to make sure that the rounding is done correctly.

**4. Incorrect calculation of the minimum total sum of changes**

The minimum total sum of changes is the sum of the absolute values of the differences between the original price increases and the price increases that make the inflation coefficients not more than k%. It is important to make sure that the calculation is done correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 296_D. Greg and Graph

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input format is incorrect, the program may not be able to correctly identify the number of vertices in the graph, which could lead to incorrect results.
* **Incorrect graph representation:** The graph is not correctly represented, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the graph is not represented as an adjacency matrix, the program may not be able to correctly calculate the shortest paths between vertices, which could lead to incorrect results.
* **Incorrect shortest path calculation:** The shortest paths between vertices are not correctly calculated, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program uses a Dijkstra algorithm to calculate the shortest paths, but the graph contains negative-weight edges, the program may not be able to correctly calculate the shortest paths, which could lead to incorrect results.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correctly generated, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the output format is incorrect, the program may not be able to correctly print the sum of the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices, which could lead to incorrect results.

**Additional tips:**

* To avoid incorrect input format, make sure to correctly parse the input data. For example, use the `scanf()` function to read the input data into a buffer, and then use the `sscanf()` function to parse the data into the appropriate variables.
* To avoid incorrect graph representation, make sure to correctly represent the graph data. For example, if the graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, make sure to correctly initialize the matrix with zeros.
* To avoid incorrect shortest path calculation, make sure to use an appropriate algorithm to calculate the shortest paths. For example, if the graph contains negative-weight edges, use the Bellman-Ford algorithm instead of the Dijkstra algorithm.
* To avoid incorrect output format, make sure to correctly format the output data. For example, use the `printf()` function to print the output data in the correct format.

CODEFORCES 38_H. The Great Marathon

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, you might accidentally read the number of cities as the number of roads, or you might forget to read the last line of input. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
2. **Incorrect data structures.** The data structures you use to represent the graph and the medals can have a big impact on the performance of your program. For example, if you use a linked list to represent the graph, it will be much slower than using an adjacency list. Similarly, if you use a hash table to represent the medals, it will be much faster than using a sorted array.
3. **Incorrect algorithms.** The algorithms you use to solve this problem can also have a big impact on the performance of your program. For example, the naive algorithm for finding all the paths from one vertex to another in a graph is very inefficient. There are more efficient algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, that can be used instead.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that can occur when you're working with arrays or lists. For example, you might accidentally index an array one element out of bounds, or you might forget to add one to a counter. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
5. **Memory leaks.** Memory leaks can occur when you allocate memory for a variable and then forget to free it when you're done with it. This can eventually lead to your program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Synchronization errors.** Synchronization errors can occur when multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time. This can lead to data corruption or the program crashing.
7. **Race conditions.** Race conditions can occur when two threads are trying to access the same data at the same time, and the outcome of the program depends on the order in which the threads access the data. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.

By being aware of these potential problems, you can avoid them and write code that is correct, efficient, and free of bugs.

CODEFORCES 721_B. Passwords

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is:

```
n k
p1
p2
...
pn
password
```

where `n` and `k` are integers, and `p1`, `p2`, ..., `pn` and `password` are strings.

However, a common mistake is to forget the space between `n` and `k`. This will cause the program to crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is:

```
best_case
worst_case
```

where `best_case` and `worst_case` are integers.

A common mistake is to forget the space between `best_case` and `worst_case`. This will cause the program to output an incorrect answer.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When iterating through the list of passwords, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, you might accidentally iterate over the list of passwords one element too many or one element too few. This can lead to incorrect results.

**4. Using the wrong data type**

The input and output for this problem are all strings. However, it is easy to accidentally use the wrong data type, such as an integer or a float. This can lead to incorrect results.

**5. Not handling edge cases**

There are a few edge cases that you need to be aware of when solving this problem. For example, what happens if the list of passwords is empty? What happens if the user enters the wrong password more than `k` times? You need to make sure that your program handles these edge cases correctly.

CODEFORCES 835_F. Roads in the Kingdom

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always followed correctly, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of towns is not a positive integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The data type of the input values must be correct. For example, if the number of towns is a string instead of an integer, the program will crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors occur when the programmer forgets to add or subtract one from a value. For example, if the program is supposed to find the minimum of two numbers, but the programmer accidentally subtracts one from the first number, the wrong minimum will be found.
4. **Logic errors.** Logic errors occur when the programmer makes a mistake in the logic of the program. For example, if the program is supposed to find the shortest distance between two points, but the programmer accidentally uses the wrong formula, the wrong distance will be found.
5. **Memory leaks.** Memory leaks occur when the programmer does not free up memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions.** Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results or crashing.
7. **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can lead to the program being stuck and unable to continue.

CODEFORCES 856_B. Similar Words

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may contain non-integer values, such as strings or characters. This can lead to errors in the program's logic and incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect assumptions**. The developer may make incorrect assumptions about the input data, such as assuming that all words are of the same length or that they are all unique. This can lead to errors in the program's logic and incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect implementation**. The developer may implement the program incorrectly, such as using the wrong data structures or algorithms. This can lead to errors in the program's logic and incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect testing**. The developer may not test the program thoroughly enough, which can lead to errors that are not caught until the program is deployed in production. This can lead to serious problems, such as data loss or security breaches.
5. **Incorrect deployment**. The developer may deploy the program incorrectly, such as to a production environment that is not ready for it. This can lead to errors that can affect users or cause the program to crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 883_B. Berland Army

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not strictly defined. For example, the input `5 3 3 0 3 0 0 2` is incorrect because there is an extra space between the first two numbers.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is also not strictly defined. For example, the output `1 3 3 2 2` is incorrect because it contains an extra space between the first two numbers.

**3. Undefined behavior**

The problem does not specify what happens if there are no military men with a given rank. For example, if the input is `5 3 3 0 3 0 0 2`, the output `1 3 3 2 2` is undefined because it does not assign a rank to the military man with index 5.

**4. Inefficient solution**

The naive solution to this problem is to iterate over all possible assignments of ranks to the military men and check if each order is satisfied. This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2m), which is too slow for large inputs.

**5. Incorrect solution**

The solution may be incorrect if it does not satisfy all of the constraints in the problem statement. For example, the solution `1 2 3 4 5` is incorrect for the input `5 3 3 0 3 0 0 2` because it does not satisfy the constraint that each rank from 1 to k must be assigned to at least one military man.

**6. Unclear solution**

The solution may be unclear if it is not easy to understand how it works. For example, the solution `1 2 3 4 5` is unclear because it does not explain why it is correct.

**7. Incomplete solution**

The solution may be incomplete if it does not solve the problem completely. For example, the solution `1 2 3 4 5` is incomplete for the input `5 3 3 0 3 0 0 2` because it does not assign a rank to the military man with index 5.

CODEFORCES 906_B. Seating of Students

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or the number of rows and columns may be negative.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may not contain two integers, or the numbers may not be separated by a space.
3. **Incorrect solution**. The solution may not find a valid seating arrangement that satisfies the constraints of the problem. For example, the solution may not ensure that no two students are adjacent in the new seating arrangement.
4. **Time complexity**. The solution may not run in time that is polynomial in the size of the input. For example, the solution may use a brute-force approach that enumerates all possible seating arrangements.
5. **Space complexity**. The solution may not use space that is polynomial in the size of the input. For example, the solution may create a table of all possible seating arrangements.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to design a solution that is correct, efficient, and uses as little space as possible.

CODEFORCES 926_D. Choose Place

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrectly identifying the most convenient place.** The most convenient place is the one that is closest to the blackboard. However, a developer may incorrectly identify the most convenient place as the one that is furthest from the blackboard. This can be avoided by carefully reading the problem statement and understanding the definition of "convenience".
2. **Not considering all possible solutions.** There may be multiple solutions to the problem. A developer may only consider one solution and miss out on the other solutions. This can be avoided by exhaustively searching all possible solutions.
3. **Incorrectly implementing the solution.** The solution may be incorrect due to a programming error. This can be avoided by carefully writing and debugging the code.
4. **Not handling all edge cases.** The problem may have edge cases that are not explicitly mentioned in the problem statement. A developer may not handle these edge cases correctly, which can lead to incorrect results. This can be avoided by carefully considering all possible edge cases.
5. **Not meeting the performance requirements.** The solution may not meet the performance requirements of the problem. This can be avoided by using efficient algorithms and data structures.

**Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* A developer may incorrectly identify the most convenient place as the one that is furthest from the blackboard. For example, in the input ```
..-**-..
..-**-..
..-..-..
..-..-..
..-..-..
..-..-..
```
the most convenient place is the one in the first row, second column. However, a developer may incorrectly identify the most convenient place as the one in the sixth row, first column. This is because the developer does not understand the definition of "convenience".
* A developer may only consider one solution to the problem. For example, in the input ```
**-**-**
**-**-**
..-**-.*
**-**-**
..-..-..
..-**-..
```
there are two solutions to the problem:
    * Put Petya in the first row, second column.
    * Put Petya in the second row, second column.
A developer may only consider the first solution and miss out on the second solution. This can be avoided by exhaustively searching all possible solutions.
* A developer may incorrectly implement the solution. For example, in the input ```
..-**-..
..-**-..
..-..-..
..-..-..
..-..-..
..-..-..
```
the solution is to put Petya in the first row, second column. However, a developer may incorrectly implement the solution by putting Petya in the first row, first column. This is because the developer does not correctly understand the input format.
* A developer may not handle all edge cases. For example, in the input ```
**-**-**
**-**-**
..-**-.*
**-**-**
..-..-..
..-**-..
```
the solution is to put Petya in the first row, second column. However, a developer may not handle the case where the first row is full. This can lead to incorrect results.
* A developer may not meet the performance requirements. For example, the input ```
**********
**********
**********
**********
**********
**********
```
has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of rows. This is not efficient enough for large values of n. A developer can improve the performance by using a more efficient algorithm.

HACKEREARTH 2a-bear-and-all-permutations-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modular arithmetic**.
    When computing the modular inverse of a number, it is important to make sure that the inverse exists. For example, the modular inverse of 5 modulo 3 does not exist, so computing `5 ^ (-1) % 3` will result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Off-by-one errors**.
    When iterating over a range of numbers, it is important to make sure that you start and end at the correct indices. For example, if you are iterating over the numbers from 1 to 10, you should start at `i = 1` and end at `i = 10`.
3. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic**.
    When computing the remainder of a division, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct modulus. For example, if you are computing the remainder of `10 / 3`, you should use the modulus `3`.
4. **Incorrect use of exponentiation**.
    When computing the exponentiation of a number, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct base and exponent. For example, if you are computing `2 ^ 3`, you should use the base `2` and the exponent `3`.
5. **Incorrect use of factorials**.
    When computing the factorial of a number, it is important to make sure that the number is non-negative. For example, the factorial of `-1` does not exist.

HACKEREARTH big-p-and-math-15

Pain points:
1. The input may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers that are too large. The developer should check the input for validity and handle errors appropriately.
2. The developer may incorrectly calculate the minimum and maximum sums. For example, they may forget to consider the possibility that Big P could write a '6' as a '5' and vice versa.
3. The developer may incorrectly format the output. The output should be two space-separated integers, representing the minimum and maximum sums Big P could get.
4. The developer may not be familiar with the Python programming language. They may make mistakes such as using the wrong data types or not using the correct syntax.
5. The developer may not be able to solve the problem efficiently. They may use a brute-force approach that takes a long time to run.

Title:
HACKEREARTH count-numbers-7

Pain points:
1. **Not handling the input correctly**. The input may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or non-integers. The developer should make sure to handle these cases correctly.
2. **Using an incorrect algorithm**. The naive algorithm for this problem would be to iterate over all the numbers between Ai and Bi and check if each one is divisible by any of the K primes. This would be very inefficient, as it would require O(K * N) time, where N is the number of numbers between Ai and Bi. A more efficient algorithm would be to use a sieve of Eratosthenes to precompute a list of all the numbers that are divisible by any of the K primes. This would allow the developer to check if a number is divisible by any of the K primes in O(1) time.
3. **Not handling overflows**. The numbers in the input may be very large, and the developer should make sure to use the correct data types to avoid overflows.
4. **Not handling errors correctly**. The program may encounter errors, such as invalid input or out-of-memory errors. The developer should make sure to handle these errors correctly.
5. **Not testing the program thoroughly**. The developer should test the program thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly for all possible inputs. This includes testing for invalid input, edge cases, and different data types.

HACKEREARTH interesting-path

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not correct. For example, if the input is `10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`, the program will throw an error because the first element of the input is not an integer.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not correct. For example, if the input is `10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`, the program will output `10`, which is not the correct answer.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm is incorrect. For example, the following algorithm is incorrect:

```
def get_min_jumps(nums):
  """
  Get the minimum number of jumps required to reach the end of the path.

  Args:
    nums: A list of numbers representing the maximum jump length that can be made by the person standing on that rock.

  Returns:
    The minimum number of jumps required to reach the end of the path.
  """

  # Initialize the min_jumps variable to the length of the list.

  min_jumps = len(nums)

  # Iterate over the list of numbers.

  for i in range(len(nums)):
    # If the current number is greater than the min_jumps variable, update the min_jumps variable.

    if nums[i] > min_jumps:
      min_jumps = nums[i]

  return min_jumps
```

This algorithm is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the person can only jump to the next rock or the rock that is two rocks away.

**4. Incorrect data structures**

The data structures used in the program are incorrect. For example, if the input is `10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`, the program will use a list to store the numbers in the input. However, this is incorrect because the list will not be able to store the numbers in the correct order.

**5. Incorrect error handling**

The program does not handle errors correctly. For example, if the input is `10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`, the program will not handle the error that occurs when the first element of the input is not an integer.

**6. Incorrect unit tests**

The unit tests for the program are incorrect. For example, the unit tests do not test the case where the input is incorrect.
Test inputs:
1. Incorrect input format

3. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum prize**. The maximum prize is the sum of the k largest elements in the array, not the sum of the first k elements.
4. **Memory leak**. The array of game prizes should be declared as a local variable, not a global variable.
5. **Incorrect use of the `max()` function**. The `max()` function should be used to compare two elements, not to compare an element to a constant.
6. **Incorrect use of the `sort()` function**. The `sort()` function should be used to sort the array of game prizes in descending order, not in ascending order.

HACKEREARTH optimal-permutation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input `N` is a natural number, so it should be an integer. However, the code below uses a float variable to store `N`. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The code below computes the sum of the absolute differences of all the consecutive elements of the permutation. However, it does not include the last element in the sum. This can lead to an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code below assumes that the optimal permutation is always the one that maximizes the sum of the absolute differences of all the consecutive elements. However, this is not always the case. For example, for `N = 3`, the optimal permutation is `{3, 1, 2}`, which has a sum of absolute differences of `6`. However, the permutation `{1, 2, 3}` also has a sum of absolute differences of `6`, but it is not optimal.
4. **Unnecessary computation**. The code below computes the sum of the absolute differences of all the consecutive elements of the permutation twice. This is unnecessary and can lead to a performance penalty.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def optimal_permutation(n):
  """

Title:
HACKEREARTH small-is-cute

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input integers can be very large, so it is important to use the correct data type to store them. Using a data type that is too small can lead to overflow errors, which will cause the program to crash.

**2. Not handling negative integers correctly**

The problem statement specifies that the input integers must be positive. However, it is possible for a user to accidentally enter a negative integer. If this happens, the program should handle the error gracefully and output an appropriate message.

**3. Not considering the order of the integers**

The problem statement states that the integers should be concatenated in order. However, it is possible for a user to enter the integers in a different order. If this happens, the program should still be able to correctly find the smallest possible number that can be formed by concatenating all of the integers.

**4. Not handling duplicate integers correctly**

The problem statement does not specify whether or not the input integers can be duplicates. If the integers are allowed to be duplicates, the program should still be able to correctly find the smallest possible number that can be formed by concatenating all of the integers.

**5. Not handling invalid input correctly**

The problem statement does not specify what should happen if the input is invalid. For example, if the user enters a non-integer value, the program should handle the error gracefully and output an appropriate message.
Test inputs:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

```
n = int(input())
nums = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]

```

**2. Not handling negative integers correctly**

```
n = int(input())
nums = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]

ans = ""
for num in nums:
    if num < 0:
        print("Invalid input")
        exit(1)
    ans += str(num)

print(ans)
```

**3. Not considering the order of the integers**

```
n = int(input())
nums = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]

nums.sort()

ans = ""
for num in nums:
    ans += str(num)

Title:
HACKEREARTH the-witches-of-hegwarts-1

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input format is not clear. Is it one integer per line, or a list of integers?
* The output format is not clear. Do you need to print one integer per line, or a list of integers?
* The constraints are not clear. What is the maximum value of `n`?
* The example input and output are not correct. In the first test case, the enemy's power is 1, so you should need 0 hits to defeat him.
* The example input and output are not correct. In the second test case, the enemy's power can be reduced to 1 in one step by using the first witch's power, not the second witch's power.
* The example input and output are not correct. In the third test case, the enemy's power can be reduced to 1 in one step by using the first witch's power, not the third witch's power.
* The example input and output are not correct. In the fourth test case, PandeyG can reduce the enemy's power in 1 step, not 2 steps, by using his second power once.
* The example input and output are not correct. In the fifth test case, there is only one way to reduce the enemy's power to 1:

```
Reduce 5 by 1 to make it 4.
Reduce 4 by 1 to make it 3.
Reduce 3 to 1, by making it one third. \frac{3}{3} = 1.
```

This takes 3 steps.

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start with the enemy's power, `n`. We then repeatedly apply the following steps until `n` is equal to 1:

1. If `n` is divisible by 3, we divide it by 3.
2. If `n` is divisible by 2, we divide it by 2.
3. Otherwise, we subtract 1 from `n`.

This algorithm will always find the minimum number of hits needed to defeat the enemy.

**Code:**

```python
def solve(n):
    hits = 0
    while n > 1:
        if n % 3 == 0:
            n //= 3
        elif n % 2 == 0:
            n //= 2
        else:
            n -= 1
        hits += 1
    return hits


t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    print(solve(n))

Title:
ATCODER p02553 AtCoder Beginner Contest 178 - Product Max

Pain points:
The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are:

* **Incorrect input handling.** The input format is not very clear, so it is easy to make mistakes when reading the input. For example, the input could be "1 2 3 4" or "1,2,3,4". The developer should make sure to handle both cases correctly.
* **Incorrect output formatting.** The output should be a single integer, but it is easy to make mistakes when formatting the output. For example, the output could be "1234" or "1234.0". The developer should make sure to format the output correctly.
* **Incorrect calculation.** The problem requires the developer to find the maximum possible value of x * y. This can be a tricky problem, especially if the values of a, b, c, and d are large. The developer should make sure to use the correct mathematical operations to calculate the maximum value.
* **Off-by-one errors.** It is easy to make off-by-one errors when calculating the maximum value of x * y. For example, the developer might forget to include the value of a or d in the calculation. The developer should carefully check their code to make sure that there are no off-by-one errors.

By following these tips, developers can avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
ATCODER p02684 AtCoder Beginner Contest 167 - Teleporter

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input states that `N` and `K` can be up to `2 * 10^5`, and `A_i` can be up to `10^{18}`. This means that we need to use a data type that can store numbers of this size. If we use a data type that is too small, we will get an overflow error.

**2. Not using the correct algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a simple mathematical formula. However, if we use a more complicated algorithm, we may introduce bugs.

**3. Not handling edge cases correctly**

The problem states that `1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5` and `1 <= A_i <= N`. This means that we need to handle the cases where `N = 1` and `A_i = 1`. If we do not handle these cases correctly, we will get incorrect results.

**4. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it to the judge. This will help you to catch bugs before they cause you to lose points.

**5. Not reading the problem statement carefully**

The problem statement is very important. If you do not read it carefully, you may make mistakes in your solution.

Title:
ATCODER p02812 AtCoder Beginner Contest 150 - Count ABC

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one errors**. When counting the number of occurrences of a substring, it is easy to make a mistake and count one occurrence too many or too few. This can happen if you forget to include the first character of the substring in your count, or if you include the last character of the substring in your count.
2. **Incorrect use of indices**. When iterating over a string, it is important to use the correct indices. For example, if you are trying to find the first occurrence of a substring in a string, you should start your search at index 0. If you start your search at index 1, you will miss the first occurrence of the substring.
3. **Incorrect use of string functions**. There are a number of string functions that can be used to find substrings in a string. It is important to use the correct function for the task at hand. For example, the `find()` function returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string, while the `rfind()` function returns the index of the last occurrence of a substring in a string.
4. **Incorrect use of regular expressions**. Regular expressions can be used to find substrings in a string. However, it is important to use the correct regular expression for the task at hand. For example, the regular expression `^ABC$` will match any string that starts with `ABC` and ends with `ABC`. If you are only interested in matching strings that contain `ABC` as a contiguous substring, you should use the regular expression `(ABC)+\`.
5. **Incorrect use of data structures**. When solving problems with strings, it is often helpful to use data structures such as arrays, lists, and dictionaries. However, it is important to use the correct data structure for the task at hand. For example, if you are only interested in finding the first occurrence of a substring in a string, you should use an array. If you are interested in finding all occurrences of a substring in a string, you should use a list.

**1. Incorrect graph traversal**

The problem statement says that we can traverse edges multiple times. However, the code only traverses each edge once. This means that the code will not find the optimal solution.

**2. Incorrect payment calculation**

The problem statement says that we pay T * P coins when we end the game. However, the code only pays P coins. This means that the code will not find the optimal solution.

**3. Incorrect edge cost calculation**

The problem statement says that we can collect the coins placed along an edge each time we traverse it. However, the code only collects the coins once. This means that the code will not find the optimal solution.

**4. Incorrect score calculation**

The problem statement says that our score is the number of coins we have after paying T * P coins. However, the code does not subtract T * P coins from our score. This means that the code will not find the optimal solution.

**5. Incorrect input parsing**

The problem statement says that the input is given in the following format:

```
N M P
A_1 B_1 C_1
:
A_M B_M C_M
```

However, the code does not parse the input correctly. This means that the code will not find the optimal solution.

**6. Incorrect output formatting**

The problem statement says that the output should be the maximum value of the score that can be obtained. However, the code does not print the maximum value. This means that the code will not find the optimal solution.

**7. Incorrect error handling**

The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input is invalid. However, the code does not handle invalid input correctly. This means that the code may crash or produce incorrect results.

ATCODER p03380 AtCoder Beginner Contest 094 - Binomial Coefficients

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the binomial coefficient formula.** The binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$ is defined as the number of ways to choose $k$ objects from a set of $n$ objects, disregarding order. It can be calculated using the following formula:

$$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$

where $n!$ is the factorial of $n$.

**Incorrectly handling the case where $n < k$.** The binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$ is undefined for $n < k$. In this case, the developer should return an error or an empty list.

**Using an incorrect data type for the input or output.** The input and output of this problem are lists of integers. The developer should make sure that they are using the correct data type for these values.

**Not handling the case where there are multiple pairs of numbers that maximize the value of the binomial coefficient.** In this case, the developer should return any one of the valid pairs.

**Not handling the case where the input is invalid.** The input to this problem is guaranteed to be valid. However, the developer should still check for invalid input and return an error or an empty list if necessary.

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a string of four digits, each between 0 and 9. If the input is not in the correct format, the program will not be able to solve the problem.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a string of the form `A op1 B op2 C op3 D = 7`, where `op1`, `op2`, and `op3` are either `+` or `-`. If the output is not in the correct format, the program will not be accepted.
3. **Incorrect solution.** The program should find a solution to the equation `A op1 B op2 C op3 D = 7`, where `op1`, `op2`, and `op3` are either `+` or `-`. If the program does not find a solution, or if the solution is incorrect, the program will not be accepted.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** When performing calculations, it is important to be careful to avoid off-by-one errors. For example, if the program is supposed to add two numbers, but it accidentally subtracts one of them, the result will be incorrect.
5. **Indexing errors.** When accessing elements of an array or other data structure, it is important to be careful to check the indices. For example, if the program tries to access an element of an array that does not exist, the program will crash.
6. **Memory errors.** If the program allocates too much memory, it may run out of memory and crash. It is important to be careful to only allocate the amount of memory that is needed.
7. **Time complexity.** The program should run in a reasonable amount of time. If the program takes too long to run, it may not be able to finish before the time limit is reached.
8. **Space complexity.** The program should use a reasonable amount of space. If the program uses too much space, it may run out of memory and crash.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the number of sweets is not a positive integer, or if the weight of a nutrient is not a non-negative integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The program may incorrectly calculate the total weight of nutrients or calories, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program incorrectly adds the weight of two nutrients, the total weight may be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The program may output the results in an incorrect format, which may make it difficult for users to understand. For example, if the program outputs the results in a different order than the input, it may be difficult for users to find the correct results.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program may not properly release memory after it is finished using it, which may lead to a memory leak. A memory leak can cause the program to run slowly or crash.
5. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may have security vulnerabilities that allow attackers to exploit the program. For example, if the program allows users to input arbitrary data, attackers may be able to inject malicious code into the program.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully follow the input format, correctly calculate the total weight of nutrients and calories, correctly output the results in the correct format, and properly release memory after it is finished using it. They should also carefully review the program for security vulnerabilities and fix any vulnerabilities that they find.

Title:
AIZU p00410 Dungeon 3

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not standard. For example, the input format does not specify the type of each input. This can lead to errors in the program if the developer does not correctly parse the input.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is also not standard. For example, the output format does not specify the type of the output. This can lead to errors in the program if the developer does not correctly format the output.

**3. Incorrect data type**

The problem does not specify the data type of the input values. This can lead to errors in the program if the developer does not correctly cast the input values to the correct data type.

**4. Incorrect assumptions**

The problem states that "any treasure trove can be reached from any treasure trove via one or more passages". However, this is not always true. For example, if there is no path between two treasure troves, then they cannot be reached from each other.

**5. Incorrect implementation**

The developer may implement the solution incorrectly. For example, the developer may not correctly account for all of the constraints in the problem. This can lead to incorrect results.

**6. Incorrect testing**

The developer may not test the solution correctly. For example, the developer may not test the solution on all possible input values. This can lead to errors in the solution that are not caught until the program is deployed in production.

Title:
AIZU p00615 Traffic Analysis

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a line with more than two integers, or the integers may not be in the correct range.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may contain more than one integer, or the integers may not be in the correct range.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm may not be correct. For example, the algorithm may not find the maximum time interval where cars did not pass through the monitoring line.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. The implementation of the algorithm may contain bugs. For example, the implementation may not handle all possible cases correctly.
5. **Incorrect testing**. The testing of the program may not be comprehensive. For example, the program may not be tested with all possible input values.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements. It is also important to test the program thoroughly with a variety of input values.

Title:
AIZU p00754 The Balance of the World

Pain points:

 **1. Using incorrect data types**

When checking for balanced brackets, it is important to use the correct data types. For example, if you are using a string to represent the brackets, you will need to make sure that you are comparing the strings correctly. One way to do this is to use the `.equals()` method.

**2. Forgetting to check for unmatched brackets**

Another common mistake is to forget to check for unmatched brackets. This can happen if you are only checking for the presence of a certain type of bracket. For example, if you are only checking for round brackets, you will need to make sure that you also check for square brackets.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

When checking for balanced brackets, it is important to use the correct logic. For example, you will need to make sure that you are checking for the correct order of brackets. For example, a round bracket must always be followed by a square bracket.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

It is also important to handle edge cases when checking for balanced brackets. For example, what happens if the string contains no brackets? Or what happens if the string contains an unmatched bracket? You will need to make sure that your code handles these cases correctly.

**5. Using inefficient algorithms**

Finally, it is important to use efficient algorithms when checking for balanced brackets. This means that you should avoid using algorithms that are too slow or that take up too much memory. One way to do this is to use a stack data structure.

Title:
AIZU p01023 Caterpillar

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is specified as follows:

```
H W N
area
```

where `H`, `W`, and `N` are integers, and `area` is a string. However, the input may not be in this format. For example, the input may contain characters other than numbers, spaces, or `#` and `.`. If the input is not in the correct format, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is specified as follows:

```
number of steps
```

where `number of steps` is an integer. However, the output may not be in this format. For example, the output may contain characters other than numbers. If the output is not in the correct format, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect data**

The input data may be incorrect. For example, the input may contain a negative number, a number greater than 10, or a number that is not an integer. If the input data is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

**4. Insufficient memory**

The program may run out of memory if the input data is too large. In this case, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

**5. Errors in the algorithm**

The program may contain errors in the algorithm. For example, the program may not correctly find the shortest path to the food. If the algorithm contains errors, the program may produce incorrect output.

# Problem: AIZU p01155 Ruins
# https://atcoder.jp/contests/aizu_dp/tasks/aizu_dp_f

# Inputs
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Constants
mod = 10**9 + 7

# Solves the problem
def solve(a, b):

# Prints the solution

```

### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format for this problem is two positive integers not greater than 10,000. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash. For example, if the input is "33 40 57", the program will crash because the third input is not a positive integer.

### 2. Incorrect output format

The output for this problem should be a single integer that represents the minimum square sum. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be accepted. For example, if the output is "33 40", the program will not be accepted because it is not a single integer.

### 3. Incorrect calculation of the minimum square sum

The minimum square sum is the sum of the squares of the differences between each pair of adjacent integers in a sorted sequence that contains four positive integers $a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2$ such that $a = a_1a_2$ and $b = b_1b_2$. The program must correctly calculate this sum in order to get the correct answer. For example, if the input is "33 40", the program must correctly calculate the minimum square sum as $(5 - 3)^2 + (8 - 5)^2 + (11 - 8)^2 = 22$.

### 4. Overflow

The program must be careful not to overflow when calculating the minimum square sum. For example, if the input is "999999999 999999999", the program must correctly calculate the minimum square sum as $(999999999 - 999999998)^2 + (999999999 - 999999997)^2 = 2$.

Title:
AIZU p01294 For the Peace

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The problem specifies that the number of countries and the tolerated difference of potential should be positive integers. However, the following code will not work correctly:

```
n, d = map(int, input().split())
```

This is because `map()` returns a tuple, and the first element of the tuple is a `str` object, not an `int` object. To fix this, we can use the `int()` function to explicitly convert the first element of the tuple to an `int` object:

```
n, d = map(int, input().split())
```

2. **Incorrect variable name**. The problem specifies that the number of missiles possessed by each country should be a non-negative integer. However, the following code will not work correctly:

```
m = int(input())
```

This is because `m` is a variable name that is already used by the `math` module. To fix this, we can use a different variable name, such as `mi`:

```
mi = int(input())
```

3. **Incorrect indentation**. The problem specifies that the output should be a single line. However, the following code will not work correctly:

```
print("Yes")
```

This is because the output is not indented correctly. To fix this, we can add an extra space before the `print()` statement:

```
print("Yes")
```

4. **Incorrect use of the `for` loop**. The problem specifies that the input is a sequence of datasets. Each dataset is given in the following format:

```
n d
m1 c1,1 ... c1,m1
...
mn cn,1 ... cn,mn
```

However, the following code will not work correctly:

```
for _ in range(n):
    n, d = map(int, input().split())
```

This is because the `for` loop is not iterating over the correct data. To fix this, we can use the following code:

```
for _ in range(n):
    mi = int(input())
    c = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

5. **Incorrect use of the `min()` and `max()` functions**. The problem specifies that the difference between the maximum and minimum potential should not exceed `d`. However, the following code will not work correctly:

```
if max(c) - min(c) <= d:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```

This is because the `min()` and `max()` functions are not being used correctly. To fix this, we can use the following code:

```
if max(c) - min(c) <= d:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")

Title:
AIZU p01622 Twin book report

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

1. The input format is not clear. It is not clear how to represent the number of books, the time to read each book, and the time to write an impression.
2. The problem statement does not specify what to do if two people try to read the same book at the same time.
3. The problem statement does not specify what to do if someone interrupts reading a book or writing an impression.
4. The problem statement does not specify what to do if someone tries to write an impression of a book that they have not read.
5. The problem statement does not specify what to do if the time to finish reading all the books is not the shortest.

**Solutions:**

1. The input format can be represented as follows:

```
N
r1 w1
r2 w2
...
rN wN
```

where N is the number of books, ri is the time to read the i-th book, and wi is the time to write an impression of the i-th book.

2. If two people try to read the same book at the same time, then one of them must wait until the other person is finished reading the book.
3. If someone interrupts reading a book or writing an impression, then they must start over from the beginning.
4. If someone tries to write an impression of a book that they have not read, then they must not write the impression.
5. If the time to finish reading all the books is not the shortest, then the solution is not valid.

**Code:**

```python
def solve(n, r, w):
  # Sort the books by the time it takes to read them.
  books = sorted(zip(r, w), key=lambda x: x[0])

  # Find the minimum time to finish reading all the books.
  total_read_time = 0
  for r, w in books:
    total_read_time += r

  # Find the minimum time to finish writing all the impressions.
  total_write_time = 0
  for r, w in books:
    total_write_time += w

  # Return the minimum time to finish all the homework.
  return total_read_time + total_write_time


def main():
  # Get the number of books.
  n = int(input())

  # Get the time it takes to read each book.
  r = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

  # Get the time it takes to write an impression of each book.
  w = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

  # Solve the problem.
  solution = solve(n, r, w)

  # Print the solution.
  print(solution)

Title:
AIZU p01909 Graduation Ceremony

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem states that "the Manhattan distance from the origin is as far as possible", but some developers may mistakenly think that the goal is to maximize the sum of $|x'| + |y'|$.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for finding the maximum value of $|x'| + |y'|$ is relatively simple, but some developers may make mistakes in their implementation.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement does not explicitly mention any edge cases, but there are a few cases that developers should be aware of. For example, what happens if the input string is empty? What happens if the value of $K$ is 0?
4. **Failure to test the code.** It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. This includes testing the code with different input values, as well as testing for edge cases.
5. **Incorrect submission of the code.** Once the code is correct, it must be submitted correctly. This includes making sure that the code is formatted correctly and that it is uploaded to the correct location.

By following these tips, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving this problem.
