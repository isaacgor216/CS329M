CODECHEF ccaurcc5

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect logic**. The logic for finding prime palindromes is incorrect. For example, the number 11 is a prime number, but it is not a prime palindrome because its reverse is not the same as the original number.
2. **Incorrect implementation**. The implementation of the logic is incorrect. For example, the code below will not correctly find all prime palindromes between 1 and 100:
```
for i in range(1, 101):
    if is_prime(i) and is_palindrome(i):
        print(i)
```
3. **Incorrect input**. The input data may be incorrect. For example, the input data may contain a number that is not an integer or a number that is outside the specified range.
4. **Incorrect output**. The output may be incorrect. For example, the output may not be the sum of all prime palindromes between the specified range.
5. **Other bugs**. There may be other bugs in the code that are not listed here.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1085_D. Minimum Diameter Tree

Pain points:

 It is easy to see that the diameter of this tree is 0.5. It can be proved that it is the minimum possible diameter.
 1. **Inability to correctly find the diameter of the tree.** This is a common mistake that can be made when solving this problem. The diameter of a tree is the longest path between two vertices in the tree. To find the diameter, you need to find all the paths in the tree and then find the longest one.
2. **Incorrectly assigning weights to the edges of the tree.** When assigning weights to the edges of the tree, it is important to make sure that the sum of the weights of all the edges is equal to the given value of `s`. Additionally, it is important to make sure that the weights are non-negative.
3. **Not taking into account the fact that the tree is acyclic.** A tree is acyclic, which means that it does not contain any cycles. This means that when finding the diameter of the tree, you cannot consider paths that pass through the same edge more than once.
4. **Not using the fact that the diameter of a tree is equal to the maximum distance between any two vertices in the tree.** The diameter of a tree is equal to the maximum distance between any two vertices in the tree. This means that you can find the diameter by finding the maximum distance between any two vertices in the tree.
5. **Not using the fact that the diameter of a tree is equal to the sum of the weights of the longest path in the tree.** The diameter of a tree is equal to the sum of the weights of the longest path in the tree. This means that you can find the diameter by finding the sum of the weights of the longest path in the tree.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

1. Make sure that you understand the definition of the diameter of a tree.
2. Be careful when finding all the paths in the tree. Make sure that you do not count any paths more than once.
3. Make sure that the sum of the weights of all the edges is equal to the given value of `s`.
4. Make sure that the weights of the edges are non-negative.
5. Remember that the tree is acyclic. This means that you cannot consider paths that pass through the same edge more than once.
6. Use the fact that the diameter of a tree is equal to the maximum distance between any two vertices in the tree.
7. Use the fact that the diameter of a tree is equal to the sum of the weights of the longest path in the tree.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1105_B. Zuhair and Strings

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The most common mistake is to implement the algorithm incorrectly. This can lead to incorrect results or even a runtime error.

**2. Using incorrect data types**

Another common mistake is to use incorrect data types. For example, using an integer to store a string will lead to incorrect results.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

It is important to handle edge cases when writing code. For example, if the input string is empty, the algorithm should return 0.

**4. Using inefficient algorithms**

Using an inefficient algorithm can lead to slow runtimes. For example, using a brute-force algorithm to solve this problem would be very slow.

**5. Not debugging your code**

It is important to debug your code before submitting it. This can help you catch errors and ensure that your code is correct.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use a test suite to test your code. This will help you catch errors early on.
* Use the debugger to step through your code and see how it works. This can help you identify errors.
* Read the problem statement carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked.
* Ask for help from others if you are stuck. There are many online resources available to help you learn and improve your coding skills.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1132_E. Knapsack

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data contains a lot of integers, so it's important to use the correct data types to avoid overflow errors. For example, if you use `int` to store the weight of an item, you may get an incorrect answer when the weight is greater than `2147483647`.

**2. Using incorrect algorithms**

The naive solution to this problem is to enumerate all possible subsets of items and check if each subset is good. This algorithm has a time complexity of `O(2^n)`, where `n` is the number of items. For large values of `n`, this algorithm will not be able to finish in a reasonable amount of time.

A more efficient solution is to use dynamic programming. The idea is to construct a table `dp[i][j]`, where `i` is the index of the item and `j` is the maximum weight of a good subset that can be obtained by using the first `i` items. The table can be filled in using the following recurrence relation:

```
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - w[i]] + v[i])
```

where `w[i]` is the weight of the `i`th item and `v[i]` is its value. The final answer is `dp[n][W]`.

**3. Incorrect implementation**

Even if you use the correct data types and algorithms, you may still get an incorrect answer if your implementation is incorrect. For example, you may forget to initialize the table `dp` or you may make a mistake in the recurrence relation.

**4. Unexpected edge cases**

The input data may contain some unexpected edge cases. For example, the input may contain a negative weight or a weight that is greater than `10^18`. You need to handle these edge cases correctly in order to get the correct answer.

**5. Not testing your code**

It's important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly for all possible inputs. You can use a test suite to generate random inputs and check if your code gives the correct answer.
Test inputs:
```
# Test case 1:
W = 10
cnt = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

# Test case 2:
W = 0
cnt = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

# Test case 3:
W = 3
cnt = [0, 4, 1, 0, 0, 9, 8, 3]
```

CODEFORCES 1272_D. Remove One Element

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly calculating the length of the longest increasing subarray.** This is the most common mistake, and it can be made in a number of ways. For example, you might forget to consider the first element of the array, or you might not account for the fact that the subarray can end at the end of the array.
2. **Not considering all possible ways to remove one element from the array.** When you're trying to find the maximum possible length of the strictly increasing contiguous subarray, you need to consider all possible ways to remove one element from the array. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, you need to consider removing the first element, the second element, the third element, and the fourth element.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are a number of different algorithms that you can use to solve this problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others, so it's important to choose the right one for your specific problem.
4. **Making a runtime error.** This can happen if you don't properly handle the edge cases. For example, if the array is empty, you need to return a value of 0.

CODEFORCES 1295_E. Permutation Separation

Pain points:
**1. Wrong implementation of the merge sort algorithm**

The merge sort algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts an array by splitting it in half repeatedly until each subarray consists of a single element. The two halves are then merged together in sorted order.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing the merge sort algorithm is to use an incorrect order for the merge operation. The merge operation should be performed in such a way that the elements in the sorted array are in ascending order. However, if the merge operation is performed in descending order, the resulting array will not be sorted.

**2. Using an incorrect data structure**

Another common mistake that developers make when solving this problem is to use an incorrect data structure. The merge sort algorithm works by repeatedly splitting the array in half until each subarray consists of a single element. The two halves are then merged together in sorted order.

To implement the merge sort algorithm, it is important to use a data structure that supports efficient splitting and merging operations. A good choice for this problem would be a linked list, as linked lists support efficient insertion and removal operations.

**3. Using an incorrect time complexity**

The merge sort algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n). This means that the running time of the algorithm is proportional to the logarithm of the size of the input array.

However, if the developer implements the merge sort algorithm incorrectly, the running time of the algorithm could be much worse. For example, if the developer uses an incorrect data structure or an incorrect order for the merge operation, the running time of the algorithm could be O(n^2).

**4. Using an incorrect space complexity**

The merge sort algorithm has a space complexity of O(n). This means that the amount of additional memory that the algorithm uses is proportional to the size of the input array.

However, if the developer implements the merge sort algorithm incorrectly, the space complexity of the algorithm could be much worse. For example, if the developer uses an incorrect data structure, the space complexity of the algorithm could be O(n^2).

**5. Using an incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is a list of integers. Each integer represents the value of an element in the permutation.

One common mistake that developers make when solving this problem is to use an incorrect input format. For example, if the developer uses a list of strings instead of a list of integers, the algorithm will not work correctly.

**6. Using an incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is a single integer. The integer represents the minimum number of dollars that the developer needs to spend to separate the permutation into two non-empty sets.

One common mistake that developers make when solving this problem is to use an incorrect output format. For example, if the developer prints a list of integers instead of a single integer, the solution will be incorrect.

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect variable type**. The variables used in the program must be of the correct type. For example, if a variable is declared as an integer but is used to store a floating-point number, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be correct. For example, if the program tries to divide a number by zero, the program will crash.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Use of uninitialized variables**. Uninitialized variables are variables that have not been assigned a value. Using uninitialized variables can lead to undefined behavior, which can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
6. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when the programmer forgets to free memory that has been allocated. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
7. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
8. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can lead to the program being stuck and unable to continue.
9. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can occur when the programmer does not properly protect the program's data. This can allow attackers to access sensitive data or take control of the program.

It is important to carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct.
2. **Using an inefficient algorithm.** There are many different ways to solve a problem, and some algorithms are more efficient than others. It is important to choose an algorithm that is appropriate for the problem you are trying to solve.
3. **Not handling special cases correctly.** Some problems have special cases that need to be handled differently than the general case. It is important to make sure that you handle these special cases correctly.
4. **Making a mistake in your reasoning.** This can happen when you are trying to solve a problem that is difficult or unfamiliar. It is important to take your time and carefully think through your solution.
5. **Not debugging your code effectively.** This is a common problem that can lead to many different types of errors. It is important to have a good debugging process in place so that you can quickly find and fix any errors in your code.

Here are some specific examples of problems and bugs that developers may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm:** A developer might incorrectly implement the algorithm for finding the minimum number of seconds in which the array can be made nondecreasing. For example, they might forget to add the current value of the array element to the running total of the maximum value of the array. This would result in an incorrect answer.
* **Using an inefficient algorithm:** A developer might use an inefficient algorithm to find the minimum number of seconds in which the array can be made nondecreasing. For example, they might use a brute-force algorithm that checks every possible combination of indices to select. This would be very inefficient for large arrays.
* **Not handling special cases correctly:** A developer might not handle special cases correctly when finding the minimum number of seconds in which the array can be made nondecreasing. For example, they might not handle the case where the array is already nondecreasing. This would result in an incorrect answer.
* **Making a mistake in your reasoning:** A developer might make a mistake in their reasoning when finding the minimum number of seconds in which the array can be made nondecreasing. For example, they might assume that the array is always nondecreasing, when in fact it is not. This would result in an incorrect answer.
* **Not debugging your code effectively:** A developer might not debug their code effectively when finding the minimum number of seconds in which the array can be made nondecreasing. This could lead to many different types of errors, such as incorrect results, runtime errors, and segmentation faults.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1400_A. String Similarity

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem asks for a binary string `w` of length `n` that is similar to all substrings of `s` of length `n`. A common mistake is to output a string `w` that is similar to only some of the substrings of `s` of length `n`.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution to this problem is relatively straightforward, but there are a few common mistakes that can be made. One common mistake is to forget to check that `n` is valid. Another common mistake is to incorrectly calculate the length of the substrings of `s` of length `n`.
3. **Incorrect test cases.** It is important to test your solution on a variety of test cases, including cases where `n` is small, cases where `n` is large, and cases where `s` contains all 0s or all 1s.
4. **Incorrect submission.** Make sure that you submit your solution in the correct format. The format for submitting solutions to Codeforces problems is described in the [Codeforces problemset](https://codeforces.com/problemset/).

Title:
CODEFORCES 1444_B. Divide and Sum

Pain points:
 
 **1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very strict. For example, the following input is also valid:

```
3
1 1 1 2 2 2
```

However, if the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will output incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also not very strict. For example, the following output is also valid:

```
2588544
```

However, if the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly output the answer and will receive a negative score.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the answer**

The most common mistake that programmers make when solving this problem is to incorrectly calculate the answer. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
def calculate_answer(a):
  n = len(a)
  answer = 0
  for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
      answer += abs(a[i] - a[j])
  return answer % 998244353
```

This code will not work correctly because it does not take into account the fact that the answer must be a multiple of 998244353.

**4. Using incorrect data structures**

Another common mistake that programmers make when solving this problem is to use incorrect data structures. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
def calculate_answer(a):
  n = len(a)
  answer = 0
  for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
      answer += abs(a[i] - a[j])
  return answer % 998244353
```

This code will not work correctly because it uses a list to store the array a. This is incorrect because the list data structure is not efficient for storing large arrays.

**5. Using incorrect algorithms**

The most important part of solving this problem is to use the correct algorithm. The following algorithm is incorrect:

```
def calculate_answer(a):
  n = len(a)
  answer = 0
  for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
      answer += abs(a[i] - a[j])
  return answer % 998244353
```

This algorithm is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the answer must be a multiple of 998244353.

**6. Not using the modulo operator**

The modulo operator (%) is used to find the remainder of a division. For example, 10 % 3 = 1. This means that 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.

The modulo operator is very important when solving this problem because it allows us to ensure that the answer is a multiple of 998244353.

**7. Not using the Sieve of Eratosthenes**

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a very efficient algorithm for finding all of the prime numbers less than a given number. This algorithm can be used to speed up the calculation of the answer to this problem.

CODEFORCES 172_B. Pseudorandom Sequence Period

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**

The modulo operator (%) in Python returns the remainder of a division. For example, 10 % 3 is 1, because 10 divided by 3 with remainder 1. However, in this problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer t such that `ri = ri + t` for all `i >= k`. This means that we need to find the smallest positive integer t such that `ri + t` is divisible by m. The modulo operator does not do this, so we need to use the divmod() function instead. The divmod() function takes two arguments, a dividend and a divisor, and returns a tuple containing the quotient and the remainder. For example, divmod(10, 3) returns (3, 1), because 10 divided by 3 is 3 with remainder 1.

**2. Not initializing the variables correctly**

In this problem, we need to keep track of the current value of the sequence, the previous value of the sequence, and the period of the sequence. We can do this by initializing three variables:

```
current_value = r0
previous_value = r0
period = 1
```

**3. Using an infinite loop**

The problem states that we need to find the smallest positive integer t such that `ri = ri + t` for all `i >= k`. This means that we need to iterate over the sequence until we find a value that repeats. We can do this using a while loop:

```
while current_value != previous_value:
    # Increment the current value
    current_value = (current_value * a + b) % m
    # Update the previous value
    previous_value = current_value
    # Increment the period
    period += 1
```

**4. Not handling the case where the period is 1**

The problem states that the period of the sequence may be 1. This means that we need to check if the current value is equal to the previous value before incrementing the period. We can do this by adding the following line to the while loop:

```
if current_value == previous_value:
    break
```

**5. Not printing the period**

The problem states that we need to print the period of the sequence. We can do this by adding the following line to the end of the program:

```
print(period)
```
Test inputs:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**

```
a, b, m, r0 = map(int, input().split())

current_value = r0
previous_value = r0

    current_value = (current_value * a + b) % m
    previous_value = current_value
    period += 1

if current_value == previous_value:
    break

print(period)
```

**2. Not initializing the variables correctly**

```
a, b, m, r0 = map(int, input().split())

current_value = r0
previous_value = r0
period = 1
```

**3. Using an infinite loop**

```
a, b, m, r0 = map(int, input().split())

current_value = r0
previous_value = r0
period = 1

while True:
    current_value = (current_value * a + b) % m
    previous_value = current_value
    period += 1

    if current_value == previous_value:
        break

print(period)
```

**4. Not handling the case where the period is 1**

```
a, b, m, r0 = map(int, input().split())

current_value = r0
previous_value = r0
period = 1

while current_value != previous_value:
    current_value = (current_value * a + b) % m
    previous_value = current_value
    period += 1

if current_value == previous_value:
    break

print(period)
```

**5. Not printing the period**

```
a, b, m, r0 = map(int, input().split())

current_value = r0
previous_value = r0
period = 1

while current_value != previous_value:
    current_value = (current_value * a + b) % m
    previous_value = current_value
    period += 1

CODEFORCES 265_A. Colorful Stones (Simplified Edition)

Pain points:
Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly initializing the position of Liss.** The first step in solving this problem is to initialize the position of Liss. This can be done by simply setting the position to 1. However, if the first character of `s` is not `R`, `G`, or `B`, then Liss will not be able to move and the answer will be incorrect. To avoid this problem, you can check the first character of `s` and make sure that it is one of the three colors before initializing the position.
* **Incorrectly updating the position of Liss.** After each instruction, you need to update the position of Liss. This can be done by simply incrementing the position by 1 if the instruction matches the color of the stone that Liss is standing on. However, if the instruction does not match the color of the stone, then Liss should not move. To avoid this problem, you can check the instruction and the color of the stone that Liss is standing on before updating the position.
* **Incorrectly handling the end of the sequence.** The sequence of stones may end before the instructions are finished. In this case, you need to make sure that Liss does not move beyond the end of the sequence. To do this, you can check the position of Liss after each instruction and make sure that it is less than the length of the sequence.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

CODEFORCES 289_A. Polo the Penguin and Segments 

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when printing the output. For example, if you forget to add a newline character at the end of the output, the program will not produce the correct output.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the answer**

The most common mistake is to incorrectly calculate the number of moves needed to make the value of the set of segments divisible by k. For example, if you forget to take into account the fact that the segments can overlap, the program will not produce the correct answer.

**4. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

The problem statement specifies some edge cases, such as the case when the set of segments is empty or the case when all segments have the same value. It is important to handle these edge cases correctly, otherwise the program will not produce the correct output.

**5. Incorrect use of data structures**

The problem can be solved using a variety of data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, or trees. It is important to choose the right data structure for the problem, otherwise the program will not be efficient.

CODEFORCES 575_I. Robots protection

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash or output incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The data type of the input and output values must be the same. For example, if the input is a string, the output must also be a string.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When computing the answer to a problem, it is important to make sure that all of the calculations are done correctly. For example, if you are computing the area of a circle, you must make sure to add 1 to the radius before you square it.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program must be correct in order for it to produce the correct output. For example, if you are trying to find the shortest path between two points, you must make sure to account for all possible paths.
5. **Memory leaks.** When a program is running, it allocates memory for the variables that it uses. If the program does not properly free this memory when it is finished with it, a memory leak will occur. This can eventually cause the program to crash.
6. **Race conditions.** When multiple threads are running in a program, it is possible for them to interfere with each other. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
7. **Deadlocks.** When two threads are waiting for each other to finish, a deadlock can occur. This can prevent the program from making any progress and eventually cause it to crash.

## 1. Index Out of Bounds

The most common bug that a developer may encounter when solving this problem is index out of bounds. This can happen when the developer tries to access an element of an array or list that does not exist. For example, if the array has 10 elements and the developer tries to access the element at index 11, this will cause an index out of bounds error.

To avoid this bug, the developer should always check the bounds of the array or list before accessing an element. This can be done using the `len()` function, which returns the number of elements in the array or list. For example, the following code will not cause an index out of bounds error:

```
if i < len(array):
    element = array[i]
```

## 2. Off-by-one errors

Another common bug that a developer may encounter when solving this problem is off-by-one errors. This can happen when the developer accidentally counts one element too many or one element too few. For example, if the developer is trying to find the maximum value in an array, they may accidentally start counting at index 0 instead of index 1. This would cause them to miss the first element in the array, which could lead to an incorrect answer.

To avoid this bug, the developer should carefully check their code to make sure that they are not counting any elements incorrectly. They should also use a debugger to step through their code and watch the values of the variables change. This can help them to identify any off-by-one errors that they may have made.

## 3. Incorrect logic

Another possible bug that a developer may encounter when solving this problem is incorrect logic. This can happen when the developer makes a mistake in their reasoning about the problem. For example, the developer may incorrectly assume that the maximum value in an array is always the last element. This would lead them to write incorrect code that would not find the correct answer.

To avoid this bug, the developer should carefully think about the problem and make sure that they understand the correct solution. They should also write unit tests to verify that their code is correct. This can help them to identify any errors in their logic before they cause problems in production.

## 4. Using the wrong data type

Another possible bug that a developer may encounter when solving this problem is using the wrong data type. This can happen when the developer does not correctly match the data type of the input to the data type of the output. For example, if the input is a string and the output is an integer, the developer may accidentally try to convert the string to an integer using the `int()` function. This would cause an error because the `int()` function cannot convert a string to an integer.

To avoid this bug, the developer should carefully check the data types of the input and output and make sure that they are using the correct data types. They should also use a type checker to verify that the data types are correct. This can help them to identify any errors in their code before they cause problems in production.

## 5. Using incorrect functions

Another possible bug that a developer may encounter when solving this problem is using incorrect functions. This can happen when the developer does not correctly understand the purpose of the function or when they accidentally use the wrong function. For example, the developer may accidentally use the `max()` function to find the minimum value in an array. This would cause an error because the `max()` function returns the maximum value, not the minimum value.

To avoid this bug, the developer should carefully read the documentation for the function and make sure that they understand how to use it correctly
Test inputs:
### 1. Index Out of Bounds

```
# 598_D. Igor In the Museum

n, m, k = map(int, input().split())

board = []
for i in range(n):
    board.append(input())

def count(i, j):
    if board[i][j] != '.':
        return 0
    
    count = 0
    directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
    for d in directions:
        if 0 <= i + d[0] < n and 0 <= j + d[1] < m and board[i + d[0]][j + d[1]] == '*':
            count += 1
    
    return count

ans = []
for _ in range(k):
    i, j = map(int, input().split())
    ans.append(count(i - 1, j - 1))

print(*ans)
```

This code will cause an index out of bounds error because the `count()` function tries to access the element at index `i + d[0]`, which is out of bounds of the array `board`.

### 2. Off-by-one errors

```
# 598_D. Igor In the Museum

n, m, k = map(int, input().split())

board = []
for i in range(n):
    board.append(input())

def count(i, j):
    if board[i][j] != '.':
        return 0
    
    count = 0
    directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
    for d in directions:
        if 0 <= i + d[0] < n and 0 <= j + d[1] < m and board[i + d[0]][j + d[1]] == '*':
            count += 1
    
    return count

ans = []
for _ in range(k):
    i, j = map(int, input().split())
    ans.append(count(i - 1, j - 1))

print(*ans)
```

This code will cause an off-by-one error because the `count()` function counts the number of pictures that Igor can see in the cell at (i, j), but it does not count the picture that is directly adjacent to the cell at (i, j).

### 3. Incorrect logic

```
# 598_D. Igor In the Museum

n, m, k = map(int, input().split())

board = []
for i in range(n):
    board.append(input())

def count(i, j):
    if board[i][j] != '.':
        return 0
    
    count = 0
    directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
    for d in directions:
        if 0 <= i + d[0] < n and 0 <= j + d[1] < m and board[i + d[0]][j + d[1]] == '*':
            count += 1
    
    return count

ans = []
for _ in range(k):
    i, j = map(int, input().split())
    ans.append(count(i - 1, j - 1))

print(*ans)
```

This code will cause an incorrect logic error because it assumes that the maximum number of pictures that Igor can see is the same as the number of pictures that are directly adjacent to the cell at (i, j). However, this is not always the case, as Igor may be able to see more pictures from other cells in the museum.

### 4. Using the wrong data type

```
# 598_D. Igor In the Museum

n, m, k = map(str, input().split())

board = []
for i in range(n):
    board.append(input())

def count(i, j):

        return 0

CODEFORCES 667_D. World Tour

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not correctly specified. For example, the input may contain a number of cities that is less than 4 or greater than 3000.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not correctly specified. For example, the output may not contain four integers or the integers may not be in the correct order.
3. **Incorrect solution.** The solution may not find the optimal tour or may find a tour that is not feasible. For example, the solution may find a tour that includes a city that is not connected to any other city.
4. **Memory leak.** The solution may not free up memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory overflow and the program crashing.
5. **Time complexity.** The solution may take too long to run. This can be a problem if the input is large or the solution is recursive.
6. **Incorrect data structures.** The solution may use data structures that are not appropriate for the problem. For example, the solution may use a linked list to store the cities in the tour, when a hash table would be more efficient.
7. **Incorrect algorithms.** The solution may use algorithms that are not efficient for the problem. For example, the solution may use a brute-force algorithm to find the optimal tour, when a more efficient algorithm is available.
8. **Incorrect implementation.** The solution may be incorrectly implemented, even if the algorithms and data structures are correct. For example, the solution may not correctly handle all of the corner cases.
9. **Bugs.** The solution may contain bugs that cause it to crash or produce incorrect results. Bugs can be caused by a variety of factors, including incorrect logic, incorrect code, and incorrect assumptions.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly handling boundary conditions.** The input may contain negative values, so it's important to check for them and handle them correctly.
2. **Not considering all possible cases.** The problem statement mentions that there are only rooks, bishops, and queens on the board. However, it's possible that the input contains other pieces, such as pawns or knights. If the code doesn't handle these cases correctly, it may produce incorrect results.
3. **Using incorrect data types.** The input may contain large values, so it's important to use the correct data types to store them. For example, using integers to store coordinates of the king and the black pieces may result in overflow errors.
4. **Not using efficient algorithms.** The problem can be solved using a brute-force approach, but this will be very inefficient for large inputs. A more efficient approach would be to use a divide-and-conquer algorithm or a dynamic programming algorithm.
5. **Not testing the code thoroughly.** It's important to test the code thoroughly to catch any bugs. This can be done by manually testing the code with a variety of inputs, or by using a test framework.

CODEFORCES 77_B. Falling Anvils

Pain points:
1. The most important problem is that the equation is not in a standard form. It can be rewritten as follows:

```
(p - 2a)^2 - 4aq^2 = 0
```

2. The second problem is that the equation has two roots, but we only need to find one of them. The other root is always negative, so we can ignore it.

3. The third problem is that the equation is not quadratic, so we cannot use the quadratic formula to find its roots. We can use the following method to find one of the roots:

```
p = 2a + sqrt(4aq^2)
```

4. The fourth problem is that the probability of a successful hit is not equal to the fraction of time that the equation has a root. The probability is actually equal to the integral of the function `f(p, q) = 1 / sqrt(4aq^2)` over the region where the equation has a root.

5. The fifth problem is that the integral cannot be evaluated analytically. We can use the following approximation to evaluate it:

```
P = 2 * sqrt(pi / a) * exp(-b^2 / 4a)
```

6. The sixth problem is that the approximation is not very accurate for small values of `a` and `b`. We can improve the accuracy by using a higher-order approximation.

7. The seventh problem is that the code must be written in a way that is efficient enough to pass the time limit. We can use the following optimizations to improve the efficiency of the code:

* Use vectorization to speed up the computation of the integral.
* Use multithreading to speed up the computation of the probability for multiple values of `a` and `b`.

8. The eighth problem is that the code must be written in a way that is correct. We can use the following techniques to verify the correctness of the code:

* Unit tests
* Integration tests
* Code reviews

9. The ninth problem is that the code must be written in a way that is readable and maintainable. We can use the following techniques to improve the readability and maintainability of the code:

* Use descriptive variable names
* Use comments to explain the code
* Use a consistent coding style

10. The tenth problem is that the code must be written in a way that is portable. We can use the following techniques to improve the portability of the code:

* Use standard libraries
* Use platform-independent code
* Avoid using compiler-specific features

CODEFORCES 803_A. Maximal Binary Matrix

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be two integers `n` and `k`, separated by a space. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to parse the input and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the lexicographically maximal matrix**. The lexicographically maximal matrix is the matrix with the largest value in the first row and column. To find this matrix, you need to iterate through all possible matrices and find the one with the largest value in the first row and column.
3. **Incorrect output**. The output should be a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns, filled with zeroes except for the first row and column, which should contain the values of the lexicographically maximal matrix. If the output is incorrect, the program will not be accepted by the judge.
4. **Memory issues**. If the matrix is too large, the program may run out of memory. To avoid this, you can use a more efficient data structure, such as a sparse matrix.
5. **Time complexity**. The time complexity of the algorithm should be O(nk), where `n` is the number of rows and `k` is the number of ones. If the time complexity is too high, the program will not be able to finish running in time.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand the input and output formats. You should also test your program thoroughly to make sure that it is correct and efficient.

CODEFORCES 827_E. Rusty String

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain a string of length greater than 5 * 10^5, or a string with a character other than "V", "K", or "?".
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not always correctly followed. For example, the output may contain a number that is not an integer, or a list of numbers that is not in increasing order.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program may be incorrect. For example, the program may not correctly calculate the number of possible periods, or it may not correctly print the list of possible periods in increasing order.
4. **Memory leaks.** The program may not release memory that it has allocated. This can lead to a system crash or other problems.
5. **Race conditions.** The program may not be thread-safe. This can lead to incorrect results or even a system crash.
6. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program may contain security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or SQL injection. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully follow the input and output formats, and to correctly implement the logic of the program. It is also important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it is free of bugs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 849_E. Goodbye Souvenir

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the data structure.** The data structure used to store the beads and their shapes must be able to handle both insertions and deletions efficiently. A simple array would not be sufficient, as it would require O(n) time to insert or delete an element. A more efficient data structure, such as a linked list or a binary search tree, would be needed.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm used to compute the memory of a subsegment must be correct. A common mistake is to forget to take into account the fact that the shapes of the beads may change over time. Another common mistake is to forget to account for the fact that the subsegment may not contain all of the beads in the string.
3. **Incorrect input validation.** The input must be validated to ensure that it is in the correct format. A common mistake is to forget to check that the number of beads and the number of changes and queries are both positive integers. Another common mistake is to forget to check that the shapes of the beads are all between 1 and n inclusive.
4. **Incorrect output formatting.** The output must be formatted correctly. A common mistake is to forget to print a newline character after each output line. Another common mistake is to print the output in the wrong order.
5. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that can occur when programming. They occur when a programmer forgets to add or subtract one from a variable. A common off-by-one error in this problem would be to forget to add one to the index of the first bead in the subsegment when computing its memory.
6. **Arithmetic errors.** Arithmetic errors can occur when a programmer makes a mistake in their calculations. A common arithmetic error in this problem would be to forget to carry a number when adding two integers.
7. **Logical errors.** Logical errors can occur when a programmer makes a mistake in their logic. A common logical error in this problem would be to assume that the subsegment contains all of the beads in the string when it does not.
8. **Runtime errors.** Runtime errors can occur when a program runs into an unexpected problem. A common runtime error in this problem would be to run out of memory when allocating space for the data structure.
9. **Debugging errors.** Debugging errors can occur when a programmer tries to fix a bug in their code. A common debugging error in this problem would be to make a mistake when changing the code to fix the bug.

By avoiding these common problems and bugs, you can increase the chances of writing a correct and efficient solution to this problem.

CODEFORCES 898_B. Proper Nutrition

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The input is a list of integers, but the code tries to divide it by a string. This will result in a `TypeError`.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator.** The code compares the input to `0`, but it should be comparing it to `0.0`. This will result in a `ValueError`.
3. **Off-by-one error.** The code calculates the number of bottles of Ber-Cola that can be bought, but it subtracts one from the total number of burles. This will result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Infinite loop.** The code enters an infinite loop if the input is negative. This is because the `while` loop condition is always true.
5. **Incorrect output format.** The code prints the answer in the wrong format. It should be `"YES\n"` followed by the two integers.

To avoid these problems, carefully check the types of your variables, use the correct comparison operators, and be careful with your calculations. It is also a good idea to test your code with different inputs to make sure it is working correctly.

Title:
HACKEREARTH chotu-and-hug-day

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input is a list of integers, but the code is expecting a list of strings. This will cause the code to crash.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator**. The code is comparing the absolute value of the difference between the girl's height and Chotu's height to the absolute value of the difference between the girl's height and Chotu's height + 1. This will always return 0, which is not the correct answer.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code is iterating through the list of girls, but it is not checking if the girl's height is less than Chotu's height. This means that the code will always return the absolute value of the difference between the girl's height and Chotu's height, which is not the correct answer.

To fix these problems, we can do the following:

1. Change the variable type of the input to a list of integers.
2. Use the correct comparison operator to compare the absolute value of the difference between the girl's height and Chotu's height to the absolute value of the difference between the girl's height and Chotu's height + 1.
3. Add a check to make sure that the girl's height is less than Chotu's height.

Title:
HACKEREARTH easy-factorial-a-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect factorial implementation.** The most common mistake is to use the incorrect formula for factorial. The factorial of a number n is defined as n! = n * (n - 1) * ... * 2 * 1. For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
2. **Using an incorrect modulus operator.** The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 = 1. When computing the factorial of a number modulo m, you need to use the following formula: (n!) mod m = (n mod m)! mod m.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When computing the factorial of a number, it is important to make sure that you add the terms in the correct order. For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, not 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 0.
4. **Recursion errors.** If you are using recursion to compute the factorial of a number, it is important to make sure that you handle the base case correctly. The base case for the factorial function is n = 0, where the factorial of 0 is 1.
5. **Memory errors.** When computing the factorial of a large number, it is important to make sure that you have enough memory available. If you do not have enough memory, you may encounter a segmentation fault or other memory-related errors.
6. **Floating-point errors.** When computing the factorial of a very large number, you may encounter floating-point errors. This is because the factorial of a large number is a very large number, and floating-point numbers cannot represent all possible numbers.

Title:
HACKEREARTH problem-2-2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not specified in the problem statement. A developer may incorrectly assume that the input format is "x y", where x and y are the number of red and yellow balls, respectively. However, the actual input format is "x y z", where x, y, and z are the number of red, yellow, and blue balls, respectively. This can lead to a incorrect solution.
2. **Incorrect calculation of chroma regularity**. The chroma regularity is the maximum number of objects of the same color that appear consecutively. A developer may incorrectly calculate the chroma regularity by counting the number of objects of each color and then taking the maximum. However, this is incorrect because the chroma regularity takes into account the order of the objects. For example, if there are 3 red balls and 2 yellow balls, the chroma regularity is 2 because there are 2 yellow balls that appear consecutively.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the min-arrangement algorithm**. The min-arrangement algorithm is a greedy algorithm that iteratively swaps two objects of different colors until the chroma regularity is minimized. A developer may incorrectly implement the algorithm by swapping two objects at random. This can lead to a suboptimal solution.
4. **Incorrect output**. The output of the program should be a single integer that represents the chroma regularity of the min-arrangement. A developer may incorrectly output the number of objects of each color or the order of the objects.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to carefully implement the min-arrangement algorithm. Finally, it is important to test the program with a variety of inputs to ensure that it is correct.

Title:
HACKEREARTH selection-3

Pain points:
**1. Using an inefficient sorting algorithm**

The most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem is to use an inefficient sorting algorithm. For example, sorting the list of strings using a bubble sort or a selection sort algorithm will take O(n^2) time, which is prohibitively slow for large lists of strings.

**2. Using a naïve approach to finding duplicates**

Another common mistake is to use a naïve approach to finding duplicates in the list of strings. For example, a developer might iterate through the list of strings twice, once to build a hash table of all the unique strings in the list, and then again to check if each string in the list is a duplicate. This approach will also take O(n^2) time, which is prohibitively slow for large lists of strings.

**3. Not handling the case where the list of strings is empty**

Some developers forget to handle the case where the list of strings is empty. If the list of strings is empty, the developer should simply print an empty list.

**4. Not handling the case where all of the strings in the list are duplicates**

Some developers forget to handle the case where all of the strings in the list are duplicates. If all of the strings in the list are duplicates, the developer should simply print the first string in the list.

**5. Using a data structure that is not appropriate for the problem**

Some developers use a data structure that is not appropriate for the problem. For example, a developer might use a linked list to store the list of strings, even though a hash table would be a more efficient data structure for this problem.

**6. Making a mistake in the code**

Even the most experienced developers can make mistakes in their code. It is important to carefully review your code to make sure that it is correct before submitting it.

**7. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code to make sure that it is working correctly. You should test your code on a variety of inputs, including small inputs, large inputs, and inputs that contain duplicates.

HACKEREARTH x-game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of XOR operation.** The XOR operation is a binary operation that returns the value 1 if the two operands are different, and 0 if they are the same. In this problem, the XOR operation is used to calculate the remaining power of a group of soldiers after they have fought. If the implementation of the XOR operation is incorrect, the remaining power of the group will be incorrect, and the final score will be incorrect.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the final score.** The final score is calculated by adding the remaining power of all the groups. If the calculation of the final score is incorrect, the output will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement specifies that the number of soldiers, N, must be between 1 and 10^5. If N is less than 1 or greater than 10^5, the program will crash. The problem statement also specifies that the power of each soldier must be between 0 and 10^9. If the power of a soldier is less than 0 or greater than 10^9, the program will crash.
4. **Incorrect input handling.** The problem statement specifies that the input will be a single integer, N, followed by a line of N integers. If the input does not match this format, the program will crash.
5. **Incorrect output handling.** The problem statement specifies that the output will be a single integer, the final score. If the output does not match this format, the program will be incorrect.

Title:
ATCODER p02768 AtCoder Beginner Contest 156 - Bouquet

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**

The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. This means that if you divide a number by another number, the modulo operator will return the remainder of the division. For example, if you divide 10 by 3, the modulo operator will return 1, because 10 / 3 = 3 with a remainder of 1.

In the problem statement, we are told that the answer should be modulo (10^9 + 7). This means that we need to find the remainder of the answer when divided by 10^9 + 7. If we accidentally use the wrong modulo operator, we may get an incorrect answer.

For example, if we use the modulo operator (%) instead of the modulo operator (%), we will get the wrong answer. For example, if the answer is 1000000007, the modulo operator (%) will return 7, but the modulo operator (^) will return 0.

**2. Using the wrong data type**

The problem statement states that the input will be integers. This means that we need to use the `int` data type to store the input values. If we accidentally use a different data type, we may get an incorrect answer.

For example, if we use the `float` data type to store the input values, we may get an incorrect answer. This is because the `float` data type can store values with decimals, while the `int` data type can only store whole numbers.

**3. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem statement states that we need to find the number of bouquets that Akari can make. This means that we need to find the number of ways to choose flowers from the n kinds of flowers, such that the number of flowers in the bouquet is not equal to a or b.

There are a few different ways to solve this problem. One way is to use the following algorithm:

1. Iterate over all possible values of k, where k is the number of flowers in the bouquet.
2. For each value of k, find the number of ways to choose k flowers from the n kinds of flowers.
3. Add the number of ways to choose k flowers from the n kinds of flowers to the total number of bouquets.

This algorithm will work, but it is not very efficient. A more efficient algorithm is to use the following formula:

```
B(n, a, b) = (n - a - b + 1) * B(n - 1, a, b)
```

where B(n, a, b) is the number of bouquets that Akari can make with n kinds of flowers, such that the number of flowers in the bouquet is not equal to a or b.

**4. Not handling the edge cases correctly**

The problem statement states that the number of flowers in the bouquet cannot be equal to a or b. This means that we need to handle the edge cases where a = 1 or b = n.

If a = 1, then the only way to make a bouquet that is not equal to 1 is to include all n kinds of flowers. This means that the number of bouquets that Akari can make is n.

If b = n, then the only way to make a bouquet that is not equal to n is to include no flowers. This means that the number of bouquets that Akari can make is 0.

We need to make sure to handle these edge cases correctly in our solution.
Test inputs:
**Incorrect:**
```
n = int(input())
a = int(input())
b = int(input())

if a == 1:
    print(n)
elif b == n:
    print(0)
else:
    print((n - a - b + 1) * (n - 2))
```

**Correct:**
```
n = int(input())
a = int(input())
b = int(input())

if a == 1:
    print(n)
elif b == n:
    print(0)
else:
    print((n - a - b + 1) * dp(n - 1, a, b) % (10 ** 9 + 7))

def dp(n, a, b):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    if a == 1 or b == n:
        return 0
    return (n - a - b + 1) * dp(n - 1, a, b) % (10 ** 9 + 7)

ATCODER p03038 AtCoder Beginner Contest 127 - Integer Cards

Pain points:
Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may not have the correct number of lines, or the values in the input may not be in the correct format.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not always correctly followed. For example, the output may not have the correct number of lines, or the values in the output may not be in the correct format.
* **Incorrect algorithm:** The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not find the optimal solution, or it may take too long to run.
* **Incorrect data structures:** The data structures used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the data structures may not be able to store the input data efficiently, or they may not be able to perform the required operations efficiently.
* **Incorrect error handling:** The code may not handle errors correctly. For example, the code may crash if the input data is invalid, or it may not provide any output if the problem cannot be solved.

By following the tips below, you can help to avoid these problems and bugs:

* **Test your code thoroughly:** Test your code with a variety of input data, including both valid and invalid data. Make sure that your code handles all possible errors gracefully.
* **Use the correct data structures:** Use data structures that are appropriate for the problem you are solving. For example, if you need to store a large amount of data, you should use a data structure that is designed for efficient storage.
* **Use the correct algorithms:** Use algorithms that are designed to solve the problem you are solving. For example, if you need to find the maximum value in a set of data, you should use a sorting algorithm.
* **Document your code:** Document your code so that other developers can understand how it works. This will help to avoid confusion and errors.

By following these tips, you can help to ensure that your code is correct and bug-free.

Title:
ATCODER p03179 Educational DP Contest - Permutation

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of modulo operator**

The modulo operator (%) is used to find the remainder of a division. For example, 10 % 3 = 1, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.

When using the modulo operator, it is important to make sure that the dividend is greater than or equal to the divisor. If the dividend is less than the divisor, the modulo operator will return a negative number.

For example, 5 % 3 = -2. This is because 5 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of -2.

To avoid this problem, you can either add 1 to the dividend before performing the modulo operation, or you can use the absolute value of the dividend.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a programmer forgets to add or subtract 1 from a variable. This can lead to incorrect results, or even to the program crashing.

To avoid off-by-one errors, it is important to be careful when counting and indexing. It is also helpful to use a debugger to step through your code and check for errors.

**3. Incorrect use of pointers**

Pointers are a powerful tool that can be used to access memory directly. However, if they are not used correctly, they can lead to memory errors and security vulnerabilities.

To avoid these problems, it is important to understand how pointers work and to use them carefully. You should also use a memory checker to check for memory errors.

**4. Uninitialized variables**

Uninitialized variables are variables that do not have a value assigned to them. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, or even to the program crashing.

To avoid this problem, you should always initialize your variables before using them. You can do this by assigning them a value, or by using the `NULL` pointer.

**5. Using the wrong data type**

Using the wrong data type can lead to incorrect results, or even to the program crashing.

For example, if you try to store a number that is too large in a variable of type `int`, the program will crash.

To avoid this problem, you should always use the correct data type for the values that you are storing.

**6. Ignoring edge cases**

Edge cases are special cases that occur when the input data is outside of the normal range. If you do not handle edge cases correctly, your program may not work correctly.

For example, if you are writing a program that sorts a list of numbers, you need to make sure that the list is not empty. If the list is empty, you should return an empty list instead of trying to sort it.

**7. Using incorrect algorithms**

There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve a given problem. Not all algorithms are created equal, and some algorithms are more efficient than others.

When choosing an algorithm to solve a problem, it is important to consider the time and space complexity of the algorithm. The time complexity is the amount of time that the algorithm takes to run, and the space complexity is the amount of memory that the algorithm uses.

You should choose an algorithm that has a time complexity that is appropriate for the problem that you are trying to solve. You should also choose an algorithm that has a space complexity that is within the limits of your system.

**8. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code to make sure that it is working correctly. This can be done by writing unit tests, integration tests, and system tests.

Unit tests test individual units of code, integration tests test how different units of code work together, and system tests test the entire system.

By testing your code, you can catch bugs early and prevent them from causing problems in production.
Test inputs:
**1. Incorrect use of modulo operator**

```
N = 5
s = "<><"

mod = 10**9 + 7
ans = 0
for i in range(N):
    if s[i] == "<":
        ans = (ans + i + 1) % mod
    else:
        ans = (ans + N - i) % mod
print(ans)
```

This code will output the wrong answer because it is using the modulo operator incorrectly. The modulo operator should be used to find the remainder of a division. In this case, the division is `(N - i) / i`. However, the code is using the modulo operator to find the remainder of `(N - i) % i`. This will always return 0, even if `N - i` is not divisible by `i`.

To fix this problem, we need to change the modulo operator to `(N - i) // i`. This will find the correct remainder, and the code will now output the correct answer.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

```
N = 5
s = "<><"

mod = 10**9 + 7
ans = 0
for i in range(N):
    if s[i] == "<":
        ans = (ans + i + 1) % mod
    else:
        ans = (ans + N - i) % mod
print(ans)
```

This code will also output the wrong answer because it is making an off-by-one error. The code is adding 1 to `i` when it should be subtracting 1 from `i`. This means that the code is counting the number of elements in the permutation from the wrong starting point.

To fix this error, we need to change the line `ans = (ans + i + 1) % mod` to `ans = (ans + N - i - 1) % mod`. This will fix the off-by-one error, and the code will now output the correct answer.

**3. Incorrect use of pointers**

```
N = 5
s = "<><"

mod = 10**9 + 7
ans = 0
for i in range(N):
    if s[i] == "<":
        ans = (ans + i + 1) % mod
    else:
        ans = (ans + N - i) % mod
print(ans)
```

This code will also output the wrong answer because it is using pointers incorrectly. The code is using the pointer `s[i]` to access the element in the string `s` at index `i`. However, the code is not checking to make sure that `i` is a valid index. If `i` is greater than the length of the string `s`, the code will access an invalid memory location and cause a segmentation fault.

To fix this problem, we need to check to make sure that `i` is a valid index before using the pointer `s[i]`. We can do this by using the `in` operator. The `in` operator checks to see if a value is in a sequence. In this case, we can use the `in` operator to check to see if `i` is in the range of valid indices for the string `s`.

```
N = 5
s = "<><"

mod = 10**9 + 7
ans = 0
for i in range(N):
    if i in range(N):
        if s[i] == "<":
            ans = (ans + i + 1) % mod
        else:
            ans = (ans + N - i) % mod
print(ans)
```

This code will now output the correct answer.

**4. Uninitialized variables**

```
N = 5
s = "<><"

mod = 10**9 + 7
ans = 0
for i in range(N):

        ans = (ans + i + 1) % mod
    else:
        ans = (ans + N - i) % mod
print(ans)
```

This code will also output the wrong answer because it is using uninitialized variables. The variable `ans` is not initialized before it is used in the first line of the code. This means that the value of

If the input string is not a palindrome, then there is no way to turn it into a palindrome by swapping two adjacent characters. In this case, the output should be `-1`.

**2. The input string may contain duplicate characters.**

If the input string contains duplicate characters, then it is possible to turn it into a palindrome by swapping two adjacent characters. However, the number of operations required to do this may not be minimal. In this case, the output should be the minimum number of operations required to turn the input string into a palindrome.

**3. The input string may contain characters that are not lowercase English letters.**

The input string must consist of lowercase English letters. If the input string contains any other characters, then the output should be `-1`.

**4. The input string may be empty.**

The input string cannot be empty. If the input string is empty, then the output should be `0`.

ATCODER p03648 AtCoder Regular Contest 079 - Decrease (Contestant ver.)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain an integer K. However, if the input contains something other than an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the first line should contain an integer N, followed by N integers. However, if the output does not match this format, the program will not be accepted.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of operations**. The problem states that the number of operations is equal to K. However, if the program incorrectly calculates the number of operations, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect choice of the largest element**. The problem states that the largest element in the sequence should be decreased by N. However, if the program incorrectly chooses the largest element, the output will be incorrect.
5. **Incorrect increment of the other elements**. The problem states that each of the other elements in the sequence should be increased by 1. However, if the program incorrectly increments the other elements, the output will be incorrect.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and make sure that your program correctly implements the required algorithm. Additionally, it is helpful to test your program on a variety of input values to ensure that it is working correctly.

Title:
ATCODER p03804 AtCoder Beginner Contest 054 - Template Matching

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect matching of template and image**

The most common mistake is to incorrectly match the template and image. This can happen if the template is not aligned correctly with the image, or if the template is too small or too large.

To avoid this problem, it is important to make sure that the template is properly aligned with the image and that the template is the correct size. One way to do this is to use the `match()` function in the `cv2` library. This function will find the best match for the template in the image and return the coordinates of the match.

**2. Incorrect handling of boundary conditions**

Another common mistake is to incorrectly handle the boundary conditions of the template and image. This can happen if the template extends beyond the edges of the image, or if the image is not large enough to contain the template.

To avoid this problem, it is important to make sure that the template does not extend beyond the edges of the image, and that the image is large enough to contain the template. One way to do this is to use the `copy()` function in the `cv2` library to create a copy of the image that is large enough to contain the template.

**3. Incorrect use of the `match()` function**

The `match()` function in the `cv2` library can be used to find the best match for the template in the image. However, it is important to use the function correctly to avoid errors.

To use the `match()` function correctly, it is important to specify the correct parameters. These parameters include the template image, the search image, the method to use for matching, and the threshold to use for matching.

**4. Incorrect use of the `minMaxLoc()` function**

The `minMaxLoc()` function in the `cv2` library can be used to find the minimum and maximum values of an array. However, it is important to use the function correctly to avoid errors.

To use the `minMaxLoc()` function correctly, it is important to specify the correct parameters. These parameters include the array to be searched, the index of the minimum value, and the index of the maximum value.

**5. Incorrect use of the `bitwise_and()` function**

The `bitwise_and()` function in the `cv2` library can be used to perform a bitwise AND operation on two images. However, it is important to use the function correctly to avoid errors.

To use the `bitwise_and()` function correctly, it is important to specify the correct parameters. These parameters include the first image, the second image, and the output image.

**6. Incorrect use of the `imshow()` function**

The `imshow()` function in the `cv2` library can be used to display an image on the screen. However, it is important to use the function correctly to avoid errors.

To use the `imshow()` function correctly, it is important to specify the correct parameters. These parameters include the image to be displayed, the window title, and the window size.

ATCODER p03972 CODE FESTIVAL 2016 qual B - Gr-idian MST

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is a 2D array, but the developer may accidentally treat it as a 1D array. This will cause the program to crash.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may accidentally miss one or more elements when iterating over the array. This will cause the program to output an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. This will also cause the program to output an incorrect answer.
4. **Memory leak**. The developer may not free the memory allocated for the array after it is no longer needed. This will cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
5. **Race condition**. The developer may not synchronize access to shared data between multiple threads. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
6. **Security vulnerability**. The developer may not properly validate user input. This can allow attackers to exploit the program to gain unauthorized access to the system.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully review the code and test it thoroughly. They should also use a debugger to help identify any errors.

AIZU p00192 Multistory Parking Lot

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect parking order**. The problem states that "If there are cars in multiple parking spaces that have passed the parking time at the same time, the car with the smallest parking space number will be shipped first." However, the following code does not follow this rule:

```
parked = [[] for _ in range(m)]
for i in range(n):
    t = int(input())
    if len(parked[0]) == 0:
        parked[0].append((t, i+1))
        continue
    for j in range(m):
        if len(parked[j]) == 0:
            parked[j].append((t, i+1))
            break
    elif parked[j][0][0] > t:
        parked[j].append((t, i+1))
        break
```

The correct code should be:

```
parked = [[] for _ in range(m)]
for i in range(n):
    t = int(input())
    if len(parked[0]) == 0:
        parked[0].append((t, i+1))
        continue
    for j in range(m):
        if len(parked[j]) == 0 or parked[j][0][0] > t:
            parked[j].append((t, i+1))
            break
```

2. **Incorrect handling of cars parked in the upper tier**. The problem states that "If the parking time of the car parked in the upper row has expired, you will have to wait until the car in the lower row leaves the garage. The upper car will be delivered at the same time after the lower car is delivered." However, the following code does not correctly handle this case:

```
def park(t):
    global parked, n
    if len(parked[0]) == 0:
        parked[0].append((t, n+1))
        n += 1
    else:
        for j in range(m):
            if len(parked[j]) == 0:
                parked[j].append((t, n+1))
                n += 1
                break
            elif parked[j][0][0] > t:
                parked[j].append((t, n+1))
                n += 1
                break

def leave(t):
    global parked, n
    for j in range(m):
        if len(parked[j]) > 0 and parked[j][0][0] == t:
            parked[j].pop(0)
            return parked[j][0][1]
    return -1

def main():
    global n
    while True:
        m, n = map(int, input().split())
        if m == 0 and n == 0:
            break
        for i in range(n):
            park(int(input()))
        for t in range(1200):
            if leave(t) != -1:
                print(leave(t), end=" ")
        print()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

The correct code should be:

```

        parked[0].append((t, n+1))
        n += 1

Title:
AIZU p00543 Swapping Bibs

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The input variables `N` and `M` are integers, but the code uses them as strings. This will cause errors when the program tries to divide them.
2. **Incorrect variable scope.** The variable `nums` is declared inside the `for` loop, but it is used outside of the loop. This will cause the variable to be undefined when it is used outside of the loop.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The code does not correctly implement the swapping algorithm. It should swap the numbers of the two students if the remainder of the first student's number divided by `k` is greater than the remainder of the second student's number divided by `k`.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The code does not correctly format the output. The output should be a list of `N` integers, one for each student.
5. **Missing error handling.** The code does not handle errors correctly. If the input is invalid, the program will crash.

To avoid these problems, you should:

1. Make sure that the input variables are of the correct type.
2. Use the `global` keyword to declare variables that are used outside of their scope.
3. Correctly implement the swapping algorithm.
4. Use the `print()` function to format the output correctly.
5. Add error handling to the code to catch invalid input.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, if the output contains a character that is not a digit, the program will crash.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the maximum total point**

The program may incorrectly calculate the maximum total point by not considering all possible ways to place the strings. For example, if the program only considers the first row of the table, it will not find the optimal solution.

**4. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

The program may not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the table is empty, the program should output 0, but it may output a wrong answer.

**5. Incorrect use of data structures**

The program may use data structures incorrectly. For example, if the program uses a linked list to store the strings, it may not be able to find the optimal solution.

**6. Incorrect use of algorithms**

Title:
AIZU p01725 Unordered Operators

Pain points:
**1. The input may contain invalid characters.**

For example, the input `3-2*a` is invalid because it contains the character `a`. The developer should check the input for invalid characters and raise an error if any are found.

**2. The input may not be a valid mathematical expression.**

For example, the input `3-2*3*` is not a valid mathematical expression because it has an incomplete operator. The developer should check the input for validity and raise an error if it is not valid.

**3. The developer may not be able to determine the correct precedence of the operators.**

For example, the input `(5-3*4)*(0-2+1)` could be evaluated in two different ways, depending on the precedence of the operators. The developer should choose a precedence that results in the maximum value.

**4. The developer may not be able to calculate the maximum value of the expression.**

For example, the input `1-2+3-4+5-6*0` could overflow a 64-bit integer. The developer should handle this case by either raising an error or returning a negative value.
Test inputs:

Title:
AIZU p01863 Miko Mi String

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem states that the input should be a single line containing the string S. However, if the input contains multiple lines or contains characters other than letters, the program will not be able to correctly process the input.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem states that the output should be either "Love AB!" or "mitomerarenaiWA". However, if the output contains any other characters, the program will not be able to correctly answer the problem.
3. **Incorrect use of variables**. The problem states that the input string S should be stored in a variable named S. However, if the program uses a different variable name, the program will not be able to correctly process the input.
4. **Incorrect use of functions**. The problem states that the program should use a high-speed function to receive the input. However, if the program uses a slow function, the program will not be able to correctly process the input in a timely manner.
5. **Incorrect logic**. The problem states that the program should output "Love AB!" if the string S is a Mikomi string. However, if the program outputs "Love AB!" for a string that is not a Mikomi string, the program will not be able to correctly answer the problem.
6. **Incorrect error handling**. The problem states that the program should output "mitomerarenaiWA" if the string S is not a Mikomi string. However, if the program does not output anything for a string that is not a Mikomi string, the program will not be able to correctly answer the problem.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement and to carefully design and implement the program. It is also important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it correctly handles all possible input cases.

However, it is important to use the algorithm correctly, otherwise you may miss some prime numbers. For example, if you only iterate over the odd numbers, you will miss all of the even prime numbers.
2. **Incorrect use of the Miller-Rabin primality test**. The Miller-Rabin primality test is a probabilistic algorithm for testing whether a given number is prime. However, it is important to use the algorithm correctly, otherwise you may incorrectly conclude that a number is prime when it is actually composite. For example, if you only use a small number of iterations, you may incorrectly conclude that a number is prime when it is actually composite.
3. **Incorrect handling of overflow**. When working with large numbers, it is important to be aware of the possibility of overflow. For example, if you add two large numbers together, the result may be larger than the largest representable integer. In this case, you will need to use a different data type to store the result.
4. **Incorrect handling of negative numbers**. The problem statement does not specify whether the input numbers can be negative. If you assume that the input numbers are non-negative, you may incorrectly calculate the number of prime pairs.
5. **Incorrect handling of duplicate pairs**. The problem statement does not specify whether the output should include duplicate pairs. If you incorrectly include duplicate pairs, you will overestimate the number of prime pairs.
6. **Incorrect formatting of the output**. The problem statement specifies that the output should be a single integer, followed by a newline character. If you incorrectly format the output, your submission will be incorrect.

Title:
AIZU p02144 Loss

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of jobs lost.** This is a common mistake that can be made when solving this problem. It is important to remember that the number of jobs lost is not the same as the number of jobs that are done. For example, if a job has two prerequisites, then the number of jobs lost is one, even though two jobs are done.
2. **Not considering the order in which the jobs are done.** The order in which the jobs are done can have a significant impact on the number of jobs lost. For example, if a job has two prerequisites, then the job with the smaller prerequisite number should be done first.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. The most efficient algorithm is a greedy algorithm that selects the job with the smallest loss and does it first.
4. **Misunderstanding the problem statement.** The problem statement is clear and concise, but it is important to make sure that you understand it before you start solving the problem.
5. **Making a careless mistake.** Even the most experienced programmers make careless mistakes. It is important to carefully check your code for errors before submitting it.

Title:
AIZU p02285 Binary Search Tree III

Pain points:
1. A developer may not be familiar with the binary search tree data structure. They may make mistakes in implementing the insert, find, and delete operations.
2. A developer may not be familiar with the inorder and preorder tree walks. They may make mistakes in printing the keys of the binary search tree.
3. A developer may not be familiar with the algorithm for deleting a node from a binary search tree. They may make mistakes in implementing the delete operation.
4. A developer may not be able to handle the constraints on the input data. They may make mistakes in their code that cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
5. A developer may not be able to debug their code effectively. They may spend a lot of time trying to find bugs that are not there, or they may not be able to find the real cause of a bug.

To avoid these problems, it is important for developers to be familiar with the binary search tree data structure and the algorithms for inserting, finding, and deleting nodes from a binary search tree. They should also be familiar with the inorder and preorder tree walks. In addition, they should be able to handle the constraints on the input data and be able to debug their code effectively.
