CODECHEF anumla

Pain points:
1. **Inconsistent input:** The input may not be consistent. For example, the input may contain a negative integer, or a number that is too large. The developer should check the input for consistency and raise an error if it is not consistent.
2. **Incorrect output:** The output may not be correct. For example, the output may not be in the correct format, or it may not contain the correct values. The developer should check the output for correctness and raise an error if it is not correct.
3. **Memory leaks:** The developer should be careful not to create any memory leaks. Memory leaks can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
4. **Race conditions:** The developer should be careful not to create any race conditions. Race conditions can cause the program to produce incorrect results.
5. **Deadlocks:** The developer should be careful not to create any deadlocks. Deadlocks can cause the program to hang indefinitely.
6. **Unhandled exceptions:** The developer should be careful to handle all exceptions that can be thrown by the program. Unhandled exceptions can cause the program to crash.

Title:
CODECHEF equation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` should be of type `int`. If they are declared as `float`, the program will produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator:** The comparison operator `<=` should be used to check if `a + b + c <= N`. If the operator `<` is used, the program will produce incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect loop condition:** The loop condition `i <= N` should be used to iterate over the values of `i` from 0 to `N`. If the loop condition `i < N` is used, the program will produce incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect initialization:** The variable `ans` should be initialized to 0 before the loop. If the variable `ans` is not initialized, the program will produce incorrect results.
5. **Off-by-one error:** The loop should iterate over the values of `i` from 0 to `N`. If the loop iterates over the values of `i` from 1 to `N`, the program will produce incorrect results.
6. **Incorrect calculation:** The number of solutions to the equation `a + b + c <= N` is equal to the number of ways to choose `a` values from `A`, `b` values from `B`, and `c` values from `C`. The formula for calculating this number is:

```
nC(a) * nC(b) * nC(c)
```

where `nC(k)` is the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements.

7. **Incorrect output:** The output should be a single integer representing the number of solutions to the equation `a + b + c <= N`. If the output is a list of integers, the program will produce incorrect results.

Title:
CODECHEF kprime

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple but efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit. It works by iteratively marking all multiples of each prime number as composite. However, if the implementation is incorrect, it may miss some prime numbers or mark some composite numbers as prime. This can lead to incorrect results when counting the number of k-primes between two numbers.
2. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. This can be a useful tool for checking if a number is divisible by another number. However, it is important to use the modulo operator correctly. For example, if you are checking if a number is divisible by 3, you should use the expression `n % 3 == 0`. If you use the expression `n % 3 == 3`, it will always return false, even if n is divisible by 3. This can lead to incorrect results when counting the number of k-primes between two numbers.
3. **Incorrect use of the factorial function.** The factorial function (n!) returns the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to n. This can be a useful tool for counting the number of ways to arrange a set of objects. However, it is important to use the factorial function correctly. For example, if you are counting the number of ways to arrange 3 objects, you should use the expression `3!`. If you use the expression `4!`, it will return the wrong answer. This can lead to incorrect results when counting the number of k-primes between two numbers.
4. **Incorrect use of the binomial coefficient function.** The binomial coefficient function (n,k) returns the number of ways to choose k objects from a set of n objects. This can be a useful tool for counting the number of combinations of a set of objects. However, it is important to use the binomial coefficient function correctly. For example, if you are counting the number of ways to choose 2 objects from a set of 5 objects, you should use the expression `5C2`. If you use the expression `5C3`, it will return the wrong answer. This can lead to incorrect results when counting the number of k-primes between two numbers.
5. **Incorrect use of the recursive function.** Recursive functions are a powerful tool for solving problems. However, they can be difficult to implement correctly. One common mistake is to forget to add a base case to the recursive function. A base case is a condition that stops the recursion from continuing. Without a base case, the recursive function will continue to call itself forever, which will eventually lead to a stack overflow error. This can lead to incorrect results when counting the number of k-primes between two numbers.

Title:
CODECHEF panstack

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The developer may implement the algorithm incorrectly, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may forget to take into account the constraint that the radius of the pancake should not exceed the radius of the largest pancake in the stack by more than 1. This could lead to the developer computing an incorrect answer.

**2. Using incorrect data types**

The developer may use incorrect data types, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may use a 32-bit integer to store the value of N, which could lead to overflow errors if N is large. This could lead to the developer computing an incorrect answer.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

The developer may make off-by-one errors, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may forget to add 1 to the number of ways a stack of size N can be created when computing the number of ways a stack of size N + 1 can be created. This could lead to the developer computing an incorrect answer.

**4. Using inefficient algorithms**

The developer may use inefficient algorithms, which could lead to slow performance. For example, the developer may use a brute-force algorithm to compute the number of ways a stack of size N can be created. This could lead to the developer's program running very slowly for large values of N.

**5. Using incorrect mathematical formulas**

The developer may use incorrect mathematical formulas, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may use a formula that does not account for the constraint that the radius of the pancake should not exceed the radius of the largest pancake in the stack by more than 1. This could lead to the developer computing an incorrect answer.

Title:
CODECHEF sswap

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable initialization**. The variable `i` is used to iterate over the string, but it is not initialized to 0. This will cause the loop to skip the first element of the string.
2. **Incorrect use of the `reverse()` method**. The `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in a list. In this problem, we need to reverse the order of the characters in a string. To do this, we can use the `[::-1]` slicing operator.
3. **Incorrect use of the `join()` method**. The `join()` method joins the elements of a list into a string. In this problem, we need to join the characters of a string into a single string. To do this, we can use the `''.join()` method.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The logic for determining the final string is incorrect. The following is the correct logic:

```
for i in range(len(s) - D + 1):
    new_s = s[i:i + D][::-1] + s[i + D:]
    s = new_s
```

This logic will reverse the first `D` characters of the string, then append the remaining characters to the end of the string. This will produce the correct final string.
Test inputs:
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 1007_B. Pave the Parallelepiped

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very clear. It is not clear whether the input should be a single line with three space-separated integers, or three lines with one integer each. This can lead to errors if the developer does not correctly parse the input.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the number of groups**

The number of groups of three integers that satisfy the given conditions can be calculated by using the following formula:

```
N = (A + 1) * (B + 1) * (C + 1) - 3
```

However, the developer may make a mistake in calculating this formula, which could lead to an incorrect answer.

**3. Overflow errors**

The numbers in this problem can be very large, so it is important to be careful to avoid overflow errors. For example, the following code will cause an overflow error:

```
int N = (A + 1) * (B + 1) * (C + 1) - 3;
```

To avoid this error, we can use the following code instead:

```
long N = (long) (A + 1) * (B + 1) * (C + 1) - 3;
```

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer, representing the number of groups of three integers that satisfy the given conditions. However, the developer may make a mistake in formatting the output, which could lead to a incorrect answer.

**5. Other bugs**

There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:

* Using the wrong data type for the input or output
* Using incorrect formulas to calculate the number of groups
* Making mistakes in the logic of the program
* Not handling special cases correctly

By carefully following the instructions in the problem statement and avoiding the common pitfalls listed above, you can write a correct and efficient solution to this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1030_B. Vasya and Cornfield

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain two integers n and d, and the second line should contain a single integer m. However, if the input format is not followed, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of grasshopper positions.** The program must calculate the x- and y-coordinates of each grasshopper and check whether they are inside the cornfield. However, if the calculation is incorrect, the program may incorrectly identify grasshoppers as being inside or outside the cornfield.
3. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that each line should contain a single string, either "YES" or "NO". However, if the output format is not followed, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
4. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem, such as incorrect variable initialization, incorrect logic, and incorrect error handling.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it produces the correct output for all possible inputs.
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect input format.**

```
# Incorrect input format
n, d = map(int, input().split())
m = int(input())
for i in range(m):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
```

This program will crash if the input format is not followed. For example, if the input is `1 2` instead of `7 2`, the program will crash.

2. **Incorrect calculation of grasshopper positions.**

```
# Incorrect calculation of grasshopper positions
n, d = map(int, input().split())
m = int(input())
for i in range(m):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if x < 0 or x > n or y < d or y > n - d:
        print("NO")
    else:
        print("YES")
```

This program will incorrectly identify some grasshoppers as being outside the cornfield. For example, if the input is `7 2`, `4`, `2 4`, the program will incorrectly identify the grasshopper as being outside the cornfield.

3. **Incorrect output format.**

```
# Incorrect output format
n, d = map(int, input().split())
m = int(input())
for i in range(m):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if x < 0 or x > n or y < d or y > n - d:
        print("NO")
    else:
        print("YES ")
```

This program will incorrectly format the output. The output should be a single string, either "YES" or "NO".

4. **Other bugs.**

```
# Other bugs
n, d = map(int, input().split())
m = int(input())
for i in range(m):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if x < 0 or x > n or y < d or y > n - d:
        print("NO")
    else:
        print("YES")
```

This program has a number of other bugs. For example, it does not check if the input is valid. It also does not handle the case where the number of grasshoppers is zero.
Title:
CODEFORCES 1051_G. Distinctification

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the dynamic programming solution.**

The dynamic programming solution to this problem involves maintaining a table of values $f(i, j)$, where $f(i, j)$ is the minimum cost of making the first $i$ elements of the sequence pairwise distinct, given that the last element is $j$. The table is filled in bottom-up, starting with $f(0, j) = 0$ for all $j$. To fill in the entry $f(i, j)$, we consider all possible values of $a_i$. If $a_i = j$, then $f(i, j) = f(i - 1, j)$. Otherwise, we have two options:

* We can increase $a_i$ to $j$, which costs $b_i$. In this case, $f(i, j) = f(i - 1, j) + b_i$.
* We can decrease $a_i$ to $j - 1$, which costs $-b_i$. In this case, $f(i, j) = f(i - 1, j - 1) - b_i$.

The final answer is $f(n, 1)$.

One common mistake that people make when implementing this solution is to forget to update the table when $a_i = j$. This can lead to incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect handling of duplicate values in the input.**

The input to this problem may contain duplicate values. For example, the input could contain two pairs of the form $(a, b)$ and $(a, c)$. In this case, we need to make sure that we only count the cost of increasing $a$ to $b$ once.

One way to do this is to maintain a set of all values that have already been seen. When we encounter a new value, we add it to the set. When we need to update the table, we only consider values that are not in the set. This ensures that we only count the cost of increasing a value to another value once.

**3. Incorrect handling of the boundary cases.**

The boundary cases for this problem are when $i = 0$ or $j = 1$. In these cases, the table is empty, and we need to handle them specially.

When $i = 0$, the table is empty, and the only possible value of $a_i$ is $j$. In this case, $f(0, j) = 0$.

When $j = 1$, the table is empty, and the only possible value of $a_i$ is not $j$. In this case, $f(i, 1) = \infty$.

**4. Incorrect implementation of the binary search algorithm.**

The binary search algorithm is a useful tool for finding the minimum value of a function. However, it is important to implement the algorithm correctly in order to get the correct results.

One common mistake that people make when implementing the binary search algorithm is to use the wrong comparison operator. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```

The problem with this code is that the comparison operator is reversed. This means that the algorithm will find the maximum value of the function, instead of the minimum value.

The correct implementation of the binary search algorithm is as follows:

```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```

**5. Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.**

Floating-point numbers are often used in programming, but they can be tricky to use correctly. One common mistake is to compare floating-point numbers for equality. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
if x == y

Title:
CODEFORCES 1075_A. The King's Race

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specified in the problem statement is "The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^{18}) — the length of the side of the chess field.

The second line contains two integers x and y (1 ≤ x,y ≤ n) — coordinates of the cell, where the coin fell.". However, the following input format is incorrect:

```
4
2 3
```

The correct input format is:

```
4
2,3
```

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specified in the problem statement is "In a single line print the answer "White" (without quotes), if the white king will win, or "Black" (without quotes), if the black king will win.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).". However, the following output format is incorrect:

```
White
```

The correct output format is:

```
White
```

3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of moves**. The white king moves first, then the black king, then the white king, and so on. The number of moves is equal to the number of cells on the chessboard. In the following example, the number of moves is calculated incorrectly:

```
n = 4
x = 2
y = 3

# Incorrect calculation of the number of moves
moves = n ** 2

# Correct calculation of the number of moves
moves = 4 * 4
```

4. **Incorrect calculation of the distance between the kings**. The distance between the kings is equal to the absolute value of the difference between their x-coordinates plus the absolute value of the difference between their y-coordinates. In the following example, the distance between the kings is calculated incorrectly:

```
n = 4
x = 2
y = 3

# Incorrect calculation of the distance between the kings
distance = abs(x - n) + abs(y - n)

# Correct calculation of the distance between the kings
distance = abs(x - 1) + abs(y - 1)
```

5. **Incorrect determination of the winner**. The winner is the king who reaches the cell with the coin first. In the following example, the winner is incorrectly determined:

```
n = 4
x = 2
y = 3

# Incorrect determination of the winner
if x < y:
    winner = "White"
else:
    winner = "Black"

# Correct determination of the winner
if x < y:
    winner = "Black"
else:
    winner = "White"

UUU\n` is not. The latter input will cause the following error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 16, in <module>
    x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '\n'
```

To avoid this error, make sure that the input format is strictly followed.

### 2. Incorrect output format

The output format of the problem is also not strictly defined. For example, the output `5` is valid, but the output `5\n` is not. The latter output will cause the following error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 24, in <module>
    print(ans)
ValueError: I/O operation on closed file.
```

To avoid this error, make sure that the output format is strictly followed.

### 3. Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of days

The minimum number of days required for the ship to reach the point (x_2, y_2) can be calculated as follows:

```
ans = abs(x_2 - x_1) + abs(y_2 - y_1)
```

However, this calculation is incorrect if the ship cannot reach the point (x_2, y_2). For example, if `x_1 = 0` and `y_1 = 0`, and `x_2 = 1` and `y_2 = 1`, then the minimum number of days required for the ship to reach the point (x_2, y_2) is 2, not 1.

To avoid this error, make sure that the ship can reach the point (x_2, y_2) before calculating the minimum number of days.

### 4. Incorrect handling of the periodic forecast

The forecast is periodic, e.g. the first day wind blows to the side `s_1`, the second day — `s_2`, the n-th day — `s_n` and (n+1)-th day — `s_1` again and so on. However, this does not mean that the ship can always reach the point (x_2, y_2) by following the forecast. For example, if `x_1 = 0`, `y_1 = 0`, `x_2 = 1`, and `y_2 = 1`, and the forecast is `R`, then the ship cannot reach the point (x_2, y_2) by following the forecast.

To avoid this error, make sure that the ship can reach the point (x_2, y_2) by following the forecast before calculating the minimum number of days.

2. **Incorrect variable type**. The variables used in the program must be of the correct type. For example, if a variable is declared as an integer, it cannot be used to store a floating-point number. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when a programmer accidentally misses or adds one to an index or a value. This can lead to the program accessing incorrect data or skipping over instructions.
4. **Arithmetic errors**. Arithmetic errors occur when a programmer makes a mistake in performing a mathematical calculation. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results.
5. **Logic errors**. Logic errors occur when a programmer makes a mistake in the logical flow of the program. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
6. **Memory errors**. Memory errors occur when a programmer attempts to access memory that has not been allocated or that has already been freed. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
7. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads of execution attempt to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
8. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads of execution are each waiting for the other to release a resource. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
9. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities occur when a programmer makes a mistake that allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the program or its data. This can lead to the program being compromised or its data being stolen.
10. **Usability problems**. Usability problems occur when a program is difficult to use or understand. This can lead to users making mistakes or not using the program at all.

3. **Incorrect logic.** The program may contain errors in its logic, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may not consider all possible cases, or it may make incorrect assumptions about the input.
4. **Infinite loop.** The program may enter an infinite loop, which will prevent it from terminating. This can happen if the program contains a bug that causes it to repeatedly execute the same code.
5. **Memory leak.** The program may leak memory, which can eventually lead to the program crashing. This can happen if the program does not free up memory that it no longer needs.
6. **Stack overflow.** The program may overflow the stack, which can also lead to the program crashing. This can happen if the program recursively calls a function too many times.
7. **Race condition.** The program may experience a race condition, which can lead to incorrect results. This can happen if two parts of the program try to access the same data at the same time.
8. **Deadlock.** The program may deadlock, which will prevent it from making any progress. This can happen if two parts of the program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish until the other one does.

CODEFORCES 1219_E. Jumping Transformers

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly and in the correct format. One common mistake is to misread the number of rows and columns in the matrix. Another common mistake is to misread the number of transformers.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer. It is important to make sure that you are printing the output in the correct format. One common mistake is to print the output as a list of integers instead of a single integer.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When dealing with arrays and matrices, it is easy to make off-by-one errors. This can happen when you are indexing into the array or when you are calculating the size of the array. One common mistake is to forget to add 1 to the size of the array when you are calculating the index of the last element.

**4. Arithmetic errors**

When calculating the minimum possible amount of energy wasted, it is important to make sure that you are doing the arithmetic correctly. One common mistake is to forget to carry the carry when adding two integers.

**5. Logical errors**

When solving this problem, it is important to make sure that you are thinking logically about the problem. One common mistake is to assume that the transformers will always be in the same place at the same time. Another common mistake is to assume that the transformers will always move in the same direction.

**6. Time complexity**

CODEFORCES 1304_B. Longest Palindrome

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m. If the input format is incorrect, the program may crash or output incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect string length**. The strings in the input should all have the same length m. If the strings have different lengths, the program may crash or output incorrect results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1328_C. Ternary XOR

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are correctly parsing the input data into the correct data types. For example, if you are expecting an integer but you receive a string, you will need to convert the string into an integer before you can use it in your program.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also very specific. It is important to make sure that you are correctly formatting your output so that it matches the expected format. For example, if you are expected to print two integers separated by a space, you will need to make sure that your code does exactly that.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

One common mistake that programmers make is off-by-one errors. This occurs when you accidentally miscount by one when performing an operation. For example, if you are supposed to add two numbers together but you accidentally add one too many, you will get the wrong answer.

**4. Logical errors**

Another common mistake that programmers make is logical errors. This occurs when you make a mistake in your logic, such as using the wrong variable or forgetting to check for a certain condition. For example, if you are supposed to check if a number is divisible by three but you accidentally check if it is divisible by two, you will get the wrong answer.

**5. Runtime errors**

Runtime errors occur when your program crashes or throws an exception while it is running. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as trying to access a memory address that doesn't exist or dividing by zero. Runtime errors can be very difficult to debug, so it is important to make sure that your code is as error-free as possible.

CODEFORCES 1348_C. Phoenix and Distribution

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong data type. For example, the input may contain a string when the program expects an integer. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program may contain errors in its logic. For example, the program may not correctly account for all possible cases. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. The program may be incorrectly implemented. For example, the program may use inefficient algorithms or data structures. This can lead to the program running slowly or using too much memory.
5. **Incorrect testing**. The program may not be adequately tested. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output when it is used in real-world applications.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to check the data type of the input data and to use the correct data types in the program. The program logic should be carefully reviewed to ensure that it correctly accounts for all possible cases. The program should be implemented using efficient algorithms and data structures. Finally, the program should be adequately tested to ensure that it produces correct output for all possible inputs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1369_A. FashionabLee

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format is specified as follows:

```
The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of polygons in the market. 

Each of the next t lines contains a single integer n_i (3 ≤ n_i ≤ 10^9): it means that the i-th polygon is a regular n_i-sided polygon. 
```

However, a developer may accidentally input a line that does not match this format. For example, the input ```
4
3
4
12
1000000000
a
```

would not be valid, because the last line contains the letter `a` instead of an integer. This would cause the program to crash.

### 2. Incorrect output format

The output format is specified as follows:

```
For each polygon, print YES if it's beautiful or NO otherwise (case insensitive). 
```

However, a developer may accidentally output the wrong format. For example, the output ```
NO
YES
YES
YES
a
```

would not be valid, because the last line contains the letter `a` instead of the word `YES` or `NO`. This would cause the program to receive a incorrect answer verdict.

### 3. Incorrect calculation of the number of sides

The problem states that a regular polygon is beautiful if and only if it has at least one edge parallel to the OX-axis and at least one edge parallel to the OY-axis. However, a developer may accidentally calculate the number of sides incorrectly. For example, the following code would incorrectly calculate the number of sides of a regular polygon with $n$ sides:

```
def get_number_of_sides(n):
  return n // 2
```

This is because the number of sides of a regular polygon is $n$, not $n / 2$. This would cause the program to output incorrect answers.

### 4. Incorrect rotation of the polygon

The problem states that a regular polygon is beautiful if and only if it can be rotated in such a way that at least one of its edges is parallel to the OX-axis and at least one of its edges is parallel to the OY-axis. However, a developer may accidentally rotate the polygon incorrectly. For example, the following code would incorrectly rotate a regular polygon with $n$ sides:

```
def rotate_polygon(polygon, angle):
  for vertex in polygon:
    vertex[0] = vertex[0] * math.cos(angle) - vertex[1] * math.sin(angle)
    vertex[1] = vertex[0] * math.sin(angle) + vertex[1] * math.cos(angle)
```

This is because the correct way to rotate a regular polygon is to rotate each vertex of the polygon by the same angle. This would cause the program to output incorrect answers.

### 5. Incorrect checking of whether the polygon is beautiful

The problem states that a regular polygon is beautiful if and only if it has at least one edge parallel to the OX-axis and at least one edge parallel to the OY-axis. However, a developer may accidentally check whether the polygon is beautiful incorrectly. For example, the following code would incorrectly check whether a regular polygon with $n$ sides is beautiful:

```
def is_polygon_beautiful(polygon):
  for vertex in polygon:
    if vertex[0] == 0 or vertex[1] == 0:
      return True
  return False
```

This is because the correct way to check whether a regular polygon is beautiful is to check whether at least one of its edges is parallel to the OX-axis and at least one of its edges is parallel to the OY-axis. This would cause the program to output incorrect answers.

2. **Incorrect data type.** The input data is given as integers, but it is possible that some of the values will be out of range for the integer data type. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over the input data, it is possible to make a mistake and skip over one or more elements. This could lead to the program missing some of the data or counting it twice.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. This could lead to the program producing incorrect output.
5. **Memory leaks.** The program may not be properly freeing up memory that it is no longer using. This could lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Synchronization errors.** If the program is multi-threaded, it is possible that there will be errors caused by threads accessing shared data at the same time. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
7. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program may contain security vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design the program and test it thoroughly before deploying it to production.

CODEFORCES 1455_C. Ping-pong

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly followed, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect variable declaration**. The variables may not be declared correctly, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if a variable is declared as a string instead of an integer, the program may crash.
3. **Incorrect operator usage**. The operators may be used incorrectly, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the operator `+` is used to add two strings, the program may crash.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the program does not check for boundary conditions, it may crash.
5. **Incorrect output format**. The output format may not be correctly followed, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the output contains a newline character instead of a space character, the program may crash.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format, variable declaration, operator usage, logic, and output format. Additionally, it is important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it produces the correct output for all possible inputs.

CODEFORCES 1479_D. Odd Mineral Resource

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm.** This could lead to incorrect results, as the algorithm would not be able to find all of the cities that are reachable from the starting city.
2. **Incorrect use of the `in` operator.** This could lead to incorrect results, as the operator would not be able to determine whether a particular city is reachable from the starting city.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the DFS algorithm.** This could lead to incorrect results, as the algorithm would not be able to find all of the cities that are reachable from the starting city.
4. **Incorrect use of the `visited` array.** This could lead to incorrect results, as the array would not be able to keep track of which cities have already been visited.
5. **Incorrect implementation of the `count` variable.** This could lead to incorrect results, as the variable would not be able to keep track of the number of times a particular mineral resource appears between two cities.
6. **Incorrect use of the `res` array.** This could lead to incorrect results, as the array would not be able to store the mineral resource that appears an odd number of times between two cities.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1506_C. Double-ended Strings

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of `ord()`**. `ord()` returns the Unicode code point of a character, which is not the same as its index in the string. For example, `ord('a')` returns 97, which is not the same as the index of `'a'` in the string `'hello'` (which is 0).
2. **Incorrect use of `min()`**. `min()` returns the smallest element in a sequence. If the sequence is empty, `min()` raises an error.
3. **Incorrect use of `len()`**. `len()` returns the length of a string. If the string is empty, `len()` returns 0.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. When comparing two strings, it is important to make sure that you are comparing the same number of characters. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
if a == b:
  # Do something
```

This code will only work if the two strings are exactly the same length. If the strings are not the same length, the comparison will fail because the shorter string will be compared to the longer string starting at the first character of the shorter string.
5. **Using the wrong data type**. When working with strings, it is important to use the correct data type. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
a = "hello"
b = 12345

if a == b:
  # Do something
```

This code will fail because the `==` operator cannot compare strings and integers.
6. **Using `startswith()` and `endswith()` incorrectly**. The `startswith()` and `endswith()` methods can be used to check if a string starts with or ends with a given substring. However, it is important to make sure that you are using these methods correctly. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
if a.startswith("hello") and b.endswith("world"):
  # Do something
```

This code will fail because the `startswith()` method checks if the string starts with the given substring, not if the string contains the given substring.
7. **Using `in` incorrectly**. The `in` operator can be used to check if a substring is contained in a string. However, it is important to make sure that you are using this operator correctly. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
if "hello" in a:
  # Do something
```

This code will fail because the `in` operator only checks if the substring is a substring of the string, not if the substring is a prefix or suffix of the string.

Title:
CODEFORCES 160_D. Edges in MST

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of Prim's algorithm.** Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree in a weighted undirected graph. It works by iteratively adding the cheapest edge that connects a vertex in the current spanning tree to a vertex not in the current spanning tree. A common mistake is to incorrectly implement the algorithm, such as by adding an edge to the spanning tree that is not the cheapest edge that connects a vertex in the current spanning tree to a vertex not in the current spanning tree. This can result in the algorithm finding a non-minimum spanning tree.
2. **Using a data structure that is not appropriate for the problem.** The data structure used to represent the graph can have a significant impact on the performance of Prim's algorithm. For example, using an adjacency list to represent the graph can be much faster than using an adjacency matrix.
3. **Not handling degenerate cases correctly.** Prim's algorithm can fail to find a minimum spanning tree if the graph is degenerate, such as if the graph is a tree. In these cases, it is important to handle the degenerate cases correctly, such as by returning an empty set of edges.
4. **Using a non-optimal heuristic.** Prim's algorithm can be improved by using a non-optimal heuristic to choose the next edge to add to the spanning tree. For example, the algorithm can be improved by choosing the edge with the smallest weight that connects a vertex in the current spanning tree to a vertex not in the current spanning tree.
5. **Not terminating the algorithm early.** Prim's algorithm can be terminated early if the desired number of edges have been added to the spanning tree. This can save time, especially if the graph is large.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Carefully review the implementation of Prim's algorithm to ensure that it is correct.
* Use a data structure that is appropriate for the problem.
* Handle degenerate cases correctly.
* Use a non-optimal heuristic to improve the performance of the algorithm.
* Terminate the algorithm early if possible.

Title:
CODEFORCES 180_A. Defragmentation

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input data. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when writing the output data. For example, if you forget to add a newline character at the end of each line, the program will not be able to print the output correctly.
* **Incorrect algorithm:** The algorithm for defragmenting the disk is not trivial, and it is easy to make a mistake when implementing it. For example, if you forget to check for overlapping files, the program will not be able to defragment the disk correctly.
* **Incorrect data:** The data given to the program may be incorrect, for example, it may contain duplicate cluster numbers or negative numbers. If the program does not handle incorrect data correctly, it may crash or produce incorrect output.
* **Runtime errors:** The program may run out of memory or time if it is not written efficiently. This can happen if the program uses too much memory to store the data or if it takes too long to execute the defragmentation algorithm.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the program thoroughly with a variety of different input data sets. Finally, it is important to use efficient algorithms and data structures to minimize the risk of runtime errors.

CODEFORCES 203_B. Game on Paper

Pain points:
**1. Input Format**

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n·n, 105)) — the size of the squared piece of paper and the number of moves, correspondingly.

Then, m lines contain the description of the moves. The i-th line contains two integers xi, yi (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n) — the number of row and column of the square that gets painted on the i-th move.

All numbers on the lines are separated by single spaces. It is guaranteed that all moves are different. The moves are numbered starting from 1 in the order, in which they are given in the input. The columns of the squared piece of paper are numbered starting from 1, from the left to the right. The rows of the squared piece of paper are numbered starting from 1, from top to bottom.

**2. Output Format**

On a single line print the answer to the problem — the minimum number of the move after which the piece of paper has a black square with side 3. If no such move exists, print -1.

**3. Possible Problems**

* The input format is not specified clearly. For example, it is not clear whether the input should be a single line or multiple lines.
* The output format is not specified clearly. For example, it is not clear whether the output should be an integer or a string.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if there is no such move.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input is invalid.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the output is too long.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the output is not in the correct format.

**4. Possible Bugs**

* The program may not read the input correctly.
* The program may not process the input correctly.
* The program may not output the correct answer.
* The program may not handle invalid input correctly.
* The program may not handle errors correctly.
* The program may be too slow.
* The program may take up too much memory.

**5. How to Avoid These Problems**

* Make sure that the input format is clearly specified.
* Make sure that the output format is clearly specified.
* Make sure that the problem statement specifies what to do if there is no such move.
* Make sure that the problem statement specifies what to do if the input is invalid.
* Make sure that the problem statement specifies what to do if the output is too long.
* Make sure that the problem statement specifies what to do if the output is not in the correct format.

Title:
CODEFORCES 228_A. Is your horseshoe on the other hoof?

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain four space-separated integers. However, a developer may accidentally forget to add the space between the integers, or they may accidentally add an extra space. This would cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the program should print a single integer. However, a developer may accidentally print multiple integers, or they may accidentally print a string instead of an integer. This would cause the program to produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The program must correctly determine the minimum number of horseshoes that Valera needs to buy. A developer may make a mistake in their logic, such as forgetting to consider all possible cases. This would cause the program to produce incorrect output.
4. **Memory leaks.** The program must not allocate any memory that it does not need. A developer may accidentally allocate memory that is never freed, which could eventually cause the program to run out of memory.
5. **Race conditions.** The program must not access shared data without first ensuring that it is safe to do so. A developer may accidentally access shared data without first obtaining a lock, which could cause the program to produce incorrect output or crash.
6. **Deadlocks.** The program must not create any deadlocks. A developer may accidentally create a deadlock by creating two or more threads that each wait for the other to finish. This would cause the program to hang indefinitely.
7. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program must not contain any security vulnerabilities. A developer may accidentally introduce a security vulnerability by, for example, allowing users to input arbitrary code. This could allow attackers to take control of the program or steal data.

CODEFORCES 251_D. Two Sets

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement is very clear, but it is easy to make a mistake and misunderstand what it is asking you to do. For example, you might think that you need to find the maximum possible value of x1 + x2, when in reality you need to find the maximum possible value of x2.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution to this problem is relatively straightforward, but there are a few places where you can make mistakes. For example, you might forget to initialize the variables correctly, or you might make a mistake in the logic of your algorithm.
3. **Incorrect test cases.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly. You should test your solution on a variety of different input values, including both small and large inputs.
4. **Incorrect submission.** Once you have verified that your solution is correct, you need to make sure that you submit it correctly. This includes making sure that you follow the submission instructions carefully, and that you include all of the required files.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement:** A developer might think that they need to find the maximum possible value of x1 + x2, when in reality they need to find the maximum possible value of x2. This would result in a solution that always gives Masha the entire collection of numbers, which is not what the problem is asking for.
* **Incorrect implementation of the solution:** A developer might forget to initialize the variables correctly, or they might make a mistake in the logic of their algorithm. For example, they might try to find the maximum value of x1 + x2 by adding all of the numbers in the collection together, which would not give the correct answer.
* **Incorrect test cases:** A developer might only test their solution on a few small input values, which would not be enough to catch all of the bugs. For example, they might only test their solution on inputs where the collection of numbers is already sorted, which would not test the case where the numbers are not sorted.
* **Incorrect submission:** A developer might forget to include all of the required files, or they might not follow the submission instructions carefully. This could result in their solution being rejected by the judge.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs that developers encounter when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 276_E. Little Girl and Problem on Trees

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the BFS algorithm.** The BFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that can be used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. However, if the implementation is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results. For example, the following implementation of the BFS algorithm will not work correctly:

```
def bfs(graph, start):
  visited = set()
  queue = [start]
  while queue:
    node = queue.pop()
    visited.add(node)
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
      if neighbor not in visited:
        queue.append(neighbor)

# This implementation will not work correctly because it does not check if the queue is empty before popping an element. This can lead to the algorithm looping forever if the graph is cyclic.

2. **Incorrect use of the DFS algorithm.** The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that can be used to find all the connected components in a graph. However, if the implementation is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results. For example, the following implementation of the DFS algorithm will not work correctly:

```
def dfs(graph, start):
  visited = set()
  stack = [start]
  while stack:
    node = stack.pop()
    visited.add(node)
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
      if neighbor not in visited:
        stack.append(neighbor)

# This implementation will not work correctly because it does not check if the stack is empty before popping an element. This can lead to the algorithm looping forever if the graph is cyclic.

3. **Incorrect use of the Union-Find algorithm.** The Union-Find algorithm is a data structure that can be used to find the connected components in a graph. However, if the implementation is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results. For example, the following implementation of the Union-Find algorithm will not work correctly:

```
def union(p, q):
  root1 = find(p)
  root2 = find(q)
  if root1 != root2:
    parent[root2] = root1

# This implementation will not work correctly because it does not check if the two nodes are already in the same component. This can lead to the algorithm merging two different components together.

4. **Incorrect use of the Disjoint-Set data structure.** The Disjoint-Set data structure is a data structure that can be used to represent a collection of disjoint sets. However, if the implementation is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results. For example, the following implementation of the Disjoint-Set data structure will not work correctly:

```
class DisjointSet:

  def __init__(self, n):
    self.parent = [i for i in range(n)]

  def find(self, x):
    if self.parent[x] != x:
      self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
    return self.parent[x]

  def union(self, x, y):
    x_root = self.find(x)
    y_root = self.find(y)
    self.parent[x_root] = y_root

# This implementation will not work correctly because it does not check if the two nodes are already in the same set. This can lead to the algorithm merging two different sets together.

5. **Incorrect use of the Kruskal's algorithm.** Kruskal's algorithm is an algorithm that can be used to find a minimum spanning tree in a graph. However, if the implementation is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results. For example, the following implementation of Kruskal's algorithm will not work correctly:

```
def kruskal(graph):
  edges = sorted(graph.edges, key=lambda e: e[2])
  mst = []
  for edge in edges:
    if find(edge[0]) != find(edge[1]):
      union(edge[0], edge[1])
      mst.append(edge)
  return mst

# This implementation will not work correctly because it does not check if the graph is connected. This can lead to the algorithm returning a minimum spanning tree that is not connected.

CODEFORCES 29_B. Traffic Lights

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when typing it in. For example, if you forget to put a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum time.** The minimum time to get from point A to point B is the time it takes to travel the distance from A to the traffic lights, plus the time it takes to wait for the green light, plus the time it takes to travel the distance from the traffic lights to point B. It's important to make sure that you calculate each of these times correctly.
3. **Inaccurate output.** The output for this problem must have a relative or absolute error less than 10-6. This means that the output must be accurate to within 0.000001%. It's important to make sure that your program is producing accurate output.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that can occur when programming. This type of error occurs when you forget to add or subtract one from a variable. For example, if you're calculating the distance from point A to point B, you might forget to subtract 1 from the distance to account for the fact that the car is already at point A.
5. **Indexing errors.** Indexing errors occur when you access a variable with an index that is out of bounds. For example, if you're trying to access the first element of an array, but the array is empty, you'll get an indexing error.
6. **Null pointer exceptions.** Null pointer exceptions occur when you try to access a variable that has not been initialized. For example, if you try to print the value of a variable that has not been assigned a value, you'll get a null pointer exception.
7. **Arithmetic overflow errors.** Arithmetic overflow errors occur when you try to perform an arithmetic operation on two numbers that are too large. For example, if you try to add two numbers that are both larger than the maximum value of an integer, you'll get an arithmetic overflow error.
8. **Floating-point errors.** Floating-point errors occur when you perform floating-point arithmetic. These errors are caused by the fact that floating-point numbers are not represented exactly in computers. For example, the floating-point number 0.1 is actually represented as 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625. This means that when you perform floating-point arithmetic, you may get slightly different results than you would expect.
9. **Divide by zero errors.** Divide by zero errors occur when you try to divide a number by zero. This is an illegal operation, and it will cause your program to crash.
10. **Stack overflow errors.** Stack overflow errors occur when your program uses up too much stack space. This can happen when your program has too many recursive calls, or when your program allocates too much memory on the stack.

CODEFORCES 322_E. Ciel the Commander

Pain points:
1. **Inconsistent input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 105) followed by `n - 1` lines, each of which contains two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`, `a` ≠ `b`). However, it is possible that the input format is inconsistent, e.g., the first line contains `n` followed by `n - 1` lines, each of which contains three integers. In this case, the program should raise an error.
2. **Invalid input.** The input format specifies that the given graph will be a tree. However, it is possible that the input graph is not a tree, e.g., there is a cycle in the graph. In this case, the program should output `"Impossible!"`.
3. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the output should be a line containing `n` space-separated characters, where the `i`-th character is the rank of the officer in the city with number `i`. However, it is possible that the output format is incorrect, e.g., the output contains more than `n` characters. In this case, the program should raise an error.
4. **Incorrect solution.** Even if the input format and output format are correct, it is still possible that the program outputs an incorrect solution. For example, the program may output a solution that does not satisfy the given constraints, e.g., two officers with the same rank are not connected by a path. In this case, the program should output `"Impossible!"`.
5. **Other bugs.** There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the program may not handle overflow or underflow correctly, or it may not be efficient enough.

CODEFORCES 347_C. Alice and Bob

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain an integer n, and the second line should contain n space-separated integers. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the program should print a single line with the winner's name. If the output format is not correct, the program will not be accepted by the judge.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program must be correct in order to correctly determine the winner of the game. There are a few possible ways to implement the logic, but the most common approach is to use a greedy algorithm. A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that makes the best possible decision at each step, without considering the future consequences. In this case, the greedy algorithm would choose the two integers in the set that have the smallest absolute difference, and then add their absolute difference to the set.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a programmer forgets to add or subtract one from a variable. In this problem, an off-by-one error could occur when the program is determining the smallest absolute difference between two integers in the set.
5. **ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.** An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs when a programmer attempts to access an element of an array that does not exist. In this problem, an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException could occur if the program tries to access an element of the set that is greater than or equal to the number of elements in the set.
6. **NullPointerException.** A NullPointerException occurs when a programmer attempts to access a null object. In this problem, a NullPointerException could occur if the program tries to access an element of the set that has not been initialized.
7. **Stack overflow.** A stack overflow occurs when a program calls a function so many times that the stack becomes full. In this problem, a stack overflow could occur if the program uses a recursive algorithm to solve the problem.
8. **Time complexity.** The time complexity of the program is the amount of time it takes to run the program. In this problem, the time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the set. This is because the program must iterate through the set of n elements twice, once to find the two integers with the smallest absolute difference, and once to add their absolute difference to the set.
9. **Space complexity.** The space complexity of the program is the amount of memory it uses to run the program. In this problem, the space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the set. This is because the program must store the set of n elements in memory.

CODEFORCES 370_D. Broken Monitor

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when parsing it. For example, if you forget to add a space between the two numbers in the first line, the program will crash.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. When processing the input, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one or more characters. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be carefully designed to ensure that it finds the smallest possible frame. There are many ways to do this, and it is important to choose the most efficient one.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program must be careful not to allocate more memory than it needs. This can lead to a crash or other problems.
5. **Synchronization issues**. If the program is multi-threaded, it is important to ensure that the threads do not interfere with each other. This can be difficult to do correctly, and it is easy to make mistakes.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program must be carefully designed to avoid any security vulnerabilities. This includes things like ensuring that the input is properly sanitized and that the program does not allow attackers to execute arbitrary code.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

CODEFORCES 392_A. Blocked Points

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be `n`, an integer in the range `[0, 4 * 10^7]`. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer, the minimum number of points that should be blocked. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not compile.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm should find the minimum number of points that should be blocked to ensure that no special point is 4-connected to some non-special point. If the algorithm is incorrect, the program will output an incorrect answer.
4. **Runtime error**. The program may run out of memory or time if the input is large.
5. **Logic error**. The program may make incorrect assumptions about the input or the output.
6. **User error**. The user may enter incorrect input or use the program incorrectly.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the program on a variety of inputs to ensure that it is working correctly.

CODEFORCES 415_B. Mashmokh and Tokens

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains integers that can be very large. So we need to use a data type that can store such large integers. For example, we can use `long` in Java or `int64` in Python.

**2. Not handling the edge cases**

The input contains some edge cases. For example, the input may contain a negative integer. We need to handle these edge cases properly.

**3. Making a mistake in the algorithm**

The algorithm for solving this problem is not very difficult. However, it is easy to make a mistake in the implementation. We need to be careful when writing the code.

**4. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code before submitting it. This will help us to catch any bugs that we may have missed.

**5. Not using a debugger**

A debugger can be very helpful in debugging problems. We can use a debugger to step through the code and see where the problem is occurring.

Title:
CODEFORCES 441_E. Valera and Number

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect calculation of the expected value.** The expected value of a random variable is a weighted average of its possible values, where the weights are the probabilities of those values occurring. In this problem, the possible values of the random variable `s` are the integers from 0 to `x`, and the probability of each value occurring is the probability that the program will stop after `k` steps with `s` bits in the binary representation of `a`. This probability can be calculated by multiplying the probability that `a` is a power of 2 by the probability that the program will stop after `k` steps with `s` bits in the binary representation of `a`. However, it is easy to make a mistake when calculating these probabilities.
2. **Incorrect use of the binomial distribution.** The binomial distribution is a probability distribution that describes the number of successes in a sequence of independent experiments, each of which has a constant probability of success. In this problem, the number of successes is the number of times the program doubles `a` and the probability of success is `p`. However, it is important to remember that the binomial distribution only applies when the experiments are independent. In this problem, the experiments are not independent because the value of `a` after each experiment affects the probability of success in the next experiment.
3. **Incorrect use of the geometric distribution.** The geometric distribution is a probability distribution that describes the number of failures until the first success in a sequence of independent experiments, each of which has a constant probability of success. In this problem, the number of failures is the number of times the program increases `s` by 1 and the probability of success is `1 - p`. However, it is important to remember that the geometric distribution only applies when the experiments are independent. In this problem, the experiments are not independent because the value of `s` after each experiment affects the probability of success in the next experiment.
4. **Incorrect use of the Poisson distribution.** The Poisson distribution is a probability distribution that describes the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time or space. In this problem, the number of events is the number of times the program increases `s` by 1 and the interval of time or space is `k` steps. However, it is important to remember that the Poisson distribution only applies when the events are independent. In this problem, the events are not independent because the value of `s` after each event affects the probability of the next event.
5. **Incorrect use of the normal distribution.** The normal distribution is a probability distribution that describes the distribution of a random variable that is approximately bell-shaped. In this problem, the random variable is the number of bits in the binary representation of `a` after `k` steps. However, it is important to remember that the normal distribution only applies when the random variable is approximately bell-shaped. In this problem, the distribution of the number of bits in the binary representation of `a` after `k` steps is not necessarily bell-shaped.

Title:
CODEFORCES 560_A. Currency System in Geraldion

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data contains integers, so the developer should use the `int` data type to store the values of the banknotes. Using a floating-point data type like `float` or `double` could lead to incorrect results.

**2. Not considering all possible cases**

The problem statement states that "Geraldionians cannot express a certain sum of money with any set of banknotes". This means that the minimum unfortunate sum must be less than the sum of all the banknotes. The developer should make sure to check this condition before printing the output.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The naive algorithm for finding the minimum unfortunate sum is to iterate over all possible sums and check if each one is unfortunate. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is too slow for large values of n. A more efficient algorithm is to use dynamic programming.

**4. Not handling errors correctly**

The input data may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers that are too large. The developer should make sure to handle these errors correctly.

**5. Not testing the code thoroughly**

It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly for all possible inputs. This includes testing for invalid inputs, as well as inputs that produce the minimum unfortunate sum.

CODEFORCES 586_C. Gennady the Dentist

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type.** The input data is a list of integers, but the developer may accidentally use a different data type, such as a string or a float. This will cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** The developer may accidentally miscalculate the index of an element in the list, causing the program to skip or repeat an element. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program, such as forgetting to check for a certain condition or using the wrong algorithm. This can also lead to incorrect results.
4. **Memory leaks.** The developer may accidentally create a memory leak, which is a situation where memory is allocated but never freed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
5. **Synchronization errors.** The developer may accidentally create a synchronization error, which is a situation where two or more parts of the program try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to data corruption or deadlocks.
6. **Security vulnerabilities.** The developer may accidentally introduce a security vulnerability, such as a buffer overflow or a SQL injection. This can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or the data it is processing.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully check their code for errors before deploying it to production. They should also use a debugger to help them track down any problems that occur.

CODEFORCES 67_B. Restoration of the Permutation

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. This can lead to the program reading the input incorrectly and producing incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not strictly followed. For example, the numbers in the output may not be separated by spaces, or the numbers may not be in the correct order. This can lead to the program being graded incorrectly.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic of the program may be incorrect. For example, the program may not be able to correctly find the lexicographically smallest permutation. This can lead to the program producing incorrect output.

**4. Runtime errors**

The program may not be able to run to completion due to a runtime error. For example, the program may run out of memory, or it may encounter a segmentation fault. This can lead to the program being graded incorrectly.

**5. Incorrect data structures**

The program may use incorrect data structures. For example, the program may use a linked list to store the permutations, when a hash table would be more efficient. This can lead to the program running slowly and producing incorrect output.

**6. Inefficient algorithms**

The program may use inefficient algorithms. For example, the program may use a brute-force algorithm to find the lexicographically smallest permutation, when a more efficient algorithm exists. This can lead to the program running slowly and producing incorrect output.

**7. Unclear code**

The code may be unclear and difficult to understand. This can make it difficult for other developers to maintain the code, and it can also make it more difficult to find and fix bugs.

**8. Lack of unit tests**

The program may not have unit tests. Unit tests are essential for ensuring that the program is working correctly. Without unit tests, it is more difficult to find and fix bugs.

**9. Lack of documentation**

CODEFORCES 702_B. Powers of Two

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the binary search algorithm.** The binary search algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that can be used to find the position of a given element in a sorted array. However, if the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect, it may not find the correct position of the element, or it may find the position of an incorrect element.
2. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. However, if the divisor is not a power of 2, the modulo operator may not return the correct remainder.
3. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** Overflow occurs when a numerical value exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by a given data type. If overflow occurs, the resulting value may be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect use of pointers.** Pointers are variables that store the address of another variable. If pointers are not used correctly, they can lead to errors such as accessing invalid memory or modifying data that was not intended to be modified.
5. **Incorrect use of dynamic memory allocation.** Dynamic memory allocation is used to allocate memory for variables that are not known at compile time. If dynamic memory allocation is not used correctly, it can lead to memory leaks or segmentation faults.
6. **Incorrect error handling.** It is important to handle errors gracefully in order to prevent the program from crashing. If errors are not handled correctly, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
Test inputs:
```
# 1. Incorrect implementation of the binary search algorithm
n = 5

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not as described in the problem statement. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the ray's path.** The ray's path is calculated by taking into account the angle of incidence and reflection. If this calculation is incorrect, the program will produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement specifies that the ray will stop at any of the four corners. The program must handle these cases correctly, or it will produce incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for tracing the ray must be implemented correctly, or the program will produce incorrect output.
5. **Incorrect testing.** The program must be tested thoroughly to ensure that it produces the correct output for all possible inputs. If the program is not tested thoroughly, it is likely to contain bugs that will not be found until it is deployed in production.

Title:
CODEFORCES 746_C. Tram

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect variable type.** The variables used in the program must be of the correct type. For example, if a variable is declared as an integer but is assigned a floating-point number, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program must be correct. For example, if the program is supposed to find the minimum of two numbers, but it instead finds the maximum, the program will give the wrong answer.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors occur when the programmer forgets to add or subtract one from a variable. For example, if the program is supposed to find the number of elements in an array, but it instead counts one less element, the program will give the wrong answer.
5. **Infinite loops.** Infinite loops occur when the program enters a loop that never terminates. For example, if the program is supposed to print the numbers from 1 to 10, but it instead prints the numbers from 1 to infinity, the program will run forever.
6. **Memory leaks.** Memory leaks occur when the program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
7. **Race conditions.** Race conditions occur when two or more parts of the program try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program giving the wrong answer or crashing.
8. **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks occur when two or more parts of the program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish because it is waiting for the other. This can lead to the program running forever or crashing.
9. **Security vulnerabilities.** Security vulnerabilities occur when the program allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system. For example, if the program is supposed to accept user input, but it does not properly validate the input, the attacker could enter malicious code that could be executed by the program.
10. **Usability problems.** Usability problems occur when the program is difficult to use or understand. For example, if the program's user interface is confusing or the program's documentation is incomplete, the user may not be able to use the program effectively.
Test inputs:
```
#include <stdio.h>

Title:
CODEFORCES 769_C. Cycle In Maze

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be exactly as specified in the problem statement. For example, if you forget to include a space between two integers, the input will be interpreted incorrectly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be exactly as specified in the problem statement. For example, if you print the answer in all capital letters, it will be incorrect.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When you're iterating over a list or array, it's easy to make a mistake and miss one element or include one too many. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect boundary conditions**. When you're checking for boundary conditions, it's important to make sure that you're checking all of the possible cases. For example, if you're checking if a number is positive, you need to check for both 0 and negative numbers.
5. **Logic errors**. This is the most common type of error, and it can be caused by a variety of things, such as using the wrong variable, forgetting to initialize a variable, or making a mistake in your calculations.
6. **Runtime errors**. These errors occur when your program runs into a problem that it can't handle. For example, if you try to divide by zero, your program will crash.
7. **Memory errors**. These errors occur when your program runs out of memory. This can happen if you allocate too much memory or if you don't free up memory that you're no longer using.
8. **Synchronization errors**. These errors occur when multiple threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to data corruption or incorrect results.
9. **Security errors**. These errors can allow attackers to gain access to your program or your data. For example, if you don't properly sanitize user input, an attacker could inject malicious code into your program.
10. **Other errors**. There are a number of other errors that can occur, such as compiler errors, linker errors, and operating system errors.

Title:
CODEFORCES 793_C. Mice problem

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly. For example, if you forget to read the first line of input, your program will not work correctly.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem must be a single number. If you output anything else, your program will not be accepted. For example, if you output a string instead of a number, your program will not work correctly.

**3. Undefined behavior**

Some of the code in this problem is undefined behavior. This means that the compiler is not required to give you any particular output if you run your program with this code. For example, if you divide by zero, the compiler is not required to give you an error message. This can lead to problems if you are not careful.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that can occur when you are programming. This type of error occurs when you forget to increment or decrement a variable by one. For example, if you are counting the number of elements in an array, and you forget to increment the counter by one, you will end up with one less element than you expected.

**5. Arithmetic overflow**

Arithmetic overflow occurs when you perform an arithmetic operation on two numbers that are too large for the computer to represent. For example, if you add two integers that are each larger than 2147483647, the result will be an integer that is less than 2147483647. This can lead to problems if you are not careful.

**6. Floating-point errors**

Floating-point errors are a type of error that can occur when you are working with floating-point numbers. Floating-point numbers are not exact representations of real numbers, and this can lead to errors when you are performing calculations on them. For example, if you add two floating-point numbers that are very close to each other, the result may not be exactly equal to the sum of the two numbers.

**7. Memory leaks**

Memory leaks occur when you allocate memory for a variable and then forget to free it when you are finished with it. This can lead to problems if your program runs out of memory.

**8. Race conditions**

Race conditions occur when two or more threads of execution try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to problems if the data is not protected properly.

**9. Deadlocks**

Deadlocks occur when two or more threads of execution are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can lead to programs that hang indefinitely.

Title:
CODEFORCES 813_F. Bipartite Checking

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the graph data structure.** The graph must be represented in a way that allows for efficient queries about whether two vertices are connected by an edge. A common mistake is to use an adjacency list, where each vertex stores a list of its adjacent vertices. This data structure is not efficient for bipartite checking, because it requires iterating over all of the adjacent vertices of a vertex to check whether it is connected to a vertex of the opposite color. A better data structure for bipartite checking is an adjacency matrix, where each entry in the matrix represents whether there is an edge between the two corresponding vertices.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the bipartite checking algorithm.** The bipartite checking algorithm is a recursive algorithm that works by assigning colors to the vertices of the graph. The algorithm starts by assigning a different color to each of the two vertices in the first edge of the graph. It then recursively assigns colors to the remaining vertices, one at a time. At each step, the algorithm checks whether the vertex it is currently considering is already colored. If it is, the algorithm checks whether the vertex is connected to a vertex of the opposite color. If it is not, the algorithm assigns a new color to the vertex. The algorithm terminates when all of the vertices have been colored. If the algorithm terminates without finding any conflicts, then the graph is bipartite. A common mistake in the implementation of the bipartite checking algorithm is to forget to check whether the vertex is already colored before assigning it a new color. This can lead to the algorithm assigning the same color to two adjacent vertices, which will cause the algorithm to terminate with a false negative.
3. **Incorrect handling of queries that add or remove edges.** When a query adds or removes an edge from the graph, the bipartite checking algorithm must be updated accordingly. A common mistake is to forget to update the adjacency matrix or adjacency list when an edge is added or removed. This can lead to the algorithm incorrectly reporting that the graph is bipartite when it is not, or vice versa.
4. **Incorrect handling of multiple queries.** The bipartite checking algorithm is a recursive algorithm, which means that it can be called multiple times on the same graph. A common mistake is to forget to initialize the graph before calling the algorithm on it for the first time. This can lead to the algorithm incorrectly reporting that the graph is bipartite when it is not, or vice versa.
5. **Incorrect output format.** The output of the bipartite checking algorithm must be in the format specified in the problem statement. A common mistake is to forget to print the newline character after each output line. This can cause the output to be incorrect.

Title:
CODEFORCES 85_A. Domino

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a single integer n, representing the number of columns in the field. If the input is not in the correct format, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be four lines, each containing n characters. The characters in each line should represent the colors of the dominoes in that row. The characters should be lowercase Latin letters, and no two dominoes of the same color should be side-by-side. If the output is not in the correct format, the program will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.
3. **Incorrect tiling.** The tiling must satisfy the following conditions:
    * Each of the n-1 potential vertical cuts must intersect at least one domino.
    * No two dominoes in the tiling may overlap.
    * Each square of the field must be covered by exactly one domino.
    * Dominoes may be rotated, but they may not be flipped.
If the tiling does not satisfy any of these conditions, the program will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.
4. **Inefficient solution.** The program should be as efficient as possible. A naive solution that simply tries all possible tilings will not be fast enough to pass the time limit. A more efficient solution would be to use a dynamic programming approach.
5. **Bugs in the code.** The program may contain bugs that cause it to crash or produce incorrect output. These bugs can be caused by a variety of factors, such as incorrect logic, typos, or memory errors. It is important to carefully test the program to ensure that it is free of bugs before submitting it to Codeforces.
Test inputs:
**1. Incorrect input format**

```

This input is not in the correct format, because it does not contain a single integer n. The program will crash when it tries to read this input.

**2. Incorrect output format**

```
a1a2a3a4
b1b2b3b4
c1c2c3c4
d1d2d3d4
```

This output is not in the correct format, because it does not contain four lines, each containing n characters. The program will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.

**3. Incorrect tiling**

```
a1a2a3a4
b1b2b3b4
c1c2c3c4
d1d2d3d4
```

This tiling is incorrect, because it does not satisfy the following conditions:

    * Each of the n-1 potential vertical cuts must intersect at least one domino.
    * No two dominoes in the tiling may overlap.
    * Each square of the field must be covered by exactly one domino.
    * Dominoes may be rotated, but they may not be flipped.

The program will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.

**4. Inefficient solution**

```
def tiling(n):
    if n == 1:
        return "a"
    else:
        return tiling(n - 1) + tiling(n - 1)


n = int(input())
print(tiling(n))
```

This solution is inefficient, because it simply tries all possible tilings. A more efficient solution would be to use a dynamic programming approach.

**5. Bugs in the code**

```
def tiling(n):
    if n == 1:
        return "a"
    else:
        return tiling(n - 1) + tiling(n - 1)


n = int(input())
print(tiling(n))
```

This code contains a bug, because it tries to access the tiling function with an argument of n - 1, even though n is 1. The program will crash when it tries to run this code.

CODEFORCES 930_C. Teodor is not a liar!

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if the output contains a character that is not a digit, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect data type**. The data types used in the program must be compatible with the input and output formats. For example, if the input contains a string, the program must use a string data type to store the input.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are common in programming, and they can lead to incorrect results. For example, if a program is supposed to iterate over a list of numbers, but the loop starts at the wrong index, the program will miss some of the numbers in the list.
5. **Logic errors**. Logic errors are errors in the logic of the program. For example, if a program is supposed to find the maximum value in a list, but the program does not account for the possibility of a tie, the program will return the wrong value.
6. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
7. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more parts of a program try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
8. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more parts of a program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish because it is waiting for the other part to finish. This can lead to the program running indefinitely or crashing.
9. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can occur when a program is not properly protected from unauthorized access or modification. This can allow attackers to gain access to sensitive data or take control of the program.
10. **Performance issues**. Performance issues can occur when a program is not written efficiently. This can lead to the program running slowly or using too much memory.

CODEFORCES 958_D1. Hyperspace Jump (easy)

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly, and that you are not accidentally skipping or misinterpreting any of the input values. For example, if you are reading the input from a file, you need to make sure that the file is correctly formatted and that you are not accidentally reading in extra data from the file.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also very specific. It is important to make sure that you are printing the output in the correct format, and that you are not accidentally printing any extra data. For example, you should not print a newline character at the end of your output, and you should not print any spaces between the output values.

**3. Floating-point arithmetic errors**

When working with floating-point numbers, it is important to be aware of the possibility of rounding errors. This is especially important when you are comparing two floating-point numbers, or when you are performing arithmetic operations on floating-point numbers. For example, if you are comparing two floating-point numbers, you should not simply check if they are equal, because they may be slightly different due to rounding errors. Instead, you should use a more robust comparison method, such as the `abs()` function.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that can occur when you are iterating over a list or a range of numbers. This type of error occurs when you forget to increment or decrement the index by one, which can result in incorrect results. For example, if you are iterating over a list of numbers, and you forget to increment the index by one, you will end up skipping the last element in the list.

**5. Undefined behavior**

Undefined behavior is a type of error that can occur when you are using a programming language in a way that is not specified by the language's specification. This type of error can be very difficult to debug, because it can be caused by a variety of different factors. For example, if you are using a compiler flag that is not supported by your compiler, you may experience undefined behavior.

**6. Memory errors**

Memory errors can occur when you allocate too much memory, or when you free memory that is still in use. This type of error can cause your program to crash, or it can lead to security vulnerabilities. For example, if you allocate too much memory, your program may run out of memory and crash.

**7. Race conditions**

Race conditions can occur when two or more threads are trying to access the same data at the same time. This type of error can cause your program to produce incorrect results, or it can even cause your program to crash. For example, if two threads are trying to update the same variable at the same time, the final value of the variable may be incorrect.

Title:
CODEFORCES 984_C. Finite or not?

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains very large integers, so you need to use a data type that can store them. For example, you can use `int64` in C++ or `BigInteger` in Java.

**2. Not handling special cases**

The problem states that the denominator `q` can be 1. In this case, the fraction `p/q` is equal to `p`, which is always finite. You need to handle this special case.

**3. Using floating-point arithmetic**

Floating-point arithmetic is not precise, so it can lead to incorrect results. For example, the fraction `1/3` in base 2 is represented as `0.01001100110011...` in floating-point arithmetic. This means that the fraction is not finite, even though it is actually finite. You should avoid using floating-point arithmetic for this problem.

**4. Not using the right algorithm**

The naive algorithm for checking if a fraction is finite is to convert it to a decimal representation and then check if the decimal representation is finite. This algorithm is very inefficient, as it requires converting the fraction to a decimal representation, which can be very time-consuming.

A more efficient algorithm is to use the following theorem:

> A fraction `p/q` is finite if and only if `p` is divisible by `q`.

This theorem allows us to check if a fraction is finite by simply checking if `p` is divisible by `q`. This algorithm is much more efficient than the naive algorithm.

**5. Not handling errors**

The input may contain invalid data, such as negative integers or fractions with a zero denominator. You need to handle these errors correctly.

HACKEREARTH pair-sums

Pain points:
1. **Using an incorrect data type for `K`**. The input specifies that `K` can be up to `2 * 10^6`, so you need to use an integer type that can store that large of a value. If you use an integer type that is too small, you will get an overflow error.
2. **Not using a stable sort**. When you sort the array, you need to use a stable sort algorithm. This means that the order of equal elements in the array must be preserved after sorting. If you use an unstable sort algorithm, you may get incorrect results.
3. **Using the wrong algorithm**. The most efficient way to solve this problem is to use a hash table. A hash table is a data structure that can store key-value pairs. In this problem, the keys are the elements of the array and the values are the indices of the elements in the array. When you iterate over the array, you can check if the current element is in the hash table. If it is, then you have found a pair of elements that sum to `K`. If it is not, then you can add the current element to the hash table.
4. **Not handling edge cases**. There are a few edge cases that you need to handle when solving this problem. For example, what if the array is empty? What if `K` is not a valid number? What if there are no pairs of elements that sum to `K`? You need to make sure that your code handles all of these cases correctly.
5. **Making a mistake in your code**. This is always a possibility, even for experienced programmers. It's important to carefully check your code for errors before submitting it.

ATCODER p02702 AtCoder Beginner Contest 164 - Multiple of 2019

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input string `S` can have a maximum length of 200000. If we use an integer to store the value of `S`, we will get a `ValueError`.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the number of pairs of integers (i,j) (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ |S|) that satisfy the condition. A naive algorithm would be to iterate over all possible pairs of integers (i,j) and check if the i-th through j-th characters of S form an integer that is a multiple of 2019. This algorithm would have a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of S.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

The problem states that S is a string consisting of digits from `1` through `9`. We need to make sure that we handle edge cases such as S being empty or S containing only one digit.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The problem asks us to print the number of pairs of integers (i,j) (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ |S|) that satisfy the condition. We need to make sure that we print the output in the correct format.

Title:
ATCODER p02831 AtCoder Beginner Contest 148 - Snack

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input constraints state that `A` and `B` are integers between 1 and 10^5. However, if you accidentally use a data type that is smaller than an integer, such as a float, you may get incorrect results. For example, if you use a float to store `A`, and `A` is equal to 10^5, the float will be rounded down to 10^4. This will cause your program to output the wrong answer.

**2. Not handling the case where `A` and `B` are equal**

The problem states that `A` and `B` are not equal. However, if you accidentally assume that they are equal, your program will not work correctly. For example, if `A` and `B` are both equal to 5, your program will output 5, which is not the correct answer.

**3. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a simple algorithm that takes O(log(A+B)) time. However, if you use a more inefficient algorithm, such as a brute-force algorithm, your program will run slower than necessary.

**4. Not handling errors correctly**

The problem does not specify what should happen if the input is invalid. If you do not handle errors correctly, your program may crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the input is `A B`, where `B` is less than `A`, your program should print an error message.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it to the judge. This will help you catch any bugs that you may have missed. You can test your code by using a variety of input values, including both valid and invalid input.

Title:
ATCODER p02968 AtCoder Grand Contest 036 - Square Constraints

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect modulo operation**

When computing the number of permutations that satisfy the condition, it is important to use the correct modulo operation. For example, if you are computing the number of permutations modulo 100, you cannot simply divide the number of permutations by 100 and take the remainder. This is because the remainder of a division operation is not always the same as the modulo operation. For example, 101 / 100 has a remainder of 1, but 101 % 100 has a value of 1.

To correctly compute the number of permutations modulo 100, you would need to use the following formula:

```
num_permutations % 100
```

**2. Using an incorrect range for the loop**

When iterating over the permutations, it is important to use the correct range for the loop. For example, if you are computing the number of permutations of the numbers from 0 to 9, you cannot simply iterate from 0 to 9. This is because the number of permutations of the numbers from 0 to 9 is actually 10!, which is greater than 9.

To correctly compute the number of permutations, you would need to use the following range for the loop:

```
for i in range(0, 10):
```

**3. Using an incorrect formula for the number of permutations**

The formula for the number of permutations of a set of n elements is n!. However, this formula is only valid if the elements in the set are all distinct. In the problem statement, the elements in the set are not all distinct. For example, the set {0, 1, 2, 3} has 4 elements, but there are only 3! = 6 permutations of this set.

To correctly compute the number of permutations in this problem, you would need to use the following formula:

```
num_permutations = (2N)! / ((N!)^2)
```

**4. Using an incorrect value for M**

The value of M in the problem statement is the modulus that the number of permutations should be computed modulo. It is important to use the correct value for M, otherwise the answer will be incorrect.

For example, if the value of M is 100, but you accidentally use the value of 101, the answer will be incorrect. This is because the number of permutations of the numbers from 0 to 99 is actually 100!, which is greater than 101.

To correctly compute the number of permutations, you would need to use the correct value for M.

Title:
ATCODER p03103 AtCoder Beginner Contest 121 - Energy Drink Collector

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input consists of integers, so it is important to use the correct data type to store them. For example, if you use `int` to store a value that is larger than `int` can represent, you will get an overflow error.

**2. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement specifies that `M` must be at least 1, but your code may not check for this. If `M` is less than 1, your code will likely crash.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The problem statement gives a specific algorithm for finding the minimum amount of money needed to buy `M` cans of energy drinks. Your code must implement this algorithm correctly.

**4. Not using efficient algorithms**

The problem can be solved in O(N) time, but your code may take longer if you use a less efficient algorithm.

**5. Not using the right data structures**

The problem can be solved using a simple array to store the data. However, your code may be slower if you use a more complex data structure.

**6. Not using unit tests**

It is important to write unit tests to verify that your code is correct. This will help you catch bugs early and prevent them from causing problems in production.

Title:
ATCODER p03567 CODE FESTIVAL 2017 qual C - Can you get AC?

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input string S is a string of uppercase English letters. If the developer uses the wrong data type to store S, such as an integer or a floating-point number, the program will not work correctly.

**2. Not checking for the length of the input string**

The input string S must be at least 2 characters long. If the developer does not check for the length of the input string, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

**3. Not checking for the contents of the input string**

The input string S must contain the characters A and C. If the developer does not check for the contents of the input string, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

**4. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The correct algorithm for solving this problem is to iterate through the input string S and check if each substring of length 2 contains the characters A and C. If a substring that contains the characters A and C is found, the program should output Yes. Otherwise, the program should output No.

**5. Not handling errors correctly**

If the input string S is not valid, the program should handle the error gracefully. For example, the program could output an error message and then exit.

Title:
ATCODER p03722 AtCoder Beginner Contest 061 - Score Attack

Pain points:
**1. Wrong input format**

The input format is not correctly parsed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input format is `N M a_1 b_1 c_1 a_2 b_2 c_2`, the second `a_2` will be parsed as the first `c_1`.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The data type of the input values may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input value `1 2 3` is parsed as `1, 2, 3`, the third value `3` will be interpreted as a string instead of an integer.

**3. Undefined behavior**

The program may contain undefined behavior, which may lead to incorrect results or even crashes. For example, if the program tries to divide by zero, it will crash.

**4. Memory leaks**

The program may not release memory that it has allocated, which may lead to a memory leak. A memory leak can eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash.

**5. Race conditions**

The program may not be thread-safe, which may lead to incorrect results or even crashes. For example, if two threads try to access the same data at the same time, the results may be incorrect.

**6. Deadlocks**

The program may deadlock, which means that it will stop responding and the user will not be able to do anything. A deadlock can occur when two threads are waiting for each other to release a lock.

**7. Security vulnerabilities**

The program may contain security vulnerabilities, which may allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system. For example, if the program does not properly validate user input, an attacker may be able to inject malicious code into the program.

ATCODER p03883 CODE FESTIVAL 2016 Grand Final(Parallel) - Intervals

Pain points:
**1. Not handling the case where all intervals are overlapping.**

In the example input, all intervals are overlapping. If we simply move each interval by the same distance, the intervals will still be overlapping. We need to find a way to move the intervals so that they are pairwise disjoint.

**2. Not handling the case where the intervals are not sorted.**

In the example input, the intervals are not sorted. If we simply move each interval by the same distance, the intervals will still not be pairwise disjoint. We need to sort the intervals before we move them.

**3. Not handling the case where the intervals are very long.**

In the example input, the intervals are very long. If we simply move each interval by the same distance, the cost will be very high. We need to find a way to move the intervals so that the cost is minimized.

**4. Not handling the case where the intervals are very close together.**

In the example input, the intervals are very close together. If we simply move each interval by the same distance, the intervals will still be overlapping. We need to find a way to move the intervals so that they are pairwise disjoint without overlapping.

**5. Not handling the case where the intervals are very small.**

In the example input, the intervals are very small. If we simply move each interval by the same distance, the intervals will still be overlapping. We need to find a way to move the intervals so that they are pairwise disjoint without overlapping.

```
A B C
```

However, a developer may accidentally input the format as follows:

```
A B C D
```

This would cause the program to crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is specified as follows:

```
YES
```

or

```
NO
```

However, a developer may accidentally output the format as follows:

```
yes
```

or

```
no
```

This would cause the program to produce incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic for determining whether a Haiku can be constructed is as follows:

1. The sum of the three syllables must be 17.
2. The first syllable must be 5.
3. The second syllable must be 7.
4. The third syllable must be 5.

A developer may accidentally implement the logic incorrectly, which would cause the program to produce incorrect output.

**4. Incorrect error handling**

The program should handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input format is incorrect, the program should print an error message and exit.

**5. Uncaught exceptions**

The program should catch and handle all uncaught exceptions. For example, if the program tries to divide by zero, it should catch the `ArithmeticException` and print an error message.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain a line with more than 16 players or a line with more than 16 zeros. The program should handle these cases gracefully.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correct. For example, the output may contain a non-integer number or a number that is not between 0 and 16. The program should handle these cases gracefully.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program may not correctly calculate the number of possible tournaments in which the friend wins the first prize. For example, the program may not consider all possible ways to arrange the players in the tournament tree. The program should correctly calculate the number of possible tournaments.
4. **Memory leak**. The program may not release memory that it has allocated. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash. The program should release all memory that it has allocated.
5. **Race condition**. The program may not be thread-safe. This can lead to incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time. The program should be thread-safe.
6. **Deadlock**. The program may deadlock if it is not designed properly. This can prevent the program from making progress and can eventually cause it to crash. The program should be designed to avoid deadlocks.
7. **Security vulnerability**. The program may contain a security vulnerability. For example, the program may allow a malicious user to gain unauthorized access to the system. The program should be designed to be secure.

Title:
AIZU p01481 Lucky Dip

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct.** The input format is `n m`, where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns. If the input format is not correct, the program will crash.

**2. The input data is not valid.** The input data should be a binary matrix, where `0` represents an empty cell and `1` represents a filled cell. If the input data is not valid, the program will crash.

**3. The program does not handle corner cases correctly.** For example, if the input data is a square matrix with side length 1, the program should output `0`. However, if the program does not handle this corner case correctly, it may output an incorrect answer.

**4. The program has a time complexity of O(n^2).** This is not a good time complexity for a problem with a large input. If the input is large, the program will run slowly.

**5. The program has a space complexity of O(n).** This is a good space complexity for a problem with a large input. However, if the input is small, the program may use more memory than necessary.

Title:
AIZU p01794 Cost Performance Flow

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is specified in the problem statement. Make sure to read it carefully and parse the input correctly.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When computing the running time or cost of a solution, it is easy to make a mistake and add or subtract one too many or too few elements. Be careful to check your work carefully.
3. **Memory leaks.** When allocating memory for dynamic data structures, it is important to free the memory when you are done with it. If you don't, you will eventually run out of memory and your program will crash.
4. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm you choose to solve the problem may not be correct. Make sure to carefully design and test your algorithm before using it to solve the problem.
5. **Incorrect implementation.** Even if you have a correct algorithm, you still need to implement it correctly. Make sure to carefully write and test your code before submitting it.

Title:
AIZU p02362 Single Source Shortest Path (Negative Edges)

Pain points:
-1 **1. Using an incorrect data structure**

The input data is a graph represented as an adjacency list. An adjacency list is a data structure that stores a list of edges for each vertex in the graph. This data structure is not suitable for solving this problem because it does not allow us to efficiently find all the shortest paths from a given vertex to all other vertices in the graph.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The Bellman-Ford algorithm is a well-known algorithm for finding the shortest paths from a given vertex to all other vertices in a graph. However, this algorithm does not work correctly if the graph contains negative edges.

**3. Not handling negative cycles correctly**

A negative cycle is a cycle in a graph whose sum of edge costs is negative. If a graph contains a negative cycle, then there is no shortest path from any vertex to any other vertex in the graph.

**4. Using floating-point numbers**

The input data may contain floating-point numbers. However, floating-point numbers are not always accurate, and this can lead to incorrect results.

**5. Not handling overflow correctly**

The input data may contain very large or very small numbers. If these numbers are not handled correctly, then the algorithm may crash or produce incorrect results.

**6. Not handling degenerate cases correctly**

The input data may contain degenerate cases, such as a graph with no edges or a graph with only one vertex. These cases must be handled correctly in order to avoid errors.
