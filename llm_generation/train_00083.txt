CODECHEF bytesg

Pain points:
1. **The input string `S` may contain characters that are not letters.** This could cause problems if the user enters a variant of the answer that contains these characters. For example, if `S` contains the character `@`, the user could enter a variant that contains the character `@` and the program would incorrectly accept it as correct.
2. **The input string `S` may contain multiple spaces.** This could cause problems if the user enters a variant of the answer that contains multiple spaces. For example, if `S` contains the string `Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar`, the user could enter a variant that contains the string `Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar ` and the program would incorrectly accept it as correct.
3. **The input string `S` may contain uppercase and lowercase letters.** This could cause problems if the user enters a variant of the answer that uses different case than the expected answer. For example, if `S` contains the string `Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar`, the user could enter a variant that contains the string `sachin ramesh tendulkar` and the program would incorrectly accept it as correct.
4. **The user may enter an answer that is not a variant of the expected answer.** For example, if `S` contains the string `Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar`, the user could enter a variant that contains the string `Ramesh Tendulkar` and the program would incorrectly reject it as incorrect.
5. **The user may enter an answer that is longer than the expected answer.** For example, if `S` contains the string `Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar`, the user could enter a variant that contains the string `Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar Sachin Tendulkar` and the program would incorrectly accept it as correct.
6. **The user may enter an answer that is shorter than the expected answer.** For example, if `S` contains the string `Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar`, the user could enter a variant that contains the string `Sachin Ramesh` and the program would incorrectly reject it as incorrect.
7. **The user may enter an answer that contains extra spaces.** For example, if `S` contains the string `Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar`, the user could enter a variant that contains the string `Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar  ` and the program would incorrectly accept it as correct.
8. **The user may enter an answer that contains incorrect punctuation.** For example, if `S` contains the string `Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar`, the user could enter a variant that contains the string `Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar.` and the program would incorrectly accept it as correct.
9. **The user may enter an answer that contains incorrect capitalization.** For example, if `S` contains the string `Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar`, the user could enter a variant that contains the string `Sachin RAHmesh TENdulkar` and the program would incorrectly accept it as correct.
10. **The user may enter an answer that contains incorrect spacing.** For example, if `S` contains the string `Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar`, the user could enter a variant that contains the string `SachinRameshTendulkar` and the program would incorrectly accept it as correct.

Title:
CODECHEF gmb01

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect variable type**

The input height and number of platforms are both integers, but the code is using them as strings. This will cause errors when trying to compare them or perform mathematical operations on them.

**2. Missing or incorrect spaces**

The input platforms are separated by spaces, but the code is not correctly handling this. This will cause errors when trying to iterate over the platforms or access their values.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The code is not correctly checking if it is possible to complete the game. It is only checking if the highest platform is lower than the catapult's maximum height, which is not sufficient.

**4. Uncaught exceptions**

The code is not handling errors correctly. If the input is invalid, the code will crash. This should be avoided by checking the input for errors before processing it.

**5. Inefficient code**

The code could be made more efficient by using more efficient algorithms and data structures. This would reduce the amount of time it takes to run the code.

Title:
CODECHEF marcha1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input data is a list of integers, but the developer may accidentally define it as a list of strings. This will cause errors when trying to perform mathematical operations on the list elements.
2. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, they may try to brute-force the solution by checking all possible combinations of banknotes, which would be very inefficient.
3. **Incorrect implementation**. The developer may make mistakes in their implementation of the algorithm. For example, they may forget to initialize variables or make typos in their code.
4. **Runtime errors**. The developer may make mistakes that cause the program to run into runtime errors. For example, they may try to access an element of a list that doesn't exist or divide by zero.
5. **Memory errors**. The developer may make mistakes that cause the program to use too much memory. For example, they may create too many temporary variables or not free memory that is no longer needed.
6. **Logic errors**. The developer may make mistakes in their logic that cause the program to produce incorrect results. For example, they may forget to check for a corner case or make a mistake in their calculations.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully review their code and test it thoroughly before deploying it to production.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is HH:MM (24-hour format). If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to process the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the maximal time**. The maximal time is the time after S seconds that is the largest possible value. The program must be able to calculate this value correctly.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is HH:MM (24-hour format). The program must be able to output the maximal time in this format.
4. **Other bugs**. There may be other bugs in the program that could cause it to not work correctly. For example, the program could have a logic error, or it could use incorrect data types.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input format, the calculation of the maximal time, and the output format. The developer should also test the program thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly.

CODEFORCES 1015_A. Points in Segments

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to include the newline character between the two integers in a segment, the input will be interpreted incorrectly.
2. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm for solving this problem is not particularly difficult, but it's easy to make a mistake in the implementation. For example, you might forget to check for overlapping segments, or you might not correctly account for the case where a segment degenerates to a point.
3. **Incorrect output format.** The output format for this problem is also very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, you might forget to print the newline character between the two lines of output, or you might not print the points in the correct order.
4. **Runtime errors.** This problem can be solved in O(n log n) time, but it's easy to make a mistake in the implementation that results in a slower runtime. For example, you might not use an efficient sorting algorithm, or you might not use a data structure that supports efficient range queries.
5. **Memory errors.** This problem does not require a lot of memory, but it's easy to make a mistake in the implementation that results in a memory leak. For example, you might not free the memory that you allocate for your data structures, or you might not close the file that you open for reading the input.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1038_E. Maximum Matching

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is specified as follows:

```
The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of given blocks.

Each of the following n lines describes corresponding block and consists of color_{1,i}, value_i and color_{2,i} (1 ≤ color_{1,i}, color_{2,i} ≤ 4, 1 ≤ value_i ≤ 100 000).
```

A common mistake that developers make when solving this problem is to incorrectly parse the input format. For example, they might accidentally read the first line of input as a list of integers, rather than a single integer. This would result in an incorrect solution.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is specified as follows:

```
Print exactly one integer — the maximum total value of the subset of blocks, which makes a valid sequence.
```

A common mistake that developers make when solving this problem is to output the wrong format. For example, they might output a list of integers, rather than a single integer. This would result in an incorrect solution.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm that a developer uses to solve this problem is also a common source of bugs. For example, a developer might use an incorrect greedy algorithm, which would not always find the optimal solution.

**4. Incorrect data structures**

The data structures that a developer uses to solve this problem can also be a source of bugs. For example, a developer might use a data structure that is not efficient for the problem at hand. This could result in a solution that is slower than necessary.

**5. Incorrect implementation**

Finally, the implementation of the algorithm itself can also be a source of bugs. For example, a developer might make a mistake in their code, which would result in an incorrect solution.

By avoiding these common problems, developers can increase their chances of solving this problem correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1228_C. Primes and Multiplication

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) should be used to ensure that the answer is within the range of the data type. For example, if the answer is 1000000000000000000 and the data type is int, the modulo operator should be used as follows:

```
answer % (10**9 + 7)
```

2. **Incorrect use of exponentiation operator.** The exponentiation operator (**) should be used with care, as it can easily overflow. For example, the following code will overflow:

```
answer = 2 ** 1000000000
```

To avoid overflow, the exponent should be checked to ensure that it is within the range of the data type. For example, the following code will not overflow:

```
if exponent < 1000000000:
    answer = 2 ** exponent
```

3. **Incorrect use of division operator.** The division operator (/) should be used with care, as it can easily result in rounding errors. For example, the following code will result in a rounding error:

```
answer = 1000000000 / 1000000001
```

To avoid rounding errors, the divisor should be checked to ensure that it is not too close to zero. For example, the following code will not result in a rounding error:

```
if divisor > 1000000000:
    answer = 1000000000 / divisor
```

4. **Incorrect use of factorial function.** The factorial function (factorial()) can easily overflow. For example, the following code will overflow:

```
answer = factorial(1000000000)
```

To avoid overflow, the factorial function should be used with care. For example, the following code will not overflow:

```
if n < 1000000000:
    answer = factorial(n)
```

5. **Incorrect use of the Sieve of Eratosthenes.** The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a very efficient algorithm for finding all of the prime numbers up to a given number. However, it is important to use the Sieve of Eratosthenes correctly, as it can easily be implemented incorrectly. For example, the following implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes is incorrect:

```
def sieve(n):
    # Create a list of all of the numbers from 2 to n.
    numbers = [i for i in range(2, n + 1)]

    # Iterate over all of the numbers in the list.
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # If the current number is prime, mark all of its multiples as non-prime.
        if numbers[i] == True:
            for j in range(i * i, n + 1, i):
                numbers[j] = False

    # Return the list of prime numbers.
    return [i for i in numbers if i == True]
```

The incorrect implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes above will not find all of the prime numbers up to n. This is because the algorithm does not check to see if a number is divisible by any of the numbers that have already been marked as non-prime. For example, the algorithm will not find the prime number 13, because it is divisible by 3, which has already been marked as non-prime.

To correctly implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes, it is important to check to see if a number is divisible by any of the numbers that have already been marked as non-prime. This can be done by using the following algorithm:

```
def sieve(n):
    # Create a list of all of the numbers from 2 to n.
    numbers = [i for i in range(2, n + 1)]

    # Iterate over all of the numbers in the list.
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # If the current number is prime, mark all of its multiples as non-prime.
        if numbers[i] == True:
            for j in range(i * i, n + 1, i):
                numbers[j] = False

    # Return the

Pain points:

 **Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading it in. For example, you might forget to read in the number of test cases, or you might misread the dimensions of the table.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format for this problem is also specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when writing it out. For example, you might forget to print the number of operations, or you might print the operations in the wrong order.
* **Incorrect algorithm:** The algorithm for solving this problem is not trivial, and it is easy to make a mistake when implementing it. For example, you might forget to check that the three cells you are considering for an operation are all in the same 2x2 square, or you might forget to update the table after making an operation.
* **Incorrect runtime:** The time complexity of the algorithm for solving this problem is O(nm), and it is easy to make a mistake when implementing it so that it runs in this time. For example, you might use an inefficient data structure to store the table, or you might make repeated passes over the table.
* **Incorrect memory usage:** The memory complexity of the algorithm for solving this problem is O(nm), and it is easy to make a mistake when implementing it so that it uses this much memory. For example, you might use an inefficient data structure to store the table, or you might allocate and deallocate memory unnecessarily.

CODEFORCES 1467_E. Distinctive Roots in a Tree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the DFS algorithm.** The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph in a depth-first order. It can be used to find the number of distinctive roots in a tree by starting at each vertex and recursively visiting all of its adjacent vertices. However, if the DFS algorithm is implemented incorrectly, it may not visit all of the vertices in the tree, or it may visit the vertices in the wrong order. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect handling of duplicate values.** The problem statement states that "Two different paths may have values in common but a single path must have all distinct values." This means that if a vertex has a duplicate value, it cannot be a distinctive root. However, if the DFS algorithm does not correctly handle duplicate values, it may incorrectly identify a vertex with a duplicate value as a distinctive root.
3. **Incorrect handling of cycles.** A cycle in a graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. If a tree has a cycle, it cannot have any distinctive roots. However, if the DFS algorithm does not correctly handle cycles, it may incorrectly identify a vertex in a cycle as a distinctive root.
4. **Incorrect use of global variables.** The DFS algorithm often uses global variables to store information about the visited vertices. If these global variables are not used correctly, it can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement does not specify any edge cases. However, there are a few edge cases that a developer should be aware of when solving this problem. For example, if the tree has only one vertex, it will have no distinctive roots.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully implement the DFS algorithm and to test the code thoroughly. It is also important to be aware of the edge cases and to handle them correctly.

CODEFORCES 1491_H. Yuezheng Ling and Dynamic Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the LCA algorithm.** The LCA algorithm is a well-known algorithm for finding the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree. However, there are a few common mistakes that developers make when implementing this algorithm.
    * **Using the wrong definition of LCA.** The LCA of two nodes is the node that is the ancestor of both nodes and is at the lowest level in the tree. This means that the LCA of two nodes is not necessarily the node that is closest to the root.
    * **Using a recursive implementation of the LCA algorithm.** The recursive implementation of the LCA algorithm is often inefficient, as it can lead to stack overflow errors. A more efficient implementation of the LCA algorithm uses a bottom-up approach.
    * **Not handling the case where one of the nodes is not in the tree.** The LCA algorithm should handle the case where one of the nodes is not in the tree. In this case, the LCA of the two nodes is simply the node that is closer to the root.

2. **Incorrect handling of queries.** The problem statement specifies that there must be at least one query of the second type. However, if a developer does not check for this condition, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

3. **Incorrect handling of input.** The problem statement specifies that the input will be a sequence of integers. However, if a developer does not check for this condition, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

4. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem statement specifies that the tree will be represented as an array of integers. However, if a developer uses a different data structure, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

5. **Incorrect error handling.** The problem statement does not specify any error conditions. However, if a developer does not handle errors gracefully, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

6. **Incorrect testing.** The problem statement does not provide any test cases. However, it is important to write unit tests to ensure that the program is correct.

7. **Incorrect submission.** The problem statement specifies that the output must be a sequence of integers. However, if a developer does not format the output correctly, the submission may be rejected.

CODEFORCES 472_A. Design Tutorial: Learn from Math

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is specified as "The only line contains an integer n (12 ≤ n ≤ 106)". If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to process the input and will generate an error.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is specified as "Output two composite integers x and y (1 < x, y < n) such that x + y = n". If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will generate an error.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program must be able to correctly identify two composite integers x and y such that x + y = n. If the logic is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will generate an error.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program must be able to allocate and free memory correctly. If there are memory leaks, the program will eventually run out of memory and crash.
5. **Race conditions**. The program must be able to handle multiple threads safely. If there are race conditions, the program may produce incorrect results or crash.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program must be secure against malicious input. If there are security vulnerabilities, the program may be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system.

Title:
CODEFORCES 51_E. Pentagon

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data specifies that the number of junctions can be up to 700, but the problem statement also states that the number of roads can be up to n*(n-1)/2, which is much larger than 700 for large values of n. This means that you need to use a data type that can store numbers larger than 700, such as long long int.

**2. Not handling the case where there are no roads**

The problem statement states that "It is not guaranteed that from any junction one can get to any other one moving along the roads." This means that it is possible that there are no roads in the input data. If this happens, your code should print 0.

**3. Not handling the case where there are multiple cycles of length 5**

The problem statement states that "the number of possible ways of building Pentagon in the city is equal to the number of different cycles at lengths of 5, composed of junctions and roads." This means that you need to count all of the different cycles of length 5 in the input data, not just the first one that you find.

**4. Using incorrect algorithms**

The problem statement states that "Only well-optimized solutions will be accepted." This means that you need to use an efficient algorithm to solve the problem. A simple brute-force algorithm would not be efficient enough, and would likely time out on the larger test cases.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it to the competition. This will help you to identify and fix any bugs in your code. You can test your code on the sample input data provided by the problem statement, as well as on your own test cases.

**6. Submitting your code**

Once you have tested your code and are satisfied that it is correct, you can submit it to the competition. Make sure that you follow the submission guidelines carefully, and that you include all of the necessary files.

CODEFORCES 547_A. Mike and Frog

Pain points:

 So, the answer is 3. 1. **Incorrect modulo operation.** The modulo operation (%) returns the remainder of a division. For example, 10 % 3 = 1. However, some developers may mistakenly use the division operator (/) to calculate the remainder. For example, 10 / 3 = 3.333..., which is not an integer. This error can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over a list or array, it is important to make sure that the index is incremented correctly. A common mistake is to increment the index by one too many times, which can lead to an off-by-one error. For example, if you are iterating over a list of numbers from 0 to 9, and you want to print the first five numbers, you would need to iterate from 0 to 4.
3. **Incorrect use of conditional statements.** When using conditional statements, it is important to make sure that the conditions are correct. For example, if you are checking if a number is equal to zero, you should use the == operator, not the = operator. The = operator assigns a value to a variable, while the == operator checks if two values are equal.
4. **Incorrect use of loops.** When using loops, it is important to make sure that the loop terminates correctly. For example, if you are iterating over a list of numbers, you need to make sure that you check the end of the list before continuing to iterate. Otherwise, you could end up with an infinite loop.
5. **Incorrect use of functions.** When using functions, it is important to make sure that you call the function correctly and that you pass the correct arguments. For example, if you are calling a function that takes two arguments, you need to make sure that you pass two arguments to the function. Otherwise, the function will not work correctly.
6. **Incorrect use of data structures.** When using data structures, it is important to make sure that you use them correctly. For example, if you are using a list, you need to make sure that you add and remove elements from the list correctly. Otherwise, the list will not work correctly.
7. **Incorrect use of file IO.** When reading from or writing to a file, it is important to make sure that you close the file after you are finished. Otherwise, the file may not be closed properly, which can lead to data corruption.

CODEFORCES 573_C. Bear and Drawing

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not correct. For example, the input may contain a negative integer, a float number, or a string.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not correct. For example, the output may contain a space, a tab, or a newline character.

**3. Undefined behavior**

The program may behave in an unexpected way if it is given an invalid input. For example, the program may crash or print an incorrect output.

**4. Memory leak**

The program may not release the memory that it has allocated. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.

**5. Race condition**

The program may not be thread-safe. This can lead to unexpected results if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.

**6. Deadlock**

The program may enter a deadlock state, where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can prevent the program from making any progress.

**7. Stack overflow**

The program may recursively call itself too many times, causing a stack overflow. This can prevent the program from running correctly.

**8. Buffer overflow**

The program may write more data to a buffer than it can hold. This can corrupt the data in the buffer and lead to unexpected results.

**9. Integer overflow**

The program may calculate an integer value that is too large for the data type that is used to store it. This can lead to unexpected results or a program crash.

**10. Floating-point error**

The program may calculate a floating-point value that is not accurate. This can lead to unexpected results or a program crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 595_A. Vitaly and Night

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data is given as two integers and a 2D array of characters. The integers are easy to parse, but the 2D array of characters can be tricky. If you're not careful, you might accidentally use the wrong data type for the array, such as a list or a tuple. This will cause errors when you try to access the elements of the array.

**2. Forgetting to initialize variables**

When you're working with arrays, it's important to initialize them to a value before you start using them. Otherwise, you might accidentally get unexpected results. For example, if you try to access an element of an array that hasn't been initialized, you'll get a `ValueError`.

**3. Using the wrong index**

When you're accessing elements of an array, it's important to make sure you're using the correct index. If you use the wrong index, you'll get a `IndexError`. For example, if you try to access the element at index 10 in an array that only has 5 elements, you'll get an `IndexError`.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

When you're writing code, it's important to handle edge cases. For example, what happens if the input data is invalid? What happens if the array is empty? What happens if you try to access an element of the array that doesn't exist? You need to make sure your code can handle these cases gracefully.

**5. Using inefficient algorithms**

There are many different ways to solve a problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. When you're writing code, it's important to choose an algorithm that is efficient for the problem you're solving. For example, if you're trying to find the maximum element in an array, you could use a linear search or a binary search. The binary search is more efficient than the linear search, so you should use it if you can.

**6. Not testing your code**

Before you deploy your code to production, it's important to test it thoroughly. This will help you catch any bugs before they cause problems for your users. There are many different ways to test code. You can use unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. You should use a combination of these tests to cover all aspects of your code.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input format is "5 5\n1 2 3 4 5", the program may expect the next line to contain 5 integers, but it actually contains only 4 integers.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to produce incorrect output. For example, if the output format is "1 5", the program may print "1 6".
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program may have incorrect logic, which may cause it to produce incorrect output. For example, the program may not consider all possible cases.
4. **Memory leak**. The program may not release memory properly, which may cause the program to run out of memory.
5. **Time complexity**. The program may have a time complexity that is too high, which may cause the program to run slowly.
6. **Space complexity**. The program may have a space complexity that is too high, which may cause the program to use too much memory.

CODEFORCES 635_E. Package Delivery

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input format is not specified clearly. Does the input contain an empty line between the first line and the first gas station? Does the input contain a newline after the last gas station?
* The input may contain invalid values. For example, the distance to the district center may be negative, or the number of gas stations may be zero.
* The input may contain duplicate gas stations.
* The input may contain gas stations that are not reachable from the starting point.
* The output format is not specified clearly. Does the output need to be an integer? Does the output need to be positive?
* The output may be incorrect. For example, the output may be negative, or the output may be greater than the minimum possible cost.

Here are some possible solutions to these problems:

* To avoid problems with the input format, you can use the `Scanner` class in Java or the `input()` function in Python. These classes/functions will automatically skip any whitespace characters (such as newlines) in the input.
* To check for invalid values, you can use the `Integer.parseInt()` method in Java or the `int(x)` function in Python. These methods will throw an exception if the input is not a valid integer.
* To check for duplicate gas stations, you can use a hash set or a dictionary. A hash set is a data structure that stores unique elements, and a dictionary is a data structure that stores key-value pairs.
* To check for gas stations that are not reachable from the starting point, you can use a priority queue. A priority queue is a data structure that stores elements in sorted order. You can use the priority queue to find the closest gas station to the starting point.
* To ensure that the output is correct, you can use the following algorithm:

    1. Initialize the cost to 0.
    2. For each gas station, do the following:
        * If the gas station is not reachable from the starting point, continue to the next gas station.
        * If the gas station is reachable from the starting point, update the cost to the minimum of the current cost and the cost of driving to the gas station plus the cost of buying gas at the gas station.
    3. Return the cost.

CODEFORCES 664_D. Graph Coloring

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly and in the correct format. For example, if you are reading the input as a list of strings, you will need to make sure that each string is formatted correctly.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also very specific. It is important to make sure that you are outputting the correct information in the correct format. For example, you need to make sure that you are outputting the number of moves first, followed by the list of vertices that you are using to make the moves.

**3. Incorrect graph representation**

The graph for this problem is represented as a list of edges. Each edge is represented by a tuple of three elements: the two vertices that are connected by the edge, and the color of the edge. It is important to make sure that you are correctly representing the graph in this format.

**4. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm that you use to solve this problem is very important. You need to make sure that your algorithm is correct and efficient. For example, you could use a greedy algorithm to solve this problem.

**5. Incorrect implementation**

The implementation of your algorithm is also very important. You need to make sure that your code is correct and efficient. For example, you could use a data structure like a hash table to store the information about the graph.

**6. Incorrect test cases**

It is important to test your code with a variety of test cases. This will help you to identify any bugs in your code. For example, you could test your code with graphs of different sizes and with different edge colors.

CODEFORCES 689_B. Mike and Shortcuts

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or it may contain more or fewer than two lines.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may contain a number that is not an integer, or it may contain more or fewer than `n` numbers.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not always find the shortest path from the start intersection to the end intersection.
4. **Memory limit exceeded**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may use too much memory. For example, the algorithm may create a large data structure that is not necessary for solving the problem.
5. **Time limit exceeded**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may take too long to run. For example, the algorithm may use a recursive solution that takes exponential time to run.
6. **Wrong answer**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may not find the correct answer. For example, the algorithm may find a path that is not the shortest possible path.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to design an algorithm that is correct, efficient, and uses as little memory as possible. Finally, it is important to test the algorithm thoroughly to ensure that it produces the correct answer for all possible inputs.

 **1. Using an incorrect data structure to store the strings.**

The problem statement specifies that the strings in the set D should be unique. This means that we cannot simply store the strings in a list or an array. We need to use a data structure that allows us to quickly check whether a given string is already in the set. A hash table would be a good choice for this problem.

**2. Not flushing the output buffer after each write.**

The problem statement specifies that we need to use functions like fflush() or BufferedWriter.flush() after each write in our program. This is because the input and output streams are buffered, and if we do not flush the buffer, the output from our program may not be visible to the judge.

**3. Making a mistake in the logic of the program.**

The logic of the program should be correct in order to solve the problem. Some common mistakes that developers make include:

* Using the wrong data type for a variable.
* Forgetting to initialize a variable.
* Making a mistake in a mathematical calculation.
* Using an incorrect algorithm.

**4. Not handling errors correctly.**

The program should be able to handle errors gracefully. For example, if the user enters an invalid input, the program should print an error message and exit.

**5. Not testing the program thoroughly.**

It is important to test the program thoroughly before submitting it to the judge. This will help to catch any bugs that may be present in the program.

Title:
CODEFORCES 731_F. Video Cards

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a list of integers. If you use a data type that is too small to store all the integers, you will get an overflow error. For example, if you use `int` to store the integers, you will get an overflow error if any of the integers is greater than `2147483647`.

To avoid this problem, you should use a data type that is large enough to store all the integers. For example, you can use `long` or `unsigned long long`.

**2. Not considering the leading video card**

The problem statement states that "the power of each of the secondary video cards is divisible by the power of the leading video card". This means that the leading video card must be a factor of all the other video cards. If you don't consider the leading video card, you will not be able to find the maximum total power of the video cards.

To avoid this problem, you should first find the leading video card. Then, you can find the maximum total power of the video cards by multiplying the power of the leading video card by the sum of the powers of the other video cards.

**3. Not reducing the power of the secondary video cards**

The problem statement states that "the power of each of the secondary video cards can be reduced to any integer value less or equal than the current power". This means that you can reduce the power of the secondary video cards so that they are divisible by the power of the leading video card.

To avoid this problem, you should first find the leading video card. Then, you should reduce the power of the secondary video cards so that they are divisible by the power of the leading video card. Finally, you can find the maximum total power of the video cards by multiplying the power of the leading video card by the sum of the powers of the other video cards.

**4. Not considering the case where all the video cards are divisible by the same number**

The problem statement states that "the power of each of the secondary video cards is divisible by the power of the leading video card". This means that all the video cards must be divisible by the same number. If all the video cards are divisible by the same number, you can simply multiply the power of the leading video card by the number of video cards.

To avoid this problem, you should first check if all the video cards are divisible by the same number. If they are, you can simply multiply the power of the leading video card by the number of video cards. Otherwise, you need to reduce the power of the secondary video cards so that they are divisible by the power of the leading video card.

2. **Incorrect variable initialization**. Variables must be initialized with the correct data type and value. For example, if a variable is initialized with a value that is too large, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be correct in order for it to work properly. For example, if the program does not check for errors in the input, it may crash.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format must be correct in order for the program to be readable. For example, if the program outputs the wrong number of digits, it will be difficult to understand.
5. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Synchronization issues**. Synchronization issues can occur when multiple threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to errors in the program.
7. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when the outcome of a program depends on the order in which two or more threads execute. This can lead to errors in the program.
8. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, and this results in a situation where no thread can continue. This can lead to the program freezing.
9. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can occur when a program does not properly protect its data. This can lead to attackers gaining access to sensitive data or taking control of the program.
10. **Performance issues**. Performance issues can occur when a program is not optimized properly. This can lead to the program running slowly or using too much memory.

CODEFORCES 801_E. Vulnerable Kerbals

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain a non-integer value, or two integers are not separated by a space.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed. For example, the output may not contain two lines, or the second line may not contain space-separated integers.
3. **Incorrect calculation of prefix products**. The prefix products of the sequence may not be distinct. For example, the prefix products of the sequence `[1, 2, 3]` are `[1, 2, 6]`, which are not distinct.
4. **Incorrect construction of the sequence**. The sequence may not satisfy the properties mentioned in the problem statement. For example, the sequence `[1, 2, 3]` does not satisfy the property that no prefix product modulo m appears as an element of the input list.
5. **Other bugs**. There may be other bugs that are not mentioned above. For example, the code may not be able to handle large input values.

CODEFORCES 822_B. Crossword solving

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**. The input format should be two integers n and m, followed by the string s and t. For example:
```
3 5
abc
xaybz
```

**2. The output format is not correct**. The output should be two integers: the number of replacements and the positions of the replacements. For example:
```
2
2 3
```

**3. The program does not work correctly**. The program may not find the minimum number of replacements or may find incorrect positions of the replacements. For example, the following program does not work correctly:
```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
s = input()
t = input()

count = 0
for i in range(n):
    if s[i] != t[i]:
        count += 1
print(count)
print(*[i + 1 for i in range(n) if s[i] != t[i]])
```

This program will print the wrong answer for the input `3 5
abc
xaybz`. The correct answer is `2`, but the program will print `3`.

**4. The program has a runtime error**. The program may run out of memory or time. For example, the following program has a runtime error:
```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
s = input()
t = input()

count = 0
for i in range(n):
    if s[i] != t[i]:
        count += 1
print(count)
print(*[i + 1 for i in range(n) if s[i] != t[i]])
```

This program will run out of memory for the input `1000000 1000000
a
a`.

**5. The program has a logic error**. The program may not find the minimum number of replacements or may find incorrect positions of the replacements due to a logic error. For example, the following program has a logic error:
```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
s = input()
t = input()

count = 0
for i in range(n):
    if s[i] != t[i]:
        count += 1
print(count)
print(*[i + 1 for i in range(n) if s[i] != t[i]])
```

This program will print the wrong answer for the input `3 5
abc
xaybz`. The correct answer is `2`, but the program will print `3` because it does not consider the fact that the symbol `?` can play the role of any other symbol.
Test inputs:

CODEFORCES 939_C. Convenient For Everybody

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It requires a single integer on the first line, followed by a list of integers on the second line, and then two integers on the third line. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

**3. Undefined behavior**

The problem statement does not specify what should happen if the number of people in a time zone is greater than the number of hours in the day. If this situation occurs, the program may behave in an unexpected way.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

When working with time zones, it is important to be aware of the fact that the first time zone is 1 hour ahead of the zeroth time zone. This can lead to off-by-one errors if the program is not careful.

**5. Memory leaks**

The program should be careful not to allocate memory that it does not need. Memory leaks can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.

**6. Race conditions**

If the program is multi-threaded, it is important to be aware of the possibility of race conditions. Race conditions can occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even program crashes.

**7. Deadlocks**

If the program is multi-threaded, it is also important to be aware of the possibility of deadlocks. Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely.

Title:
HACKEREARTH doghouses

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly comparing two integers**. The code below incorrectly compares two integers:

```
if (a < b) {
  // do something
}
```

The correct way to compare two integers is to use the `<` or `>` operator. For example:

```
if (a < b) {
  // do something
}
```

2. **Using the wrong data type**. The code below uses the wrong data type to store the number of doghouses:

```
int N;
cin >> N;
```

The correct data type to store the number of doghouses is `long long`. For example:

```
long long N;
cin >> N;
```

3. **Not handling errors correctly**. The code below does not handle errors correctly:

```
try {
  // do something
} catch (...) {
  // do something else
}
```

The correct way to handle errors is to use the `try` and `catch` blocks. For example:

```
try {
  // do something
} catch (...) {
  // do something else
}
```

4. **Not using the right algorithm**. The code below uses the wrong algorithm to find the maximum number of doghouses that may be removed:

```
int max_houses = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
  for (int j = i + 1; j < N; j++) {
    if (houses[i] < houses[j]) {
      max_houses++;
    }
  }
}
cout << max_houses << endl;
```

The correct algorithm to find the maximum number of doghouses that may be removed is to use a dynamic programming approach. For example:

```
int max_houses = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
  max_houses = max(max_houses, houses[i]);
  for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
    if (houses[j] < houses[i]) {
      max_houses = max(max_houses, houses[i] - houses[j]);
    }
  }
}
cout << max_houses << endl;

Title:
HACKEREARTH gotta-catch-em-all

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input format specifies that the number of Pokemons is an integer, but the code below uses a float variable to store it. This will cause an error when the number of Pokemons is greater than 2147483647.

```
k = int(input())
```

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm below uses a greedy approach to find the earliest day when little Arihant can go meet Professor Oak. However, this algorithm is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the Pokemons can evolve in any order.

```
def find_earliest_day():
    days = [0] * k
    for i in range(k):
        days[i] = days[i - 1] + int(input())
    return min(days) + 1
```

**3. Not handling edge cases**

The code below does not handle the edge case where the number of Pokemons is 0. This will cause an error when the program is run.

```
if k == 0:
    print(0)
else:
    print(find_earliest_day())
```

**4. Using global variables**

The code below uses a global variable to store the number of Pokemons. This is a bad practice because it makes the code more difficult to read and debug.

```
k = int(input())

def find_earliest_day():
    global k
    days = [0] * k
    for i in range(k):
        days[i] = days[i - 1] + int(input())
    return min(days) + 1

print(find_earliest_day())
```

**5. Not using a unit test framework**

The code below does not use a unit test framework to test its correctness. This is a bad practice because it makes it difficult to find and fix bugs.

```
def find_earliest_day():
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":

Title:
HACKEREARTH little-jhool-and-his-breakup

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of `in` operator.** The `in` operator checks if a substring is present in a string. In the following code, the `in` operator is used to check if the string `"love"` is present in the string `message`. However, the string `"love"` is not a substring of the string `message`. This will result in a `False` value being returned.

```python
if "love" in message:
    print("I love you, too!")
else:
    print("Let us breakup!")
```

2. **Incorrect use of `len()` function.** The `len()` function returns the length of a string. In the following code, the `len()` function is used to check if the string `message` is empty. However, the string `message` is not empty. This will result in a `0` value being returned.

```python
if len(message) == 0:
    print("I love you, too!")
else:
    print("Let us breakup!")
```

3. **Incorrect use of `str()` function.** The `str()` function converts a value to a string. In the following code, the `str()` function is used to convert the integer `1` to a string. However, the integer `1` is already a string. This will result in a `"1"` string being returned.

```python
message = "love"
if str(1) in message:
    print("I love you, too!")
else:
    print("Let us breakup!")
```

4. **Incorrect use of `for` loop.** The `for` loop iterates over a sequence. In the following code, the `for` loop is used to iterate over the characters in the string `message`. However, the string `message` does not contain any characters. This will result in the `for` loop iterating over an empty sequence.

```python
message = ""
for character in message:
    if character == "l":
        print("I love you, too!")
    else:
        print("Let us breakup!")
```

5. **Incorrect use of `if` statement.** The `if` statement checks if a condition is true. In the following code, the `if` statement is used to check if the string `message` is equal to the string `"love"`. However, the string `message` is not equal to the string `"love"`. This will result in the `if` statement being false.

```python
message = "hello"
if message == "love":
    print("I love you, too!")

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable initialization.** The developer may initialize the variable incorrectly, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, initializing `n` to 0 instead of 1 would cause the loop to iterate one less time than intended.
2. **Off-by-one error.** The developer may make an off-by-one error when iterating through the array, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, iterating from `i = 0` to `n - 1` instead of `i = 1` to `n` would cause the developer to miss the first element in the array.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The developer may implement the logic incorrectly, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may incorrectly count the number of complaints made by each person.
4. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The developer may use the wrong data structure to store the data, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, using a linked list to store the arrival order of the people would be inefficient, as it would require traversing the entire list to find the person with the highest arrival order.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The developer may not handle errors correctly, which could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results. For example, the developer may not check if the input is valid, which could lead to the program crashing if the input is invalid.

HACKEREARTH samu-and-permutations

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The problem statement specifies that the input is an integer, but the code below incorrectly defines `N` as a float. This will cause the code to fail when it tries to read the input.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The problem statement specifies that the input array starts at index 1, but the code below starts at index 0. This will cause the code to miss the first element of the array, which will result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The problem statement specifies that the total taste is calculated as the sum of the absolute value of the differences between each pair of adjacent elements in the array. However, the code below incorrectly calculates the total taste as the sum of the differences between each element and the previous element. This will result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Unnecessary variable**. The variable `taste` is not used in the code, so it can be removed without affecting the functionality of the program.
5. **Inefficient algorithm**. The code below uses a nested for loop to iterate over all pairs of adjacent elements in the array. This is an inefficient algorithm, as it takes O(N^2) time to run. A more efficient algorithm would be to use a single for loop to iterate over the array, and then use a binary search to find the index of the largest element in the array. This would take O(N log N) time to run.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```
def main():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        taste = 0
        for i in range(1, N):
            taste += abs(A[i] - A[i - 1])
        print(taste)

ATCODER p02887 AtCoder Beginner Contest 143 - Slimes

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input is a string, so we need to use a string data type to store it. If we use the wrong data type, such as an integer, we will get a type error.

**2. Not handling boundary cases correctly**

The input specifies that the length of the string S is N, but what if N is 0? In this case, the string S will be empty, and we need to handle this case correctly.

**3. Not considering all possible cases**

The problem states that "Adjacent slimes with the same color will fuse into one larger slime without changing the color". But what if there are no adjacent slimes with the same color? In this case, we need to handle this case correctly.

**4. Making a mistake in the logic**

The logic for solving this problem is not very complicated, but it is still possible to make a mistake. We need to be careful to make sure that the logic is correct.

**5. Not testing the code thoroughly**

It is important to test the code thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly. We should test the code with different input values, including boundary cases, to make sure that it handles all cases correctly.

Title:
ATCODER p03022 AtCoder Grand Contest 034 - RNG and XOR

Pain points:
**Possible Problems**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the bitwise XOR operator.** The bitwise XOR operator (`^`) performs a bit-wise exclusive or operation on two operands. This means that it returns a 1 if exactly one of the operands is a 1, and a 0 otherwise. For example, `0 ^ 0 = 0`, `0 ^ 1 = 1`, and `1 ^ 1 = 0`.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (`%`) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, `10 % 3 = 1`, `11 % 3 = 2`, and `12 % 3 = 0`.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the factorial function.** The factorial function (`n!`) returns the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, `5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120`.
4. **Incorrect implementation of the Catalan number function.** The Catalan number (`C(n)``) is a sequence of integers that counts the number of ways to partition a set of n labeled objects into two nonempty subsets. For example, `C(0) = 1`, `C(1) = 1`, `C(2) = 2`, and `C(3) = 5`.
5. **Incorrect implementation of the inclusion-exclusion principle.** The inclusion-exclusion principle is a mathematical theorem that allows us to count the number of elements in a finite set that satisfy a given property. For example, if we have a set of n elements, and we want to count the number of elements that are divisible by 3, we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to find that the answer is `n - 3C1 + 3C2 - 3C3 + ... + (-1)^n*3Cn`.

**Possible Bugs**

1. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a programmer forgets to account for the first or last element in a sequence. For example, if you are iterating over a list of numbers, and you forget to check the first element, you may miss out on that element entirely.
2. **Indexing errors.** Indexing errors occur when a programmer accesses an element of an array or list using an invalid index. For example, if you try to access the element at index `n` in an array of size `n - 1`, you will get an error.
3. **Arithmetic errors.** Arithmetic errors occur when a programmer makes a mistake in performing a mathematical calculation. For example, if you add two numbers together and forget to carry the one, you will get an incorrect answer.
4. **Assignment errors.** Assignment errors occur when a programmer assigns a value to a variable incorrectly. For example, if you assign the value of `x` to the variable `y`, you will overwrite the value of `y` with the value of `x`.
5. **Logical errors.** Logical errors occur when a programmer makes a mistake in the logic of their program. For example, if you write a program to sort a list of numbers, but you forget to check if the list is already sorted, your program will not work correctly.

**How to Avoid These Problems**

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement. You should also make sure that you are familiar with the mathematical concepts and algorithms that you are using. It is also helpful to write out pseudocode or a detailed plan before you start coding. This will help you to identify and correct any potential problems before you start writing your code.

Additionally, you should always test your code thoroughly. This means running your code on a variety of input values and checking that the output is correct. You should also use a debugger to help you identify any errors in your code.

Title:
ATCODER p03162 Educational DP Contest - Vacation

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of memoization**

Memoization is a technique for storing the results of expensive computations so that they don't have to be repeated. In this problem, we can use memoization to store the maximum happiness that can be achieved by doing activities A, B, and C on the first `i` days of the vacation. However, if we incorrectly use memoization, we may end up storing the same value multiple times, which will lead to incorrect results.

To avoid this problem, we need to make sure that we only store the maximum happiness that can be achieved by doing activities A, B, and C on the first `i` days of the vacation **for a given sequence of activities**. For example, if we have already computed the maximum happiness that can be achieved by doing activities A, B, and C on the first `i` days of the vacation when the sequence of activities is `A, B, C`, we should not store the maximum happiness that can be achieved by doing activities A, B, and C on the first `i` days of the vacation when the sequence of activities is `B, C, A`.

**2. Incorrect use of dynamic programming**

Dynamic programming is a technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems. In this problem, we can use dynamic programming to solve the following subproblems:

* `dp[i][j][k]`: the maximum happiness that can be achieved by doing activities A, B, and C on the first `i` days of the vacation, where `j` is the number of days that we have done activity A, `k` is the number of days that we have done activity B, and `i - j - k` is the number of days that we have done activity C.

To solve this problem, we can start by initializing `dp[0][0][0]` to 0. Then, we can iterate over the days of the vacation, and for each day, we can update `dp[i][j][k]` to the maximum of `dp[i - 1][j][k]`, `dp[i - 1][j + 1][k]`, and `dp[i - 1][j][k + 1]`.

However, if we incorrectly use dynamic programming, we may end up updating `dp[i][j][k]` with a value that is less than the maximum happiness that can be achieved by doing activities A, B, and C on the first `i` days of the vacation. This can happen if we forget to take into account the fact that we cannot do the same activities for two or more consecutive days.

To avoid this problem, we need to make sure that we only update `dp[i][j][k]` with a value that is greater than or equal to the maximum happiness that can be achieved by doing activities A, B, and C on the first `i` days of the vacation.

**3. Incorrect use of the constraints**

The constraints for this problem are `1 <= N <= 10^5`, `1 <= a_i, b_i, c_i <= 10^4`. This means that the maximum value of `a_i + b_i + c_i` is `3 * 10^4`. However, if we incorrectly use the constraints, we may end up overflowing the integer data type when we add `a_i + b_i + c_i`.

To avoid this problem, we need to make sure that we use the correct data type to store `a_i + b_i + c_i`. In this case, we should use the `long long` data type.

**4. Incorrect use of the input format**

The input for this problem is given in the following format:

```
N
a_1 b_1 c_1
a_2 b_2 c_2
:
a_N b_N c_N
```

However, if we incorrectly use the input format, we may end up reading the input incorrectly. For example, if we forget to add a newline character after the last line of input, we may end up reading the input as a single line, which will lead to incorrect results.

To avoid this problem, we need to make sure that we read the input correctly. In this case, we should make sure to add a newline character after the last line of input.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correct. For example, the input may contain a negative number or a non-integer number.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong data type. For example, the input may contain a string instead of an integer.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The developer may make a mistake in the calculation. For example, the developer may forget to carry the decimal point when multiplying two numbers.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may make a mistake in the index of an array or list. For example, the developer may access the element at index `i + 1` instead of `i`.
5. **Infinite loop**. The developer may create an infinite loop in their code. For example, the developer may have a while loop that never terminates.
6. **Memory leak**. The developer may not release memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
7. **Race condition**. The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared resources. This can lead to a race condition, which can cause the program to produce incorrect results.
8. **Deadlock**. The developer may create a deadlock, which is a situation where two or more processes are waiting for each other to finish, but none of them can ever finish. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely.
9. **Security vulnerability**. The developer may introduce a security vulnerability in their code. For example, the developer may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

Title:
ATCODER p03465 AtCoder Grand Contest 020 - Median Sum

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of binary search**

The binary search algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that can be used to find the position of a target value in a sorted array. However, if the implementation of the binary search algorithm is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results.

For example, the following is an incorrect implementation of the binary search algorithm:

```
def binary_search(array, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(array) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if array[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif array[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return -1
```

This implementation of the binary search algorithm will not work correctly if the array is not sorted. In this case, the algorithm will not be able to find the target value, and it will return -1.

**2. Using the wrong data type**

When solving a problem, it is important to use the correct data type for the values that you are working with. If you use the wrong data type, it can lead to incorrect results.

For example, the following code will not work correctly because the variable `sum` is declared as a `float` type, but the values in the array `A` are integers:

```
N = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

sum = 0
for i in range(N):
    sum += A[i]

print(sum / N)
```

This code will produce an incorrect result because the value of `sum` will be rounded to the nearest decimal place, even though the values in the array `A` are integers.

**3. Using an inefficient algorithm**

When solving a problem, it is important to use an efficient algorithm. An efficient algorithm is one that uses a small amount of time and space to solve the problem.

For example, the following is an inefficient algorithm for finding the median of a list of numbers:

```
def find_median(nums):
    mid = len(nums) // 2
    return nums[mid]
```

This algorithm will take O(n) time to run, where n is the length of the list of numbers. A more efficient algorithm would be to use the quicksort algorithm to sort the list of numbers, and then take the middle element of the sorted list. This algorithm would take O(n log n) time to run, which is much more efficient than the first algorithm.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

When solving a problem, it is important to handle all of the edge cases. An edge case is a situation that is not explicitly mentioned in the problem statement, but that can still occur.

For example, the following code will not work correctly if the input list is empty:

```
def find_median(nums):
    if len(nums) == 0:
        return None

    return nums[len(nums) // 2]
```

This code will throw an error if the input list is empty. A more robust solution would be to check if the input list is empty before trying to find the median.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it to a competition. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed.

There are a number of ways to test your code. You can use a unit testing framework, or you can manually test your code by entering different inputs and checking the outputs.

By testing your code thoroughly, you can help to ensure that it is correct and that it will produce the correct results.

ATCODER p03625 AtCoder Beginner Contest 071 - Make a Rectangle

Pain points:
**1. Not handling the case where N is less than 4.** The problem states that N must be at least 4, but some solutions may not check this condition. This can lead to a runtime error or an incorrect answer.

**2. Not handling the case where all of the sticks have the same length.** If all of the sticks have the same length, then it is impossible to form a rectangle. Some solutions may not check this condition, which can lead to an incorrect answer.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm to find the maximum possible area.** The problem states that the maximum possible area of the rectangle is the product of the two longest sticks. Some solutions may use an incorrect algorithm to find the two longest sticks, which can lead to an incorrect answer.

**4. Not handling the case where the input is malformed.** The input may be malformed in a number of ways, such as containing invalid characters or not having the correct format. Some solutions may not handle malformed input correctly, which can lead to a runtime error or an incorrect answer.

**5. Not handling the case where the output is too large.** The output may be too large to fit in the provided data type. Some solutions may not handle this case correctly, which can lead to a runtime error or an incorrect answer.

Title:
ATCODER p03785 AtCoder Grand Contest 011 - Airport Bus

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm.** The greedy algorithm for this problem is to sort the passengers by their arrival time and then to start filling buses from the earliest arrival time until all passengers are served. However, if the greedy algorithm is implemented incorrectly, it is possible to miss some passengers. For example, consider the following input:

```
N = 3
C = 2
K = 1
T = [1, 2, 3]
```

The greedy algorithm would first fill a bus with the passenger who arrives at time 1 and then a bus with the passenger who arrives at time 2. However, this would leave the passenger who arrives at time 3 without a bus.

* **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of buses.** The minimum number of buses required to serve all passengers is equal to the maximum number of passengers that can be served by a single bus. For example, if the input is as follows:

```
N = 5
C = 3
K = 2
T = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

The maximum number of passengers that can be served by a single bus is 3, so the minimum number of buses required is 5 / 3 = 1.5. However, the minimum number of buses cannot be fractional, so the answer should be rounded up to 2.

* **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The input data for this problem can be very large, so it is important to be careful to avoid overflow errors. For example, the following input would cause an overflow error:

```
N = 100000
C = 100000
K = 100000
T = [1, 2, 3, ..., 100000]
```

To avoid this problem, it is necessary to use a data type that is large enough to store the values in the input data.

* **Incorrect use of the STL.** The STL is a powerful tool, but it is important to use it correctly. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
std::vector<int> T;
T.push_back(1);
T.push_back(2);
T.push_back(3);

int N = T.size();
```

This code would create a vector with three elements, but the value of N would be 0. To avoid this problem, it is necessary to initialize the vector before adding elements to it.

* **Incorrect use of pointers.** Pointers can be a powerful tool, but they can also be dangerous. For example, the following code would cause a segmentation fault:

```
int* T = new int[N];
T[0] = 1;
T[1] = 2;
T[2] = 3;

delete[] T;
```

This code would free the memory that was allocated for the vector, but it would not delete the elements in the vector. This would cause a segmentation fault when the program tries to access the elements in the vector.

* **Incorrect use of exceptions.** Exceptions can be a useful way to handle errors, but they can also be dangerous. For example, the following code would not handle an exception correctly:

```
try {
  std::vector<int> T;
  T.push_back(1);
  T.push_back(2);
  T.push_back(3);

  int N = T.size();
} catch (std::exception e) {
  // Handle exception
}
```

This code would not print the error message that was generated by the exception. To avoid this problem, it is necessary to catch the exception and print the error message.

Title:
ATCODER p03953 AtCoder Grand Contest 006 - Rabbit Exercise

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The most common mistake when solving this problem is to implement the algorithm incorrectly. This can lead to incorrect results or even a runtime error.

**2. Using incorrect data types**

Another common mistake is to use incorrect data types. For example, if you are using floating-point numbers to represent the positions of the rabbits, you may get incorrect results due to rounding errors.

**3. Not handling edge cases correctly**

The problem statement specifies some edge cases that you need to handle correctly. For example, if the number of rabbits is 1, then the expected value of the position of the rabbit after K sets is simply x_1.

**4. Not using efficient algorithms**

The problem can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming. However, if you use an inefficient algorithm, you may run out of time on the test cases.

**5. Not debugging your code**

It is important to debug your code carefully to ensure that it is correct. This can be done by running your code on a few test cases and checking the results. You can also use a debugger to help you track down errors in your code.

Title:
AIZU p00175 Quaternary Notation

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type**

The input data is an integer, but if the developer mistakenly uses a floating-point type, the program will not work correctly.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The correct algorithm for converting a decimal number to a quaternary number is to repeatedly divide the number by 4 and take the remainder. However, if the developer uses an incorrect algorithm, the program will not work correctly.

**3. Using an incorrect output format**

The output of the program should be a quaternary number, but if the developer outputs the number in the wrong format, the program will not be correct.

**4. Not handling the end of input correctly**

The end of input is indicated by a single line of -1. If the developer does not handle this case correctly, the program will not work correctly.

**5. Not handling invalid input correctly**

The input data may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers greater than 1000000. If the developer does not handle these cases correctly, the program will not work correctly.

Title:
AIZU p01364 Two-Wheel Buggy

Pain points:
1. Possible bugs:
    * Incorrect calculation of the final position of the buggy.
    * Incorrect handling of input data.
    * Incorrect handling of edge cases.
    * Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.
    * Incorrect use of the math library.
    * Incorrect use of the standard library.
    * Incorrect use of the programming language.
2. Most important problems:
    * The most important problem is to correctly calculate the final position of the buggy. This requires careful consideration of the kinematics of the buggy and the effects of the instructions on its motion.
    * Another important problem is to correctly handle input data. This includes ensuring that the input data is valid and that it is interpreted correctly.
    * Edge cases are also an important consideration. For example, what happens if the buggy is given an instruction to rotate at a speed that is greater than its maximum speed?
3. Solutions:
    * To correctly calculate the final position of the buggy, we can use the following steps:
        1. Calculate the angular velocity of each wheel.
        2. Calculate the distance traveled by each wheel.
        3. Calculate the new position of the center of the axle.
    * To correctly handle input data, we can use the following steps:
        1. Check that the input data is valid.
        2. Parse the input data into a format that can be used by the program.
    * To correctly handle edge cases, we can use the following steps:
        1. Define the maximum speed of the buggy.
        2. Throw an exception if an instruction is given to rotate the buggy at a speed that is greater than its maximum speed.
4. Examples:
    * The following is an example of a correct solution to the problem:
```

Title:
AIZU p01982 Generalized Leap Years

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correct. For example, the input "3 1988 2014 400 100 Four" is incorrect because it has an extra space between "100" and "Four". The developer should make sure to check the input format before processing it.

**2. Incorrect calculation**

The developer may make mistakes when calculating the number of generalized leap years. For example, the developer may incorrectly calculate the number of generalized leap years in the range [1988, 2014] for the input "3 1988 2014 400 100 Four". The correct answer is 7, but the developer may incorrectly calculate it as 6.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

The developer may make off-by-one errors when calculating the number of generalized leap years. For example, the developer may incorrectly calculate the number of generalized leap years in the range [1111, 3333] for the input "2 1111 3333 2 2". The correct answer is 2223, but the developer may incorrectly calculate it as 2222.

**4. Undefined behavior**

The developer may encounter undefined behavior when processing the input. For example, the developer may encounter undefined behavior when trying to divide by zero. The developer should make sure to handle undefined behavior correctly.

**5. Memory leaks**

The developer may create memory leaks when processing the input. For example, the developer may create a memory leak when allocating a new array. The developer should make sure to free all allocated memory when it is no longer needed.

Title:
AIZU p02128 Light

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of data types**

When dealing with numerical data, it is important to use the correct data type. In this problem, the input values are integers, so it is important to use `int` or `long` data types when storing them. Using a data type that is too small can lead to errors, such as overflow.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that occurs when a programmer forgets to account for the first or last element in a list or array. In this problem, it is important to make sure that the indices of the streetlights are correct. For example, if the first streetlight is at $(1, 1)$, then the index of that streetlight should be 0, not 1.

**3. Incorrect use of loops**

Loops are a powerful tool for iterating over a collection of data, but they can also be a source of errors. In this problem, it is important to make sure that the loops are terminated correctly. For example, if the number of streetlights is not known in advance, then the loop should be terminated when the end of the input is reached.

**4. Incorrect use of functions**

Functions are a powerful tool for abstracting away complex code, but they can also be a source of errors. In this problem, it is important to make sure that the functions are used correctly. For example, if a function is supposed to return the minimum value of a list, then it is important to make sure that the function actually returns the minimum value.

**5. Logical errors**

Logical errors are a type of error that occurs when the logic of a program is incorrect. In this problem, it is important to make sure that the program is correct. For example, if the program is supposed to find the minimum value of a list, then it is important to make sure that the program actually finds the minimum value.

Title:
AIZU p02269 Dictionary

Pain points:
no
yes
yes
 **1. Off-by-one errors**

When using an array to store the dictionary, it is important to make sure that the index of each element is correct. A common mistake is to forget to add 1 to the index when inserting a new element, or to subtract 1 when finding an element. This can result in the incorrect insertion or deletion of elements from the dictionary.

**2. Mismatched data types**

The data types of the elements in the dictionary must be consistent. For example, if the dictionary is storing strings, then all of the elements must be strings. If the data types are not consistent, then the program may not work correctly.

**3. Undefined behavior**

Undefined behavior occurs when the compiler is not able to determine the outcome of a program. This can happen when the program accesses a memory location that is not valid, or when the program divides by zero. Undefined behavior can lead to unexpected results, such as the program crashing or producing incorrect output.

**4. Memory leaks**

A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing. Memory leaks can be difficult to track down, so it is important to be aware of them and to take steps to avoid them.

**5. Security vulnerabilities**

A security vulnerability is a weakness in a program that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system. Security vulnerabilities can be introduced in a variety of ways, such as through incorrect input validation or insecure coding practices. It is important to be aware of security vulnerabilities and to take steps to protect your programs from attack.

For example, the input could contain a newline character after the last integer, or it could contain spaces between the digits of the integer.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the sum of digits**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the sum of digits by adding the digits in the wrong order, or by adding the digits more than once.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly specified, so it is possible that the developer will write code that will not produce the correct output for all possible inputs. For example, the output could contain a newline character after the sum of digits, or it could contain spaces between the digits of the sum.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer may make off-by-one errors when calculating the sum of digits, or when counting the number of digits in the integer.
5. **Memory errors**. The developer may not allocate enough memory to store the input integer, or the sum of digits. This could cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect output.
6. **Timeout errors**. The developer may not write code that runs in a reasonable amount of time. This could cause the program to time out and to produce an error message.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer may write code that is vulnerable to security attacks, such as buffer overflows or SQL injection attacks. This could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program's data or to the system on which it is running.
