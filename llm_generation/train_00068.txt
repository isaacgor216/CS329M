CODECHEF bintree

Pain points:
For second query, 2 and 3 are 2 hops apart.
For third query, 4 and 3 are 3 hops apart. **1. Using the wrong data type for storing the tree**

The tree in this problem is infinite, so we need to use a data type that can store arbitrarily large integers. If we use a data type like `int`, we will eventually run into an overflow error.

**2. Not using a recursive solution**

The problem asks us to find the shortest path between two nodes in the tree. A recursive solution is the most natural way to do this. A non-recursive solution is possible, but it is much more complex and error-prone.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The correct algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a binary tree is Dijkstra's algorithm. If we use a different algorithm, we may not get the correct answer.

**4. Not handling the corner cases correctly**

The problem specifies that the tree is infinite, and that the nodes are labelled from 1 to 10^9. We need to make sure that our solution handles these corner cases correctly.

**5. Not testing your code thoroughly**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed.

The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or the number of segments may be less than 1 or greater than 1000.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not strictly followed. For example, the output may not be a single integer, or the integer may be negative.

**3. Segments that intersect with each other**

The problem statement states that no two segments lie on the same line. However, it is possible for two segments to intersect with each other. This can lead to incorrect results if the algorithm does not properly handle intersecting segments.

**4. Segments that are not covered by any points**

The problem statement states that the segments are covered by at least one point. However, it is possible for a segment to not be covered by any points. This can lead to incorrect results if the algorithm does not properly handle segments that are not covered by any points.

**5. Segments that are not distinct**

The problem statement states that the segments are distinct. However, it is possible for two segments to be identical. This can lead to incorrect results if the algorithm does not properly handle segments that are not distinct.

**6. Segments that are not in the correct order**

The problem statement states that the segments are given in order. However, it is possible for the segments to be given in a different order. This can lead to incorrect results if the algorithm does not properly handle segments that are not in the correct order.

**7. Segments that are not in the correct format**

The problem statement states that the segments are given in the format (Ax, Ay, Bx, By). However, it is possible for the segments to be given in a different format. This can lead to incorrect results if the algorithm does not properly handle segments that are not in the correct format.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1059_D. Nature Reserve

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading the input data. For example, you might accidentally miss a space between two numbers, or you might put the numbers in the wrong order. This can cause the program to crash or to output incorrect results.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When you're working with arrays or lists, it's easy to make a mistake and access an element that's one index off from where you intended. This can cause the program to crash or to output incorrect results.
3. **Arithmetic errors.** When you're doing calculations, it's easy to make a mistake and get the wrong answer. This can cause the program to crash or to output incorrect results.
4. **Logic errors.** When you're writing the logic for your program, it's easy to make a mistake and have the program do something that you didn't intend. This can cause the program to crash or to output incorrect results.
5. **Undefined behavior.** When you're writing C++, it's important to be aware of undefined behavior. This is behavior that the compiler is not required to guarantee, and it can lead to unexpected results. For example, if you try to divide a number by zero, the compiler is not required to throw an error. This can cause your program to crash or to output incorrect results.

To avoid these problems, it's important to carefully read the problem statement and to make sure that you understand the input format and the output format. You should also carefully write your code and test it thoroughly. By following these steps, you can help to ensure that your program is correct and that it outputs the correct results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1080_F. Katya and Segments Sets

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correct, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input format is incorrect, the program may try to read a number from a string, which will cause an error.
* **Incorrect data type:** The data type of the input may be incorrect, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input is a string, but the program tries to convert it to an integer, an error will occur.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic of the program may be incorrect, which may cause the program to give incorrect results. For example, if the program does not check for all possible cases, it may give incorrect results.
* **Off-by-one errors:** Off-by-one errors are common mistakes that can cause the program to give incorrect results. For example, if the program iterates over a list of numbers, but it starts at the wrong index, it may miss some numbers or include some numbers twice.
* **Memory leaks:** Memory leaks occur when the program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
* **Race conditions:** Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to give incorrect results or crash.
* **Deadlocks:** Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely.
* **Stack overflows:** Stack overflows occur when the program uses up all of the available stack space. This can cause the program to crash.
* **Buffer overflows:** Buffer overflows occur when the program writes data to a buffer that is not large enough. This can cause the program to crash or give incorrect results.
* **Format string vulnerabilities:** Format string vulnerabilities occur when the program uses a format string that is not properly sanitized. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

CODEFORCES 1121_D. Diana and Liana

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format specified in the problem statement is very strict. Make sure that your code correctly parses the input data.

**2. Mismatch between input and output**

The output of your code should match the expected output format. Make sure that you are not missing or adding any characters to the output.

**3. Incorrect logic**

Your code may contain bugs in the logic that you used to solve the problem. This could be due to a mistake in your algorithm, or a misunderstanding of the problem statement.

**4. Runtime error**

Your code may run into a runtime error if it tries to access an invalid memory location, or if it makes an infinite loop. Make sure that your code is well-structured and that you are using the correct data types.

**5. Time complexity**

Your code may not be efficient enough to pass the time limit for the problem. Make sure that you are using an efficient algorithm, and that you are not doing unnecessary work.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1148_F. Foo Fighters

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data contains a lot of integers. If you use an incorrect data type to store them, you may get an overflow error. For example, if you use `int` to store `val_i`, you may get an overflow error when `val_i` is very large.

**2. Not considering the sign of the sum of prices**

The problem statement says that the sum of all prices is initially non-zero. However, you may forget to consider the sign of the sum of prices. For example, if the sum of prices is negative, you may print a positive integer `s`. This will not change the sign of the sum of prices.

**3. Not considering all possible values of `s`**

The problem statement says that there is always at least one valid `s`. However, you may only consider a few possible values of `s`. For example, you may only consider `s` that are powers of 2. This may not be enough to find a valid `s`.

**4. Not using the bitwise AND operator correctly**

The problem statement says that you need to compute the bitwise AND of `s` and `mask_i`. However, you may not use the bitwise AND operator correctly. For example, you may use the bitwise OR operator instead of the bitwise AND operator. This will not give you the correct result.

**5. Not handling special cases correctly**

The problem statement says that `val_i` can be negative. However, you may not handle negative values of `val_i` correctly. For example, you may try to print a negative value of `s`. This will cause a compilation error.

**6. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved in O(n) time. However, you may use a less efficient algorithm. For example, you may use a brute-force algorithm. This will take O(n^2) time.

Title:
CODEFORCES 116_C. Party

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of integers. If the developer uses an incorrect data type to store the input data, it may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the developer uses a string to store the input data, it will not be able to correctly parse the data and will return an incorrect result.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the developer may use a brute force algorithm to solve the problem, which will be very inefficient. A more efficient algorithm would be to use a greedy algorithm.

**3. Not handling special cases**

The developer may not handle special cases correctly. For example, the developer may not handle the case where the input data is empty.

**4. Insufficient testing**

The developer may not test the code sufficiently. This may lead to bugs that are not caught until the code is deployed to production. It is important to test the code with a variety of input data, including both valid and invalid data.

**5. Not following coding standards**

The developer may not follow coding standards. This may make the code difficult to read and maintain. It is important to follow coding standards to ensure that the code is readable and maintainable.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1188_B. Count Pairs

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple but efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given integer. It works by iteratively marking all multiples of each prime number as composite, until all composite numbers have been marked. However, if the implementation is not correct, it is possible to miss some prime numbers or mark some composite numbers as prime. This can lead to incorrect results in problems that require the use of the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
2. **Incorrect use of modular arithmetic.** Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic in which the values of the operands are reduced modulo a given integer, called the modulus. This can be used to simplify certain calculations, such as finding the remainder of a division operation. However, it is important to be careful when using modular arithmetic, as it is easy to make mistakes. For example, if you are adding two numbers modulo a prime number, the result will always be less than the modulus. This is because the modulus is the highest possible value that can be added to or subtracted from a number without changing its value.
3. **Incorrect use of the Chinese remainder theorem.** The Chinese remainder theorem is a theorem in number theory that allows you to find the unique solution to a system of linear congruences. This can be useful for solving problems that involve finding the number of solutions to a given equation modulo a set of integers. However, it is important to be careful when using the Chinese remainder theorem, as it is easy to make mistakes. For example, if you are using the Chinese remainder theorem to find the number of solutions to an equation modulo a set of integers, you must make sure that the integers in the set are pairwise coprime. This means that they have no common factors other than 1.
4. **Incorrect use of the Extended Euclidean algorithm.** The Extended Euclidean algorithm is an algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. It can also be used to find the multiplicative inverse of one integer modulo another integer. However, it is important to be careful when using the Extended Euclidean algorithm, as it is easy to make mistakes. For example, if you are using the Extended Euclidean algorithm to find the multiplicative inverse of an integer modulo another integer, you must make sure that the modulus is not zero.
5. **Incorrect use of the Fast Fourier transform (FFT).** The Fast Fourier transform (FFT) is a fast algorithm for computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence of numbers. This can be useful for solving problems that involve finding the frequencies of a signal. However, it is important to be careful when using the FFT, as it is easy to make mistakes. For example, if you are using the FFT to find the frequencies of a signal, you must make sure that the signal is properly padded. This means that the signal must be extended with zeros so that its length is a power of 2.

CODEFORCES 1249_F. Maximum Weight Subset

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the tree data structure.** The tree data structure is a fundamental part of this problem, and any errors in its implementation will lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm for finding the maximum weight subset.** The algorithm for finding the maximum weight subset is the other key part of this problem, and any errors in its implementation will also lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement specifies a few edge cases that must be handled correctly, such as the case where the tree has no edges or the case where the distance restriction is 0. Any errors in handling these edge cases will lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect input validation.** The problem statement specifies that the input must be in a certain format. Any errors in input validation will lead to incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect output formatting.** The problem statement specifies that the output must be in a certain format. Any errors in output formatting will lead to incorrect results.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

1. **A developer might incorrectly implement the tree data structure by using a linked list instead of an adjacency list. This would lead to incorrect results because a linked list does not support efficient traversal of the tree.**
2. **A developer might incorrectly implement the algorithm for finding the maximum weight subset by using a greedy algorithm. This would lead to incorrect results because a greedy algorithm does not always find the optimal solution.**
3. **A developer might incorrectly handle the edge case where the tree has no edges by returning the sum of all the weights of the vertices. This would lead to incorrect results because the maximum weight subset in this case is the empty set.**
4. **A developer might incorrectly handle the edge case where the distance restriction is 0 by returning the sum of all the weights of the edges. This would lead to incorrect results because the maximum weight subset in this case is the set of all the vertices.**
5. **A developer might incorrectly validate the input by failing to check that the number of vertices is positive. This would lead to incorrect results because the problem statement specifies that the number of vertices must be positive.**
6. **A developer might incorrectly format the output by failing to use the correct number of digits for the weights of the vertices. This would lead to incorrect results because the problem statement specifies that the output must be formatted in a certain way.**

Title:
CODEFORCES 1310_E. Strange Function

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the `f` function.** The `f` function should take a multiset as input and return a multiset of the number of occurrences of each element in the input multiset. For example, `f({5, 5, 1, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 5})` should return `{1, 1, 2, 2, 4}`.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the `f^k` function.** The `f^k` function should take an array as input and return the multiset of the number of occurrences of each element in the array after applying the `f` function `k` times. For example, `f^2({5, 5, 1, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 5})` should return `{1, 2, 2}`.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving problems. It is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output format. Make sure that your algorithm is correct before submitting your solution.
2. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem statement specifies that the input contains n points, each of which has three coordinates. It is important to use a data structure that can store n points efficiently. For example, you could use a vector of structs or a 2D array.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** It is easy to make a mistake when computing the indices of elements in a data structure. For example, you might accidentally index one element past the end of the array. Be careful to check your indices carefully to avoid this type of error.
4. **Arithmetic overflow.** When computing the number of rectangles, it is possible to overflow the integer type. To avoid this, you can use the `long long` type or the `mod` operator.
5. **Incorrect modular arithmetic.** When computing the number of rectangles, it is important to use the correct modular arithmetic. For example, you might accidentally compute the number of rectangles modulo n instead of modulo 10^9 + 7.
6. **Memory leaks.** It is important to free any memory that you allocate during the execution of your program. If you do not free the memory, your program may eventually run out of memory and crash.
7. **Incorrect use of exceptions.** Exceptions can be a useful tool for handling errors in your program. However, it is important to use them correctly. For example, you should not throw an exception from a destructor.
8. **Incorrect use of threads.** Threads can be a powerful tool for parallelizing your code. However, it is important to use them correctly. For example, you should not access shared data from multiple threads without synchronization.
9. **Incorrect use of locks.** Locks can be a useful tool for preventing race conditions. However, it is important to use them correctly. For example, you should not hold a lock for longer than necessary.
10. **Incorrect use of mutexes.** Mutexes can be a useful tool for synchronizing access to shared data. However, it is important to use them correctly. For example, you should not lock a mutex that is already locked.

### 1. **Invalid queries**

The grader will reject queries that do not follow the specified format. For example, queries with duplicate labels, queries with labels that are not in the range `[1, n]`, or queries with labels that do not form a tree. If the grader rejects your query, it will print `-1` and your submission will receive a `Wrong answer` verdict.

To avoid invalid queries, make sure that your code correctly validates the input before making any queries.

### 2. **Excessive queries**

The grader will also reject submissions that make more than `n + 420` queries. If your submission exceeds this limit, the grader will print `-1` and your submission will receive a `Wrong answer` verdict.

To avoid making excessive queries, make sure that your code terminates after finding the root of the tree.

### 3. **Incorrect output**

The grader will reject submissions that do not output the correct answer. The correct answer is the label of the root of the tree.

To avoid incorrect output, make sure that your code correctly identifies the root of the tree and outputs its label.

### 4. **Other errors**

There are a number of other errors that can occur when solving this problem. For example, your code may crash, it may run out of memory, or it may produce incorrect output for valid inputs.

To avoid these errors, make sure that your code is well-written and well-tested.

CODEFORCES 148_E. Porcelain

Pain points:
**1. Mismatched types**

The input is a list of integers, but the output is a string. This could be fixed by casting the output to a string.

**2. Index out of bounds**

The code iterates over the list of shelves, but it does not check if the index is out of bounds. This could be fixed by adding an `if` statement to check if the index is less than the length of the list.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the maximum value**

The code calculates the maximum value by adding the values of the first `m` items in the list. However, this does not take into account the fact that some of the items may be negative. This could be fixed by adding a check to see if the value of an item is negative, and if so, not adding it to the total.

**4. Inefficient algorithm**

The code iterates over the list of shelves multiple times. This could be improved by using a more efficient algorithm, such as a binary search.

Title:
CODEFORCES 259_E. Little Elephant and LCM

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**

The modulo operator (%) is used to find the remainder of a division. For example, 10 % 3 = 1, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1. However, it is important to remember that the modulo operator only works with integers. If you try to use the modulo operator with a floating-point number, you will get an error.

**2. Using the wrong data type**

The data type of a variable determines the type of values that can be stored in that variable. For example, the int data type can store whole numbers, while the float data type can store fractional numbers. It is important to use the correct data type for each variable, or you may get unexpected results.

**3. Not initializing variables**

When you declare a variable, you must also initialize it with a value. If you do not initialize a variable, it will contain an arbitrary value, which may lead to errors.

**4. Using uninitialized variables**

Once you have initialized a variable, you must not use it before it has been assigned a value. If you do, you will get an error.

**5. Using the wrong variable**

It is important to make sure that you are using the correct variable when you are writing your code. If you use the wrong variable, you may get unexpected results.

**6. Forgetting to close files**

When you open a file in your code, you must also close it when you are finished with it. If you do not close a file, it may remain open and consume resources.

**7. Using too much memory**

Your code should be as efficient as possible, so it is important to avoid using too much memory. If your code uses too much memory, it may slow down your program or even crash it.

**8. Not handling errors properly**

Your code should be able to handle errors gracefully. If an error occurs, your code should either try to recover from the error or report it to the user.

**9. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before you deploy it. This will help you to catch any bugs and ensure that your code is working correctly.

**10. Not documenting your code**

Title:
CODEFORCES 353_C. Find Maximum

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading in the data. For example, if you forget to include a space between two numbers, or if you include a newline character in the middle of a number, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect calculation of f(x).** The formula for f(x) is a bit tricky, and it's easy to make a mistake when implementing it. For example, you might forget to add the carry when adding two numbers, or you might use the wrong index when accessing an element of the array.
3. **Incorrect output format.** The output for this problem should be a single integer, which is the maximum value of f(x) for all 0 ≤ x ≤ m. Make sure to format your output correctly, or the judge will not accept it.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** This problem is particularly prone to off-by-one errors, because the indices of the elements in the array are not always consecutive. For example, if n = 5, then the indices of the elements in the array are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. However, the indices of the bits in the binary representation of m are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, so it's easy to make a mistake when calculating f(x).
5. **Memory leaks.** This problem does not require you to allocate any memory, but it's still possible to create a memory leak if you're not careful. For example, if you create a temporary variable and then forget to delete it, the variable will remain in memory until the program terminates, which can lead to a memory leak.

CODEFORCES 448_E. Divisors

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be a single line containing two space-separated integers — X (1 ≤ X ≤ 1012) and k (0 ≤ k ≤ 1018). If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the sequence Xk**. The sequence Xk is defined recursively as X0 = [X], Xi = f(Xi - 1) (i > 0). To calculate the sequence Xk, we need to first calculate X0, then X1, and so on. If the calculation is incorrect, the program will output incorrect results.
3. **Memory overflow**. The output can be rather large, so it is important to use an efficient data structure to store the sequence Xk. If the data structure is not efficient, the program may run out of memory.
4. **Timeout**. The program should be able to finish within the time limit. If the program takes too long to run, it will be timed out.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format, the calculation of the sequence Xk, and the data structure used to store the sequence Xk. It is also important to optimize the program to run as efficiently as possible.

CODEFORCES 46_F. Hercule Poirot Problem

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

1. **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible that the input will not be in the correct format. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data:** The data provided in the input may be incorrect. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect logic:** The logic used by the program to solve the problem may be incorrect. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect implementation:** The program may be incorrectly implemented. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format, the data provided, and the logic used by the program. It is also important to carefully implement the program.

Here are some specific examples of problems that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* The input may not be in the correct format. For example, the number of rooms, doors, or residents may be incorrect.
* The data provided may be incorrect. For example, a door may connect two rooms that are not adjacent.
* The logic used by the program to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the program may not correctly account for the fact that a person can only open a door if they have the key to that door.
* The program may be incorrectly implemented. For example, the program may not correctly handle errors.

By carefully checking the input format, the data provided, and the logic used by the program, and by carefully implementing the program, it is possible to avoid these problems and bugs.

CODEFORCES 493_B. Vasya and Wrestling

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation of points**. The program may incorrectly calculate the total number of points for each wrestler, which will lead to the wrong answer. For example, if the program does not take into account the negative signs of the points, it will incorrectly calculate the total number of points for the second wrestler.
3. **Incorrect comparison of sequences**. The program may incorrectly compare the sequences of points for the two wrestlers, which will lead to the wrong answer. For example, if the program does not take into account the order of the points in the sequences, it may incorrectly determine which wrestler has the greater number of points.
4. **Incorrect output**. The program may incorrectly output the winner of the wrestling match, which will lead to the wrong answer. For example, if the program outputs "first" when the second wrestler actually won, it will give the wrong answer.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully follow the input format and to correctly calculate the total number of points for each wrestler. It is also important to correctly compare the sequences of points for the two wrestlers and to correctly output the winner of the wrestling match.

Title:
CODEFORCES 570_C. Replacement

Pain points:
**1. Using a brute force approach**

A brute force approach would be to iterate over all substrings of length 2 in the string, and check if each substring contains two consecutive periods. If a substring contains two consecutive periods, then increment the number of replacement operations by 1.

This approach is inefficient because it iterates over all substrings of length 2 in the string, even if the string does not contain any two consecutive periods.

**2. Using a dynamic programming approach**

A dynamic programming approach would be to create a table of size n + 1, where n is the length of the string. The table would be indexed by the position in the string, and the value at each index would be the minimum number of replacement operations required to make the substring from the beginning of the string to the current index free of two consecutive periods.

The table can be filled in using the following recursive formula:

```
f(i) = min(f(i - 1), f(i - 2) + 1) if s[i] == '.' and s[i - 1] == '.'
f(i) = f(i - 1) otherwise
```

The base cases for the recursion are f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1.

This approach is more efficient than the brute force approach because it only iterates over the substrings of length 2 that actually contain two consecutive periods.

**3. Using a greedy approach**

A greedy approach would be to iterate over the string from left to right, and replace each pair of consecutive periods with a single period. This approach would not be optimal in general, but it would be efficient for strings that do not contain many pairs of consecutive periods.

**4. Using a heuristic approach**

A heuristic approach would be to try to remove as many pairs of consecutive periods as possible by replacing each pair of consecutive periods with a single period. This approach would not be optimal in general, but it could be efficient for strings that contain many pairs of consecutive periods.

**5. Using a hybrid approach**

A hybrid approach would be to use a combination of the brute force approach, the dynamic programming approach, the greedy approach, and the heuristic approach to find an efficient solution to the problem.

**6. Using a divide and conquer approach**

A divide and conquer approach would be to divide the string into two substrings, and then solve the problem recursively for each substring. The solution for the entire string would then be the sum of the solutions for the two substrings.

This approach is efficient for strings that are already sorted or partially sorted.

**7. Using a randomized approach**

A randomized approach would be to randomly generate a solution to the problem, and then check if the solution is valid. If the solution is valid, then return it. Otherwise, generate a new solution and repeat the process.

This approach is not guaranteed to find an optimal solution to the problem, but it is likely to find a good solution in a reasonable amount of time.

CODEFORCES 592_A. PawnChess

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect board input**

The input board should be a 8x8 array of characters, where 'B' represents a black pawn, 'W' represents a white pawn, and '.' represents an empty cell. If the input board is not a 8x8 array, or if it contains any characters other than 'B', 'W', or '.', the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect pawn movement**

The pawns can only move one step at a time, and they can only move up or down. If a pawn tries to move more than one step, or if it tries to move in a direction other than up or down, the program will crash.

**3. Incorrect player turn**

The players take turns moving their pawns. Player A moves first, then Player B moves, and so on. If a player tries to move their pawn when it is not their turn, the program will crash.

**4. Undeclared variables**

All variables used in the program must be declared before they are used. If a variable is used before it is declared, the program will crash.

**5. Undefined functions**

Any functions used in the program must be defined before they are called. If a function is called before it is defined, the program will crash.

**6. Off-by-one errors**

When iterating over the board, it is important to make sure that the indices are correct. If the indices are off by one, the program will crash.

**7. Incorrect logic**

The logic of the program must be correct. If the logic is incorrect, the program will not produce the correct output.

**8. Uncaught exceptions**

The program should catch any exceptions that are thrown. If an exception is not caught, the program will crash.
Test inputs:
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Declare the board.
    char board[8][8];

    // Read the board from the input.
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
        scanf(" %s ", board[i]);
    }

    // Check if there are any white pawns on the first row.
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
        if (board[0][i] == 'W') {
            // Player A wins.
            printf(" A ");
            return 0;

Title:
CODEFORCES 613_D. Kingdom and its Cities

Pain points:
1. **Inefficient graph traversal**. If you iterate over all the edges in the graph, you will have to do O(n^2) work. This can be improved by using a disjoint set data structure to find connected components in the graph.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of cities to capture**. If you only consider the cities that are adjacent to important cities, you may miss some cities that can be captured to isolate the important cities. To avoid this, you need to consider all the cities in the graph.
3. **Incorrect handling of disconnected graphs**. If the graph is disconnected, you need to handle each connected component separately.
4. **Incorrect handling of plans with duplicate important cities**. If a plan contains duplicate important cities, you need to make sure that you only count each city once when calculating the minimum number of cities to capture.
5. **Incorrect handling of plans with self-loops**. If a plan contains a self-loop, you need to make sure that you do not count the city that is the target of the self-loop when calculating the minimum number of cities to capture.

To avoid these problems, you can use the following strategies:

1. Use a disjoint set data structure to find connected components in the graph. This will allow you to iterate over all the cities in the graph in O(n) time.
2. When calculating the minimum number of cities to capture, consider all the cities in the graph, not just the cities that are adjacent to important cities.
3. If the graph is disconnected, handle each connected component separately.
4. Make sure that you only count each city once when calculating the minimum number of cities to capture.
5. Make sure that you do not count the city that is the target of a self-loop when calculating the minimum number of cities to capture.

Title:
CODEFORCES 633_D. Fibonacci-ish

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Fibonacci sequence.** The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. For example, the Fibonacci sequence is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ... The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are arbitrary, so you can start with any two numbers you want. However, once you start the sequence, you must continue to add the two previous numbers to get the next number in the sequence.
2. **Using an incorrect data structure to store the Fibonacci sequence.** The Fibonacci sequence is a very long sequence, so you need to use a data structure that can store a large number of elements. A simple array is not a good choice, because it will only be able to store a limited number of elements. A better choice would be to use a linked list or a hash table.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm to find the longest Fibonacci-ish prefix.** The longest Fibonacci-ish prefix is the longest subsequence of the Fibonacci sequence that is also a subsequence of the given sequence. There are a number of different algorithms that you can use to find the longest Fibonacci-ish prefix. One simple algorithm is to start with the first two elements of the Fibonacci sequence and then iteratively add the next element in the Fibonacci sequence if it is also an element of the given sequence.
4. **Incorrectly handling the case where the given sequence does not contain any Fibonacci numbers.** If the given sequence does not contain any Fibonacci numbers, then the longest Fibonacci-ish prefix will be the empty sequence. You need to make sure to handle this case correctly in your code.
5. **Incorrectly handling the case where the given sequence contains duplicate Fibonacci numbers.** If the given sequence contains duplicate Fibonacci numbers, then you need to make sure to only include the first occurrence of each Fibonacci number in the longest Fibonacci-ish prefix.
6. **Incorrectly handling the case where the given sequence is not sorted.** The Fibonacci sequence is a sorted sequence, so you need to make sure that the given sequence is also sorted before you try to find the longest Fibonacci-ish prefix.
7. **Incorrectly handling the case where the given sequence is too short.** If the given sequence is too short, then there will be no Fibonacci-ish prefix. You need to make sure to handle this case correctly in your code.
Test inputs:

CODEFORCES 709_A. Juicer

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specified in the problem statement is `n, b, d a1, a2, ..., an`. However, a developer may accidentally write the input format as `n, b, d, a1, a2, ..., an`. This will cause the program to crash because the first `d` characters in the input will be interpreted as the first integer `n`.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The problem statement specifies that the input integers `n`, `b`, `d`, and `ai` should be of type `int`. However, a developer may accidentally declare them as type `float` or `string`. This will cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one error.** The developer may accidentally miscalculate the number of times the waste section needs to be emptied. For example, if the input is `2 7 10` and the oranges are `5` and `6`, the developer may incorrectly calculate that the waste section needs to be emptied once, when it actually needs to be emptied twice.
4. **Infinite loop.** The developer may accidentally create an infinite loop in their code. For example, the following code will create an infinite loop:

```
while True:
  # Do something
```
5. **Memory leak.** The developer may accidentally create a memory leak in their code. For example, the following code will create a memory leak:

```
def my_function():
  # Allocate some memory
  return memory

my_function()
```

The `my_function()` function allocates memory but does not free it, so the memory will never be returned to the operating system. This can eventually lead to a memory leak.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is given in the form of a text file. The developer may incorrectly parse the input data and get incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. This can lead to incorrect results or a time limit exceeded error.
3. **Incorrect implementation**. The developer may make a mistake in implementing the algorithm. This can lead to incorrect results or a time limit exceeded error.
4. **Memory leak**. The developer may not properly manage memory, which can lead to a memory leak. This can cause the program to crash or run out of memory.
5. **Synchronization issues**. The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared resources, which can lead to race conditions or deadlocks. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
6. **Unit tests**. The developer may not write unit tests to verify the correctness of their code. This can lead to bugs that are not caught until the code is deployed in production.
7. **Integration tests**. The developer may not write integration tests to verify the correctness of their code when it is integrated with other systems. This can lead to bugs that are not caught until the code is deployed in production.
8. **Deployment issues**. The developer may not properly deploy their code to production. This can lead to bugs that are not caught until users encounter them.
9. **Configuration issues**. The developer may not properly configure their environment. This can lead to bugs that are not caught until users encounter them.
10. **User errors**. Users may not use the system correctly. This can lead to bugs that are not the fault of the developer.

CODEFORCES 753_A. Santa Claus and Candies

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be a single line containing a positive integer number n. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be two lines. The first line should contain a single integer number k, which is the maximum number of children who can get candies. The second line should contain k distinct integer numbers, which are the number of candies for each of the k children. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly print the output and will likely crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program should first find the maximum number of children who can get candies by finding the prime factorization of n. Then, it should print the k distinct integer numbers that represent the number of candies for each of the k children. If the logic is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly find the maximum number of children who can get candies or print the k distinct integer numbers.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. When finding the prime factorization of n, it is important to make sure that all of the prime factors are included. If a prime factor is missed, the program will not be able to correctly find the maximum number of children who can get candies. Additionally, when printing the k distinct integer numbers, it is important to make sure that the numbers are in ascending order. If the numbers are not in ascending order, the program will not be able to correctly print the output.
5. **Memory errors**. If the program does not properly manage its memory, it may run out of memory and crash. This can happen if the program tries to allocate too much memory or if it does not free up memory that is no longer needed.
6. **Time complexity**. The program should run in O(n) time, where n is the number of candies Santa Claus has. If the program runs in more than O(n) time, it will be too slow to solve large problems.

Title:
CODEFORCES 892_B. Wrath

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data contains integers of type `int`, but the developer may mistakenly use a smaller data type, such as `short` or `char`. This will cause the program to overflow and produce incorrect results.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The correct algorithm for solving this problem is to use a stack. The developer may mistakenly use a different algorithm, such as a linked list or a queue, which will not produce the correct results.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

The input data may contain edge cases, such as a list of all zeros or a list of all ones. The developer must make sure to handle these cases correctly, or the program will crash or produce incorrect results.

**4. Using incorrect variable names**

The developer must use descriptive variable names to make the code easy to read and understand. Using incorrect variable names can make the code difficult to debug and maintain.

**5. Forgetting to comment the code**

Title:
CODEFORCES 914_B. Conan and Agasa play a Card Game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly calculating the minimum card value.** The minimum card value is the smallest card value that is still in the game. A common mistake is to calculate the minimum card value by looking at the first card in the input list. However, this is incorrect because cards can be removed from the game in the middle of the game. The correct way to calculate the minimum card value is to iterate through the input list and keep track of the smallest card value that you have seen so far.
2. **Not considering all possible cases.** When solving a problem, it is important to consider all possible cases. For example, in this problem, we need to consider the case where Conan and Agasa both have the same minimum card value. In this case, the game will end in a tie.
3. **Using incorrect data types.** When solving a problem, it is important to use the correct data types. For example, in this problem, we need to use integers to represent the card values. Using floating-point numbers would be incorrect because floating-point numbers can be inaccurate.
4. **Making off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that occurs when you forget to increment or decrement a variable by one. For example, in this problem, you might forget to increment the index of the card that you are currently looking at. This would result in you incorrectly calculating the minimum card value.
5. **Using inefficient algorithms.** When solving a problem, it is important to use efficient algorithms. For example, in this problem, you could use a binary search to find the minimum card value. Using a linear search would be inefficient.

Title:
CODEFORCES 936_D. World of Tank

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to put a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program is very complex, and it is easy to make a mistake. For example, you might forget to check if the tank is in a safe position before shooting, or you might not correctly calculate the number of shots that the tank needs to make.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when printing the output. For example, you might forget to put a newline character between two lines, or you might not print the output in the correct order.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program might allocate memory that it does not need, or it might not free memory that it has allocated. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
5. **Race conditions**. The program might be running multiple threads at the same time, and it is important to make sure that the threads do not interfere with each other. For example, you might need to use locks to protect shared data.
6. **Synchronization issues**. The program might need to wait for other threads to finish before it can continue. For example, you might need to use a condition variable to wait for a thread to finish.
7. **Deadlocks**. The program might deadlock if two threads are waiting for each other to finish. For example, you might have two threads that are both waiting for a lock that the other thread is holding.
8. **Buffer overflows**. The program might write more data to a buffer than it can hold. This can lead to the program crashing or corrupting data.
9. **Format string vulnerabilities**. The program might use a format string that is not properly sanitized. This can lead to the program being exploited by attackers.
10. **SQL injection vulnerabilities**. The program might not properly sanitize user input before using it in a SQL statement. This can lead to the program being exploited by attackers.

Title:
HACKEREARTH angles-2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly reading the input format.** The input format is "N K\nangles\nangles". The first line contains two integers N and K, separated by a space. The second line contains N space-separated integers, which are the angles that Raju knows how to draw. The third line contains K space-separated integers, which are the angles that Rani wants Raju to draw. A developer may incorrectly read the input format and try to parse the first line as a single integer, or they may incorrectly parse the second or third line as a single integer.
2. **Incorrectly computing the possible angles that Raju can draw.** Raju can draw any angle that is the sum or difference of two of the angles that he knows how to draw. A developer may incorrectly compute the possible angles that Raju can draw, or they may incorrectly check whether a given angle is one of the possible angles.
3. **Incorrectly outputting the answer.** The output should be a list of strings, each of which is either "YES" or "NO". A developer may incorrectly output a single string, or they may incorrectly output the wrong string for a given angle.
4. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem, such as:
    * Using incorrect data types for the input or output
    * Using incorrect algorithms to compute the possible angles that Raju can draw or to check whether a given angle is one of the possible angles
    * Using incorrect error handling
    * Not handling invalid input correctly

Title:
HACKEREARTH difdif

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of the `substring()` method**

The `substring()` method in Python takes two arguments: the start index and the end index. The start index is inclusive, and the end index is exclusive. This means that the substring `"abc"` of the string `"abcde"` starts at index 0 and ends at index 2.

If you incorrectly use the `substring()` method, you may end up with an incorrect answer. For example, if you try to find the substring `"bc"` of the string `"abcde"`, you will get the substring `"bcd"` instead.

**2. Using the wrong data type**

The `substring()` method returns a string. If you try to store the return value of the `substring()` method in a variable of a different data type, you will get an error.

For example, if you try to store the return value of the `substring()` method in a variable of type `int`, you will get an error.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When you are counting the number of substrings in a string, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, if you are counting the number of substrings of length 3 in the string `"abc"`, you might forget to include the substring `"abc"` itself.

**4. Using an inefficient algorithm**

There are many different algorithms that you can use to count the number of substrings in a string. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. If you use an inefficient algorithm, your code will run slowly.

**5. Not handling corner cases**

When you are writing code to solve a problem, it is important to handle corner cases. For example, if you are asked to find the number of substrings in a string, you should handle the case where the string is empty.

**6. Using incorrect variable names**

When you are writing code, it is important to use descriptive variable names. This will make your code easier to read and understand. For example, if you are counting the number of substrings in a string, you should use a variable name like `num_substrings` instead of `n`.

**7. Not commenting your code**

When you are writing code, it is important to comment your code. This will make your code easier to read and understand for other developers. For example, if you are writing a function to count the number of substrings in a string, you should comment the function with a description of what the function does.

Title:
HACKEREARTH lets-begin

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the `prime()` function.** The `prime()` function in Python returns a boolean value indicating whether the given number is prime. However, the problem statement requires you to find the minimum number of single-digit prime numbers that sum to a given number. To do this, you need to use the `sum()` function to add the numbers returned by the `prime()` function.
2. **Using an incorrect loop condition.** The problem statement specifies that the input consists of a single line containing a single integer. However, you may have accidentally used a loop condition that iterates over multiple lines of input. This would cause your code to incorrectly count the number of single-digit prime numbers that sum to the given number.
3. **Using an incorrect data type.** The problem statement specifies that the input consists of a single integer. However, you may have accidentally used a data type that is not able to store integers larger than a certain value. This would cause your code to incorrectly count the number of single-digit prime numbers that sum to the given number.
4. **Incorrectly handling negative numbers.** The problem statement specifies that the input consists of a single integer that is non-negative. However, you may have accidentally handled negative numbers incorrectly. This would cause your code to incorrectly count the number of single-digit prime numbers that sum to the given number.
5. **Incorrectly handling non-integer numbers.** The problem statement specifies that the input consists of a single integer. However, you may have accidentally handled non-integer numbers incorrectly. This would cause your code to incorrectly count the number of single-digit prime numbers that sum to the given number.

Pain points:
1. **Inconsistent test cases:** The input may contain test cases that are inconsistent with the problem statement. For example, a test case may contain a Pokemon that eats a food item that it does not match. A developer should check for these inconsistencies and handle them appropriately.
2. **Incorrect output:** The developer's code may produce incorrect output for some of the test cases. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a logic error in the code, or a mistake in the implementation. A developer should thoroughly test their code to ensure that it produces the correct output for all of the test cases.
3. **Time complexity:** The developer's code should be efficient enough to run within the time limits specified by the problem statement. A developer should carefully consider the time complexity of their code and make sure that it is as efficient as possible.
4. **Memory usage:** The developer's code should not use too much memory. A developer should carefully monitor the memory usage of their code and make sure that it does not exceed the limits specified by the problem statement.
5. **Code readability:** The developer's code should be easy to read and understand. A developer should use clear and concise variable names, and make sure that the code is well-structured. This will make it easier for other developers to understand and maintain the code.

HACKEREARTH pink-and-blue

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable types:** The problem statement mentions that the input contains integers, but the code uses strings to store the input. This can lead to errors when comparing the input values.
2. **Incorrect data structures:** The problem statement mentions that there are two types of students: boys and girls. However, the code uses a single array to store all of the students. This can lead to errors when trying to determine the gender of a particular student.
3. **Incorrect logic:** The problem statement states that "Every student would get a T-Shirt that is of a different color than his/her friends." However, the code does not check whether the students are friends or not. This can lead to errors when distributing the T-shirts.
4. **Incorrect output:** The problem statement states that the output should be the minimum number of inversions required. However, the code simply prints the number of inversions. This can lead to confusion for the user.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to use the correct variable types and data structures. Finally, it is important to check for errors in the logic and ensure that the output is correct.

4. **The problem does not specify the time complexity or space complexity requirements.** The problem does not specify the time complexity or space complexity requirements. This could lead to developers implementing inefficient solutions.
5. **The problem does not provide test cases.** The problem does not provide test cases. This could make it difficult for developers to debug their solutions.

## Solutions to these problems

1. **The input format can be specified as follows:**

```
n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    r = int(input())
```

2. **The output format can be specified as follows:**

```
print(roy_amount)
```

3. **The problem can be solved by using the following algorithm:**

```
def get_min_prime_factor(n):
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
    return n

n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    r = int(input())
    roy_amount = r - get_min_prime_factor(r)
    print(roy_amount)
```

4. **The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(n log n)**. This is because the algorithm iterates over all the prime factors of `r`. The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1).
5. **The following test cases can be used to debug the solution:**

```

HACKEREARTH subset-sum-2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the subset sum algorithm.** The subset sum algorithm is a recursive algorithm that finds the sum of all possible subsets of a given set. A common mistake is to incorrectly implement the algorithm, which can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Using an incorrect data type for the subset sum.** The subset sum is a large number, so it is important to use an appropriate data type to store it. A common mistake is to use a data type that is too small, which can lead to overflow errors.
3. **Not handling negative numbers correctly.** The subset sum algorithm can be used to find the sum of all possible subsets of a set of positive or negative numbers. A common mistake is to not handle negative numbers correctly, which can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Not using memoization to speed up the algorithm.** The subset sum algorithm can be very slow for large sets. A common optimization is to use memoization to store the results of previously computed subproblems. This can significantly speed up the algorithm.
5. **Not using bitmasks to represent subsets.** The subset sum algorithm can be further optimized by using bitmasks to represent subsets. This can reduce the amount of memory required by the algorithm and also speed it up.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect calculation of the number of multiples.** The developer may incorrectly calculate the number of multiples by adding the number of multiples of d in each of the intervals [L, R), [L+1, R), ..., [R-1, R]. This will result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect handling of the case where L is divisible by d.** The developer may incorrectly assume that the number of multiples of d in the interval [L, R] is the same as the number of multiples of d in the interval [L+1, R]. This will result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect handling of the case where R is divisible by d.** The developer may incorrectly assume that the number of multiples of d in the interval [L, R] is the same as the number of multiples of d in the interval [L, R-1]. This will result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect handling of the case where L and R are both divisible by d.** The developer may incorrectly assume that the number of multiples of d in the interval [L, R] is 0. This will result in an incorrect answer.

ATCODER p02737 AtCoder Grand Contest 043 - Giant Graph

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm**

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that can be used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. However, if the graph is not represented in an adjacency matrix, the implementation of the algorithm can be incorrect.

For example, the following code is an incorrect implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for a graph with three vertices:

```
def floyd_warshall(graph):
  """
  Finds the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.

  Args:
    graph: A dictionary mapping vertices to lists of adjacent vertices.

  Returns:
    A dictionary mapping pairs of vertices to the length of the shortest path between them.
  """

  n = len(graph)
  dist = [[float('inf') for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
  for i in range(n):
    dist[i][i] = 0
  for u in range(n):
    for v in graph[u]:
      dist[u][v] = graph[u][v]

  for k in range(n):
    for i in range(n):
      for j in range(n):
        dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j])

  return dist

```

This implementation is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the shortest path between two vertices may not be unique. For example, in the graph below, the shortest path from vertex 0 to vertex 2 is either 0 -> 1 -> 2 or 0 -> 2. The implementation above will only find the first of these paths, which is incorrect.

```
0 -> 1 -> 2
|   / \   |
| /   / \  |
1 -> 2 -> 0
```

**2. Using an incorrect data structure to represent the graph**

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can be implemented using a variety of data structures to represent the graph. However, if the wrong data structure is used, the algorithm may not be able to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.

For example, the following code is an incorrect implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for a graph with three vertices. The graph is represented using a list of lists, where each list represents the adjacent vertices of a vertex.

```
def floyd_warshall(graph):
  """
  Finds the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.

  Args:
    graph: A list of lists representing the adjacent vertices of each vertex.

  Returns:
    A dictionary mapping pairs of vertices to the length of the shortest path between them.
  """

  n = len(graph)
  dist = [[float('inf') for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
  for i in range(n):
    dist[i][i] = 0
  for u in range(n):
    for v in graph[u]:
      dist[u][v] = graph[u][v]

  for k in range(n):
    for i in range(n):
      for j in range(n):
        dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j])

  return dist

```

This implementation is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the shortest path between two vertices may not be unique. For example, in the graph below, the shortest path from vertex 0 to vertex 2 is either 0 -> 1 -> 2 or 0 -> 2. The implementation above will only find the first of these paths, which is incorrect.

```
0 -> 1 -> 2
|   / \   |
| /   / \  |
1 -> 2 -> 0
```

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm to find the maximum independent set**

The maximum independent set problem is the problem of finding a set of vertices in a graph such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent. The maximum independent set problem is NP-hard, which means that there is no known polynomial-time algorithm to solve it.

However, there are a number of approximation algorithms that can be used to

ATCODER p03006 diverta 2019 Programming Contest 2 - Picking Up

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The problem states that `N` is an integer, but the following code will not work:

```
N = int(input())
```

This is because `input()` returns a string, and `int()` will throw an error if you try to convert a string to an integer. To fix this, you can use the `int()` function with the `str()` function to convert the string to an integer:

```
N = int(str(input()))
```

2. **Incorrect variable initialization**. The problem states that `x_i` and `y_i` are integers, but the following code will not work:

```
x_i = input()
y_i = input()
```

This is because `input()` returns a string, and `int()` will throw an error if you try to convert a string to an integer. To fix this, you can use the `int()` function to convert the string to an integer:

```
x_i = int(input())
y_i = int(input())
```

3. **Incorrect logic**. The problem states that we need to find the minimum total cost required to collect all the balls. The following code will not work:

```
total_cost = 0
for i in range(N):
    total_cost += abs(x_i - x_j) + abs(y_i - y_j)
print(total_cost)
```

This is because the code is only adding the cost of the first operation, not the cost of all the operations. To fix this, you need to add the cost of each operation to the total cost.

```
total_cost = 0
for i in range(N):
    total_cost += abs(x_i - x_j) + abs(y_i - y_j)
print(total_cost)

Title:
ATCODER p03146 AtCoder Beginner Contest 116 - Collatz Problem

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Collatz function.** The Collatz function is a recursive function that takes an integer as input and returns the next value in the Collatz sequence. A common mistake is to implement the function incorrectly, such as by using the modulo operator instead of the division operator. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Using an incorrect data structure to store the Collatz sequence.** The Collatz sequence can be very large, so it is important to use an efficient data structure to store it. A common mistake is to use a list or array to store the sequence, as this can quickly lead to memory issues. A better option is to use a hash table or a binary tree.
3. **Not handling boundary cases correctly.** The Collatz sequence has a number of boundary cases that need to be handled correctly. For example, the sequence starts with the number 1, which is neither even nor odd. A common mistake is to ignore these boundary cases, which can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Not using a timeout.** The Collatz sequence can be very large, so it is important to use a timeout to prevent the program from running for too long. A common mistake is to not use a timeout, which can lead to the program crashing or hanging.
5. **Not using a unit test framework.** Unit tests are an essential tool for debugging and ensuring the correctness of your code. A common mistake is to not use a unit test framework, which can make it difficult to find and fix bugs.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* A bug where the Collatz function returns the wrong value. This could happen if the function is implemented incorrectly, or if the data structure used to store the sequence is not efficient.
* A bug where the program runs out of memory. This could happen if the sequence is very large and is stored in a list or array.
* A bug where the program hangs or crashes. This could happen if the sequence is very large and the program does not have a timeout.
* A bug where the program does not produce the correct output. This could happen if the boundary cases are not handled correctly, or if the unit tests are not comprehensive.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect BMI calculation.** The BMI formula is:

```
BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m)) ^ 2
```

Some developers may accidentally calculate BMI as:

```
BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))
```

This will result in incorrect BMI values.

2. **Using the wrong data type for BMI.** BMI is a floating-point number, so it should be stored in a floating-point data type, such as `float` or `double`. Some developers may accidentally store BMI in an integer data type, such as `int` or `short`, which will result in incorrect BMI values.

3. **Using the wrong data type for height and weight.** Height and weight are both measured in meters and kilograms, respectively. So they should be stored in floating-point data types. Some developers may accidentally store height and weight in integer data types, which will result in incorrect BMI values.

4. **Not handling invalid input correctly.** The input may contain invalid data, such as negative values or non-numeric values. Developers should handle invalid input gracefully, such as by printing an error message and exiting the program.

5. **Not handling the end of input correctly.** The input may end with a zero. Developers should check for the end of input and handle it gracefully, such as by exiting the program.

Title:
AIZU p00815 Map of Ninja House

Pain points:
Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not well-defined, so it is possible for a developer to misinterpret the input and make mistakes. For example, the input could be a list of numbers, a list of strings, or a mix of both.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is also not well-defined, so it is possible for a developer to misinterpret the output and make mistakes. For example, the output could be a list of lists, a list of strings, or a mix of both.
* **Incorrect data structures:** The problem requires the developer to use data structures to represent the graph of the Ninja House. If the developer chooses the wrong data structures, it could lead to errors in the program.
* **Incorrect algorithms:** The problem requires the developer to use algorithms to find the shortest path between two rooms in the Ninja House. If the developer chooses the wrong algorithms, it could lead to errors in the program.
* **Incorrect implementation:** Even if the developer correctly interprets the input format, correctly defines the output format, correctly chooses the data structures, and correctly uses the algorithms, there is still a chance that the developer will make mistakes in the implementation of the program. This could lead to errors in the program.

To avoid these problems, it is important for the developer to carefully read and understand the problem statement. The developer should also carefully design the program and test it thoroughly before releasing it to the public.

Title:
AIZU p00946 Rearranging a Sequence

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is `n k`, where `n` is the number of elements in the sequence and `k` is the number of elements to be rearranged. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly process the input and may produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is the rearranged sequence of elements. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly output the results and may produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic used to rearrange the sequence of elements must be correct. If the logic is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly rearrange the sequence and may produce incorrect output.
4. **Memory leaks.** The program must be careful not to allocate memory that is not needed. If the program allocates memory that is not needed, it may eventually run out of memory and crash.
5. **Race conditions.** The program must be careful to avoid race conditions. A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. If a race condition occurs, the program may produce incorrect output or even crash.
6. **Deadlocks.** The program must be careful to avoid deadlocks. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are each waiting for the other to release a resource. If a deadlock occurs, the program will be unable to continue execution and may eventually crash.
7. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program must be careful not to introduce any security vulnerabilities. A security vulnerability is a weakness in the program that could be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.
8. **Performance issues.** The program must be efficient and perform well. If the program is too slow, it may not be usable in a production environment.
9. **Usability issues.** The program must be easy to use and understand. If the program is difficult to use or understand, users may not be able to use it effectively.
10. **Maintainability issues.** The program must be easy to maintain and update. If the program is difficult to maintain, it will be more difficult to fix bugs and add new features.

Title:
AIZU p01079 Hogemon Get

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrectly initializing the data structures.** The data structures used to store the graph and the balls collected in each town must be initialized correctly in order for the algorithm to work properly.
* **Using an incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm used to find the maximum number of balls that can be collected must be correct in order for the program to output the correct answer.
* **Incorrectly handling edge cases.** The program must be able to handle edge cases such as when the graph is not connected or when there is no path from town 1 to town N within the time limit.
* **Not handling errors correctly.** The program must be able to handle errors such as invalid input or when the program runs out of memory.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly initializing the graph.** If the graph is not initialized correctly, the algorithm will not be able to find the maximum number of balls that can be collected. For example, if the graph is initialized with a directed edge from town 1 to town 2, the algorithm will not be able to find the maximum number of balls that can be collected if the path from town 1 to town 2 goes through town 3.
* **Using an incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm used to find the maximum number of balls that can be collected must be correct in order for the program to output the correct answer. For example, a naive algorithm that simply iterates over all possible paths from town 1 to town N will not work correctly if there are multiple paths with the same length.
* **Incorrectly handling edge cases.** The program must be able to handle edge cases such as when the graph is not connected or when there is no path from town 1 to town N within the time limit. For example, if the graph is not connected, the program should output `-1` instead of trying to find the maximum number of balls that can be collected.
* **Not handling errors correctly.** The program must be able to handle errors such as invalid input or when the program runs out of memory. For example, if the user enters an invalid number of towns or roads, the program should output an error message and exit.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
AIZU p01213 Repeated Subsequences

Pain points:
**1. The input string may contain duplicate characters.** This could cause the longest repeated subsequence to be shorter than it should be. For example, if the input string is "AAABBBCCC", the longest repeated subsequence is "ABC", not "AAABBBC".

**2. The input string may not contain any repeated characters.** In this case, the longest repeated subsequence is the empty string.

**3. The input string may be very long.** This could make it difficult to find the longest repeated subsequence efficiently.

**4. The input string may contain non-alphabetic characters.** These characters should be ignored when finding the longest repeated subsequence.

**5. The input string may contain invalid characters.** These characters should be ignored when finding the longest repeated subsequence.

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input format is not very clear. It is not obvious what the meaning of $N$ and $Q$ are, or what the format of the requests is.
* The problem statement does not specify how to handle ties. For example, if two requests have the same start and end points, but different numbers of products, it is not clear which one should be processed first.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if there are not enough plates on the conveyor belt to satisfy all of the requests.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if a request cannot be completed because there is no path from the start point to the end point.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if a request cannot be completed because there are not enough products available.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if a request cannot be completed because the conveyor belt is moving too fast.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if a request cannot be completed because the conveyor belt is moving too slow.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if a request cannot be completed because the conveyor belt is not moving at all.

Title:
AIZU p02113 Palindrome

Pain points:
### Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly defining the input format.** The input format for this problem is not straightforward, and it is easy to make mistakes when defining it. For example, you might forget to include the newline character at the end of each line of input, or you might not specify the correct number of columns.
* **Misunderstanding the problem statement.** The problem statement for this problem is somewhat complex, and it is easy to make mistakes when interpreting it. For example, you might think that you need to find all possible palindromes that can be made from the given strings, when in reality you only need to find the longest one.
* **Using an inefficient algorithm.** The naive algorithm for finding the longest palindrome that can be made from a set of strings is to simply iterate over all possible combinations of strings and check if each combination is a palindrome. This algorithm is very inefficient, and it will quickly become impractical for large sets of strings.
* **Not handling special cases correctly.** The input for this problem may contain special cases, such as empty strings or strings that only contain a single character. It is important to handle these special cases correctly, or your solution will not be correct.

### Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* **Be careful when defining the input format.** Make sure to include all of the required fields, and make sure to use the correct delimiters.
* **Read the problem statement carefully and make sure you understand it.** If you are not sure what the problem is asking you to do, ask for clarification.
* **Use an efficient algorithm.** There are a number of efficient algorithms for finding the longest palindrome that can be made from a set of strings. Do some research to find an algorithm that is appropriate for your problem.
* **Handle special cases correctly.** Make sure to test your solution on a variety of input data, including empty strings and strings that only contain a single character.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem.

Title:
AIZU p02253 Activity Selection Problem

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect sorting**. The activities should be sorted by their finish time in ascending order. If they are not sorted correctly, the algorithm will not find the maximum number of activities that can be performed.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm**. The greedy algorithm works by iteratively choosing the activity with the earliest finish time that does not conflict with any of the previously selected activities. If the algorithm is not implemented correctly, it may not find the maximum number of activities that can be performed.
3. **Incorrect handling of ties**. If there are two or more activities with the same finish time, the greedy algorithm should choose the activity with the earlier start time. If the algorithm does not handle ties correctly, it may not find the maximum number of activities that can be performed.
4. **Incorrect output**. The output should be the maximum number of activities that can be performed. If the output is incorrect, the algorithm will not be correct.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. Make sure that the activities are sorted by their finish time in ascending order. You can use the `sort()` function in Python or the `qsort()` function in C++ to sort the activities.
2. Make sure that the greedy algorithm is implemented correctly. The greedy algorithm should work by iteratively choosing the activity with the earliest finish time that does not conflict with any of the previously selected activities.
3. Make sure that ties are handled correctly. If there are two or more activities with the same finish time, the greedy algorithm should choose the activity with the earlier start time.
4. Make sure that the output is correct. The output should be the maximum number of activities that can be performed.

Title:
AIZU p02401 Simple Calculator

Pain points:
1
1. **Incorrect operator**. The operator must be one of '+', '-', '*', or '/'. If the operator is incorrect, the program should print an error message.
2. **Division by zero**. The program should not divide by zero. If the denominator is zero, the program should print an error message.
3. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be in the format `a op b`. If the input format is incorrect, the program should print an error message.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. When performing arithmetic operations, it is important to be careful about off-by-one errors. For example, when adding two numbers, it is important to make sure that the sum does not overflow.
5. **Memory errors**. The program should be careful not to allocate too much memory. If the program allocates too much memory, it may crash.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program should be careful not to introduce any security vulnerabilities. For example, the program should not allow users to input arbitrary code.
