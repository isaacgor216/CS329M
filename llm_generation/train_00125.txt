Title:
CODECHEF devhand

Pain points:
Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect implementation of the constraints.** The constraints for this problem are not very well-defined. For example, it is not clear what is meant by "alphabet size of characters in the string is equal to first K English Alphabets". Does this mean that the string can only contain characters from the first K letters of the alphabet? Or does it mean that the string can contain any character from the alphabet, but it must contain at least K characters? It is also not clear what is meant by "Devu will not attach strings such that one of the string on a watch is prefix (not necessarily proper prefix) of some other string on other watch". Does this mean that the strings cannot be equal to each other? Or does it mean that the strings cannot be a substring of each other?
* **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator is often used to ensure that the output of a calculation is within a certain range. However, it is important to remember that the modulo operator does not always work the way you expect it to. For example, if you calculate `10 % 3`, you would expect the answer to be 1. However, the modulo operator actually returns the remainder of the division, which in this case is 1. This means that the answer to `10 % 3` is actually 1, not 0.
* **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement does not explicitly mention any edge cases. However, there are a few edge cases that you should be aware of when solving this problem. For example, what happens if `N` is 0? Or what happens if `K` is 0? It is important to handle these edge cases correctly in order to ensure that your code is correct.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems and bugs:

* **Read the problem statement carefully and make sure you understand all of the constraints.** This is the most important step in avoiding problems and bugs. If you do not understand the problem statement, you will not be able to write correct code.
* **Test your code thoroughly.** Once you have written your code, you should test it thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. This means testing your code with different inputs and checking that the output is correct.
* **Use the modulo operator correctly.** The modulo operator can be tricky to use correctly. Make sure you understand how it works and that you are using it correctly in your code.
* **Handle edge cases correctly.** There are often edge cases that you need to handle when solving a problem. Make sure you are aware of these edge cases and that you are handling them correctly in your code.

Title:
CODECHEF iitk2p10

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulo operator**. The modulo operator (%) should be used to calculate the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 = 1. However, some developers may accidentally use the division operator (/) instead, which would result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect factorial calculation**. The factorial of a number n is the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120. However, some developers may accidentally calculate the factorial of a negative number, which would result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect array indexing**. When accessing an element of an array, the index must be within the bounds of the array. For example, if an array has 10 elements, the index of the last element is 9. However, some developers may accidentally access an element outside of the bounds of the array, which would result in an error.
4. **Incorrect use of recursion**. Recursion is a powerful programming technique, but it can be easy to make mistakes when using it. For example, a developer may forget to add a base case to their recursive function, which would cause the function to enter an infinite loop.
5. **Incorrect use of dynamic programming**. Dynamic programming is a technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems. This can be a very efficient way to solve problems, but it is important to use dynamic programming correctly. For example, a developer may accidentally use the same subproblem multiple times, which would result in an incorrect answer.

Title:
CODECHEF xorsub

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of XOR operator.** The XOR operator is a binary operator that returns a 1 if the two operands are different and a 0 if they are the same. In the problem statement, the XOR operator is used to combine the elements of an array into a single value. However, this is not possible because the XOR operator only works on two operands. To solve this problem, you can use the `reduce` function to combine the elements of the array into a single value.
2. **Incorrect use of the `max` function.** The `max` function returns the largest value in a list. In the problem statement, the `max` function is used to find the maximum value of the XOR of all possible subsets of the array. However, this is not possible because the `max` function only works on a single value. To solve this problem, you can use the `reduce` function to find the maximum value of the XOR of all possible subsets of the array.
3. **Incorrect use of the `enumerate` function.** The `enumerate` function returns a tuple of two elements for each element in a list. The first element of the tuple is the index of the element in the list, and the second element is the value of the element. In the problem statement, the `enumerate` function is used to iterate over the elements of the array. However, this is not necessary because the `reduce` function can iterate over the elements of the array without using the `enumerate` function.
4. **Incorrect use of the `if` statement.** The `if` statement is used to check a condition and execute a block of code if the condition is true. In the problem statement, the `if` statement is used to check if the value of the XOR of all possible subsets of the array is greater than the value of K. However, this is not possible because the `if` statement only works on a single value. To solve this problem, you can use the `max` function to find the maximum value of the XOR of all possible subsets of the array and then check if that value is greater than the value of K.
5. **Incorrect use of the `return` statement.** The `return` statement is used to exit a function and return a value. In the problem statement, the `return` statement is used to return the value of the XOR of all possible subsets of the array. However, this is not necessary because the `reduce` function already returns a value. To solve this problem, you can remove the `return` statement from the problem statement.

CODEFORCES 1023_F. Mobile Phone Network

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of nodes is not a positive integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values must be correctly specified, or the program will not be able to process them correctly. For example, if the number of nodes is specified as a string, the program will not be able to convert it to an integer and will crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that occurs when the programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to incorrect results or even a crash. For example, if the program is supposed to iterate over a list of numbers, but the programmer forgets to increment the index variable by one, the program will skip the last element of the list.
4. **Logic errors**. Logic errors occur when the programmer makes a mistake in the logic of the program. This can lead to incorrect results or even a crash. For example, if the program is supposed to find the maximum value in a list, but the programmer uses the wrong algorithm, the program will return the wrong value.
5. **Memory errors**. Memory errors occur when the program allocates too much or too little memory. This can lead to the program crashing or running slowly. For example, if the program allocates a large amount of memory for a temporary variable that is only used for a short period of time, the program will run slowly.
6. **Synchronization errors**. Synchronization errors occur when multiple threads in a program try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even a crash. For example, if two threads are trying to update the same variable at the same time, the program will not know which thread's update to use, and the variable will be incorrect.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities occur when the program allows attackers to access sensitive data or take control of the program. For example, if the program does not properly validate user input, attackers can inject malicious code into the program and take control of it.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1045_A. Last chance

Pain points:
### Possible problems and bugs

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if the input contains a space between two numbers, the program may interpret them as two separate numbers.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong type. For example, if the number of spaceships is a string, the program may not be able to process it correctly.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program may contain logical errors, such as a missing condition or an incorrect calculation. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are common in programming, and they can be difficult to find. For example, if the program is supposed to print the first 10 numbers in a list, but it prints the first 9 numbers instead, this is an off-by-one error.
5. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more parts of a program access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
7. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more parts of a program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish because it is waiting for the other. This can lead to the program running indefinitely or crashing.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can occur when a program is not properly protected from malicious attacks. This can allow attackers to gain access to the program and steal data or damage the system.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully test the program and to use a programming language that is designed to prevent these types of errors.

**Possible Problems and Bugs:**

* **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** This is the most common mistake that programmers make when solving a problem. Make sure that you understand the problem statement clearly before you start coding.
* **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** This can happen if you make a mistake in your code or if you use an incorrect algorithm. Make sure to test your code thoroughly before submitting it.
* **Runtime errors.** These can happen if your code runs out of memory or if it takes too long to run. Make sure to optimize your code to avoid these errors.
* **Incorrect output.** This can happen if your code does not produce the correct output. Make sure to check your output carefully before submitting it.

Here are some specific problems and bugs that you may encounter when solving this problem:

* **You may not know how to find the number of vertices in the graph.** The number of vertices in the graph is equal to `t + c`.
* **You may not know how to find the edges in the graph.** The edges in the graph are given in the input as a list of pairs of vertices.
* **You may not know how to find the shortest path between two vertices in the graph.** The shortest path between two vertices in the graph can be found using Dijkstra's algorithm.
* **You may not know how to move the pieces of the friends along the edges of the graph.** The pieces of the friends can be moved along the edges of the graph by using the `next` command.
* **You may not know how to check if all the pieces of the friends are at the finish vertex.** All the pieces of the friends are at the finish vertex if the output of the `next` command is `1 0123456789`.

CODEFORCES 1157_A. Reachable Numbers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of f(x)**. The function f(x) should be applied to x until there are no trailing zeros. For example, f(599) should be 6, not 5.
2. **Incorrect use of the loop condition**. The loop should continue as long as there are trailing zeros in the number. For example, the loop should continue for n = 10099, because f(10099) = 101, which has a trailing zero.
3. **Incorrect use of the counter**. The counter should be incremented every time the loop body is executed. For example, the counter should be incremented for n = 10099, because f(10099) = 101, which is a different number from n.
4. **Incorrect handling of the base case**. The base case should handle the case where n is 0 or 1. For example, the base case should print 1 for n = 0 and 2 for n = 1.

CODEFORCES 1197_D. Yet Another Subarray Problem

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the sliding window.** The sliding window is a common data structure used to solve problems on subarrays. However, it is important to implement the sliding window correctly, otherwise the solution may be incorrect. For example, the following code would incorrectly compute the maximum sum of a subarray of size 3:

```
def max_subarray_sum(nums, k):
    # Initialize the sliding window.
    window = [0] * k

    # Iterate over the input array.
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        # Update the sliding window.
        window[i % k] += nums[i]

        # Find the maximum sum of the sliding window.
        max_sum = max(window)

    return max_sum
```

The problem with this code is that it does not correctly handle the case where the input array is shorter than the sliding window size. In this case, the sliding window will wrap around and start overwriting the previous values. This will cause the maximum sum of the sliding window to be incorrect.

To fix this problem, we can use a different implementation of the sliding window that keeps track of the maximum sum seen so far. This can be done using a separate variable, as shown below:

```
def max_subarray_sum(nums, k):
    # Initialize the maximum sum seen so far.
    max_sum = float('-inf')

    # Initialize the sliding window.
    window = [0] * k

    # Iterate over the input array.
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        # Update the sliding window.
        window[i % k] += nums[i]

        # Update the maximum sum seen so far.
        max_sum = max(max_sum, window[i % k])

    return max_sum
```

2. **Incorrect calculation of the cost of a subarray.** The cost of a subarray is equal to the sum of the elements in the subarray minus k times the number of subarrays. This can be calculated as follows:

```
cost = sum(a[i] for i in range(l, r + 1)) - k * ceil((r - l + 1) / m)
```

However, it is important to be careful when calculating the number of subarrays. The number of subarrays is not simply the number of elements in the subarray divided by the size of the sliding window. This is because the sliding window can overlap with itself. For example, if the sliding window size is 3 and the subarray is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], then there are 5 subarrays: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4], and [2, 3, 4, 5].

To correctly calculate the number of subarrays, we can use the following formula:

```
num_subarrays = ceil((r - l + 1) / m) - (r - l) // m
```

3. **Incorrect use of the ceil function.** The ceil function returns the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to a given number. This can be useful for calculating the number of subarrays, as shown in the previous section. However, it is important to be careful when using the ceil function, as it can sometimes return incorrect results. For example, the following code would incorrectly calculate the number of subarrays of size 3 in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:

```
num_subarrays = ceil((len(nums) - 1) / 3)
```

This is because the ceil function rounds up to the nearest integer, which in this case is 4. However, there are only 3 subarrays of size 3 in the array, not 4.

To correctly calculate the number of subarrays, we can use the following formula:

```
num_subarrays = ceil((r - l + 1) / m) - (r - l) // m
```

This formula takes into account the fact that the sliding window can overlap with itself.

CODEFORCES 1214_E. Petya and Construction Set

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format is not correctly followed, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.

### 2. Incorrect data type

The data type of the input may not be correctly specified, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program may crash.

### 3. Off-by-one errors

Off-by-one errors occur when the programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the programmer is counting the number of elements in an array, they may forget to increment the counter by one after adding an element to the array. This would result in the programmer counting one fewer element than there actually is in the array.

### 4. Logic errors

Logic errors occur when the programmer makes a mistake in the logic of the program. This can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the programmer is trying to find the maximum value in an array, they may accidentally compare the first element to the second element instead of the last element. This would result in the programmer finding the wrong maximum value.

### 5. Undefined behavior

Undefined behavior occurs when the compiler cannot determine what the program will do. This can happen when the programmer uses a feature of the programming language that is not well-defined. For example, if the programmer uses a pointer to an uninitialized variable, the compiler cannot determine what the value of the pointer will be. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.

### 6. Memory leaks

Memory leaks occur when the programmer allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

### 7. Race conditions

Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.

### 8. Deadlocks

Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can lead to the program being stuck and unable to continue.

### 9. Security vulnerabilities

Security vulnerabilities occur when the programmer makes a mistake that allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the program. This can lead to the attacker being able to steal data, damage the program, or take control of the computer.

CODEFORCES 1237_G. Balanced Distribution

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the parsing of the input data. For example, if the input contains a space between two integers, this may be interpreted as two separate integers instead of one.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the interpretation of the output data. For example, if the output contains a newline character between two integers, this may be interpreted as two separate integers instead of one.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of meetings.** The number of meetings required to achieve a perfectly balanced distribution of stones may be incorrect. This may be due to a number of factors, such as the starting distribution of stones or the size of the meetings.
4. **Incorrect redistribution of stones during meetings.** The stones may not be redistributed evenly among the participants in a meeting. This may be due to a number of factors, such as the starting distribution of stones or the size of the meetings.
5. **Incorrect final distribution of stones.** The final distribution of stones may not be perfectly balanced. This may be due to a number of factors, such as the starting distribution of stones or the number of meetings.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement and input format. It is also important to carefully check the output format and to make sure that the number of meetings and the final distribution of stones are correct.

CODEFORCES 1405_C. Balanced Bitstring

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrectly counting the number of 0s and 1s in the string.** This is a common mistake that can be made when solving this problem. It is important to remember that the number of 0s and 1s in the string must be equal for every substring of size k. To avoid this mistake, you can use a hash map to track the number of 0s and 1s in the string.
* **Not considering the case where there are no ? characters in the string.** If there are no ? characters in the string, then the string is already k-balanced. This is a common mistake that can be made when solving this problem. To avoid this mistake, you can check if the string contains any ? characters before continuing with the rest of the solution.
* **Incorrectly handling the case where the number of 0s and 1s in the string is not equal.** If the number of 0s and 1s in the string is not equal, then it is not possible to make the string k-balanced by replacing the ? characters with either 0 or 1. This is a common mistake that can be made when solving this problem. To avoid this mistake, you can check if the number of 0s and 1s in the string is equal before continuing with the rest of the solution.
* **Incorrectly handling the case where the number of 0s and 1s in the string is equal but not divisible by k.** If the number of 0s and 1s in the string is equal but not divisible by k, then it is not possible to make the string k-balanced by replacing the ? characters with either 0 or 1. This is a common mistake that can be made when solving this problem. To avoid this mistake, you can check if the number of 0s and 1s in the string is divisible by k before continuing with the rest of the solution.

CODEFORCES 1426_E. Rock, Paper, Scissors

Pain points:
**1. Input Format**

The first line of the input contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{9}) — the number of rounds.

The second line of the input contains three integers a_1, a_2, a_3 (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) — the number of times Alice will show rock, scissors and paper, respectively. It is guaranteed that a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = n.

The third line of the input contains three integers b_1, b_2, b_3 (0 ≤ b_j ≤ n) — the number of times Bob will show rock, scissors and paper, respectively. It is guaranteed that b_1 + b_2 + b_3 = n.

**2. Output Format**

Print two integers: the minimum and the maximum number of rounds Alice can win.

**3. Examples**

**Example 1**

```
Input

2
0 1 1
1 1 0

Output

0 1
```

**Explanation**

In the first example, Alice will not win any rounds if she shows scissors and then paper and Bob shows rock and then scissors. In the best outcome, Alice will win one round if she shows paper and then scissors, and Bob shows rock and then scissors.

**Example 2**

```
Input

15
5 5 5
5 5 5

Output

0 15
```

**Explanation**

In the second example, Alice will not win any rounds if Bob shows the same things as Alice each round.

**Example 3**

```
Input

3
0 0 3
3 0 0

Output

3 3
```

**Explanation**

In the third example, Alice always shows paper and Bob always shows rock so Alice will win all three rounds anyway.

**4. Possible Bugs**

1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input and output formats are specified in the problem statement, so it is important to make sure that you are using the correct data types for your variables. For example, if the input is a list of integers, you should use a list of integers for your variables, not a list of strings.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. When you are counting the number of rounds that Alice can win, it is important to make sure that you are not counting the rounds that Alice and Bob tie. For example, if Alice shows rock and Bob shows scissors, then they tie and neither of them wins a round.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic that you use to determine the minimum and maximum number of rounds that Alice can win must be correct. For example, if Alice shows rock and Bob shows paper, then Alice wins the round.
4. **Uninitialized variables**. It is important to initialize your variables before you use them. For example, if you declare a variable without initializing it, then the value of the variable will be undefined and you may get unexpected results.
5. **Incorrect use of functions**. If you are using a function that you do not understand, then you are more likely to make a mistake. It is important to read the documentation for the function carefully and make sure that you are using it correctly.
6. **Incorrect use of data structures**. If you are using a data structure that you do not understand, then you are more likely to make a mistake. It is important to read the documentation for the data structure carefully and make sure that you are using it correctly.
7. **Memory leaks**. If you are not careful, then you can create memory leaks in your code. A memory leak occurs when you allocate memory for a variable and then you do not free the memory when you are finished with it. This can cause your program to run out of memory and crash.
8. **Race conditions**. A race condition occurs when two or more threads are trying to access the same data at the same time. This can cause your program to produce incorrect results or to crash.
9. **Deadlocks**. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can cause your program to hang indefinitely.
10. **Buffer overflows**. A buffer overflow occurs when you write more data to a buffer than it can hold. This can cause your program to crash or to execute arbitrary code.

**5. How to avoid these bugs**

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is not very strict, so it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
* **Incorrect adjacency list representation.** The adjacency list representation of a graph is a common data structure used to represent graphs. However, it is important to make sure that the adjacency list is correctly represented, otherwise the program will not be able to find all of the shortest paths from the capital to each city.
* **Incorrect distance calculation.** The distance from a city to the capital is the sum of the weights of the edges on the shortest path from the city to the capital. It is important to make sure that you correctly calculate the distance from each city to the capital, otherwise the program will not be able to find all of the cities that are at distance l from the capital.
* **Incorrect output.** The output for this problem is the number of cities that are at distance l from the capital. It is important to make sure that you correctly print the output, otherwise the program will not be able to pass the test cases.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1499_F. Diameter Cuts

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** This is the most common bug that developers make when solving problems. It is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output format. In this problem, the developer needs to count the number of valid sets of edges modulo 998 244 353. A valid set of edges is a set of edges such that all the resulting trees have diameter less than or equal to k. The developer can implement the following algorithm:

```
def count_valid_sets(n, k, edges):
  # Initialize the number of valid sets to 0.
  num_valid_sets = 0

  # Iterate over all possible sets of edges.
  for i in range(2 ** (n - 1)):
    # Create a set of edges from the bitmask.
    edges_set = set()
    for j in range(n - 1):
      if (i >> j) & 1:
        edges_set.add(edges[j])

    # Check if the set of edges is valid.
    if is_valid_set(edges_set, k):
      # Increment the number of valid sets.
      num_valid_sets += 1

  # Return the number of valid sets.
  return num_valid_sets

def is_valid_set(edges_set, k):
  # Iterate over all pairs of vertices.
  for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
      # Check if there is a path between the two vertices that does not use any edges in the set.
      if not has_path(i, j, edges_set):
        return False

  # All pairs of vertices have a path that does not use any edges in the set.
  return True
```

This algorithm is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the diameter of a tree is the maximum length of a simple path between all pairs of vertices. In this problem, the developer needs to consider all possible paths between all pairs of vertices, not just the shortest paths.

2. **Incorrect use of data structures.** Another common bug that developers make when solving problems is incorrect use of data structures. In this problem, the developer needs to use a data structure to store the edges of the tree. The developer can use a list to store the edges of the tree. However, the developer needs to be careful not to create duplicate edges in the list.

```
edges = []
for i in range(n - 1):
  edges.append((edges[i][0], edges[i][1]))
```

This code will create duplicate edges in the list. The correct way to add an edge to the list is to check if the edge already exists in the list. If the edge does not exist in the list, then it can be added to the list.

```
edges = []
for i in range(n - 1):
  if not ((edges[i][0], edges[i][1]) in edges):
    edges.append((edges[i][0], edges[i][1]))
```

3. **Incorrect use of mathematical functions.** Another common bug that developers make when solving problems is incorrect use of mathematical functions. In this problem, the developer needs to use the modulo operator to calculate the number of valid sets of edges. The modulo operator is used to find the remainder of a division. In this problem, the developer needs to find the remainder of the number of valid sets of edges divided by 998 244 353.

```
num_valid_sets = count_valid_sets(n, k, edges)
print(num_valid_sets % 998244353)
```

This code will print the number of valid sets of edges modulo 998 244 353.

4. **Incorrect input format.** Another common bug that developers make when solving problems is incorrect input format. In this problem, the developer needs to read the input from the standard input. The input format is as follows:

```
n k
e1 e2
e3 e4
...
en-1 en
```

where `n` is the number of vertices of the tree, `k` is the maximum allowed diameter, and `e1`, `e2`, ..., `en-1`, `en` are the edges of the tree. The developer needs to make sure that the input is in the correct format.

Pain points:
 1. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The developer may make a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm, which will lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may forget to check the validity of the input data, or may use an incorrect formula to calculate the number of excellent arrays.
2. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The developer may use an incorrect data structure to store the data, which will lead to inefficient execution of the algorithm. For example, the developer may use a linked list to store the data, when an array would be a more efficient choice.
3. **Incorrect handling of errors.** The developer may not handle errors correctly, which could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results. For example, the developer may not check for errors when reading input data, or may not handle exceptions correctly.
4. **Incorrect testing.** The developer may not test the program thoroughly, which could lead to bugs that are not caught until the program is deployed in production. For example, the developer may not test the program with invalid input data, or may not test the program with different input data sets.
5. **Incorrect documentation.** The developer may not provide adequate documentation for the program, which could make it difficult for other developers to understand how the program works. For example, the developer may not provide a detailed description of the algorithm, or may not provide any examples of how to use the program.

CODEFORCES 177_A2. Good Matrix Elements

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line of input data should contain a single odd integer n. However, a developer may accidentally enter an even integer or a non-integer value. This will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the sum of good matrix elements.** The sum of good matrix elements is equal to the sum of the elements of the main diagonal, the secondary diagonal, the "middle" row, and the "middle" column. However, a developer may accidentally calculate the sum of all matrix elements or only some of the good matrix elements. This will result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect output.** The output should be a single integer - the sum of good matrix elements. However, a developer may accidentally output multiple integers, a non-integer value, or nothing at all. This will cause the program to receive a zero score.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully check the input format and the calculation of the sum of good matrix elements. They should also carefully format the output to ensure that it is a single integer.

For example, make sure that you are providing two space-separated integers for the dimensions of the maze, and that you are using the correct characters to represent walls, passable cells, and the starting point.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over the maze, it is easy to make a mistake and miss a cell or count a cell twice. Be careful to check your indices carefully and make sure that you are not missing any cells.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic for determining whether the little boy can walk infinitely far is not always straightforward. Make sure that you are thinking carefully about the problem and that you are using the correct algorithm.
4. **Incorrect output.** The output for this problem should be a single word, either "Yes" or "No". Make sure that you are not printing any extra characters or spaces.
5. **Runtime errors.** This problem can be solved in O(n * m) time, so if your code is running much slower than that, you may have a bug. Make sure that you are using efficient algorithms and data structures.
6. **Memory errors.** This problem does not require a lot of memory, so if your code is running out of memory, you may have a bug. Make sure that you are not allocating unnecessary memory or storing large data structures.

Title:
CODEFORCES 220_E. Little Elephant and Inversions

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains two integers n and k, which are both positive. However, the problem statement states that k can be up to 10^18. This means that we need to use a 64-bit integer to store k. If we use a 32-bit integer, we will get an overflow error.

**2. Not handling the case where k is 0**

The problem statement states that the Little Elephant wants to count the number of pairs of integers l and r such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n and sequence b = a1a2... alarar + 1... an has no more than k inversions. However, if k is 0, then there are no inversions in sequence b, and the answer is simply n*(n-1)/2.

**3. Not handling the case where n is 1**

The problem statement states that the Little Elephant has an array a, consisting of n positive integers. However, if n is 1, then the array a is empty, and there are no pairs of integers l and r such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. In this case, the answer is 0.

**4. Not handling the case where k is greater than the number of inversions**

The problem statement states that the Little Elephant wants to count the number of pairs of integers l and r such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n and sequence b = a1a2... alarar + 1... an has no more than k inversions. However, if k is greater than the number of inversions in sequence b, then the answer is simply n*(n-1)/2.

**5. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The most efficient algorithm for counting the number of inversions in a sequence is merge sort. However, the problem statement does not specify that we must use merge sort. We could use a slower algorithm, such as bubble sort, and still get the correct answer.

CODEFORCES 26_D. Tickets

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect variable type**

The input consists of three integers, but the code below assumes that they are strings. This will cause a `TypeError`.

```python
n, m, k = input().split()
```

To fix this, we can use the `int()` function to convert the strings to integers.

```python
n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
```

**2. Incorrect calculation**

The code below calculates the probability of Charlie having change for every person with a 20 euro banknote as follows:

```python
probability = (n + k) / (n + m)
```

This is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that Charlie may not have enough change for everyone with a 20 euro banknote. To fix this, we need to add a condition to the `if` statement.

```python
if k >= m:
    probability = 1
else:
    probability = (n + k) / (n + m)
```

**3. Rounding error**

The code below rounds the probability to 4 digits after the decimal point. However, this may not be accurate enough for some problems. To fix this, we can use the `round()` function with a higher number of digits.

```python
print(round(probability, 4))

CODEFORCES 316_G2. Good Substrings

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

1. **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not as expected, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input string contains a number, the program may try to interpret it as an integer and fail.
2. **Incorrect data type:** The program may be expecting a certain data type for the input, but the input is of a different type. For example, if the program is expecting an integer but the input is a string, the program may crash.
3. **Incorrect logic:** The program may contain errors in its logic, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program is supposed to find the maximum value in an array, but it uses the wrong formula, the result will be incorrect.
4. **Off-by-one errors:** The program may make off-by-one errors, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program is supposed to find the index of the first occurrence of a character in a string, but it starts searching at the wrong index, the result will be incorrect.
5. **Memory leaks:** The program may not release memory that it has allocated, which can lead to a memory leak. A memory leak can eventually cause the program to crash.
6. **Race conditions:** The program may not be thread-safe, which can lead to race conditions. A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time, which can lead to incorrect results or even a program crash.
7. **Deadlocks:** The program may deadlock, which occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, which can prevent any of the threads from continuing execution.
8. **Unhandled exceptions:** The program may not handle exceptions correctly, which can lead to the program crashing. For example, if the program tries to divide by zero, it should throw an exception, but if the program does not handle the exception, it will crash.
9. **Security vulnerabilities:** The program may contain security vulnerabilities, which can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or the system. For example, if the program accepts user input without validating it, an attacker could send malicious input that could be used to exploit a security vulnerability.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design and test your program. You should also use a debugger to help you find and fix errors.

1. **Incorrect implementation of the bubble sort algorithm.** The most common mistake is to forget to swap the elements if they are not in the correct order. Another common mistake is to not check if the array is already sorted before starting the algorithm.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the graph data structure.** The graph should be represented as an adjacency list or adjacency matrix. It is important to make sure that the graph is correctly initialized and that edges are added and removed correctly.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the maximum independent set algorithm.** The maximum independent set algorithm should find all of the vertices in the graph that are not connected to any other vertices. It is important to make sure that the algorithm is correct and that it runs in polynomial time.
4. **Incorrect input or output format.** The input and output format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that the input is correctly formatted and that the output is formatted correctly.
5. **Runtime errors.** The bubble sort algorithm and the maximum independent set algorithm can both be implemented in a way that runs in O(n^2) time. It is important to make sure that the algorithms are implemented efficiently so that they run in a reasonable amount of time.

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a string of decimal digits, but the developer may accidentally use an integer data type to store it. This will cause the program to crash when it tries to perform arithmetic operations on the string.

**2. Using the wrong formula**

The formula for calculating the sum of bij for all cells in a rectangle is bij = si·sj. The developer may accidentally use the formula bij = si + sj, which will give incorrect results.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming algorithm. The developer may accidentally use a brute-force algorithm, which will be much slower.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement specifies that the input data is a string of decimal digits, and that the output should be a single integer. The developer may accidentally forget to check for these conditions, which will cause the program to crash.

**5. Using incorrect variable names**

The problem statement uses the following variable names: a, s, bij, x, y, z, t. The developer may accidentally use different variable names, which will make the code difficult to read and understand.

**6. Not commenting the code**

The developer should comment the code to explain what it does. This will make it easier for other developers to understand the code and debug it if necessary.

CODEFORCES 408_C. Triangle

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the input and output.** The input and output of this problem are integers, so the developer should use the `int` data type to store them. Using the wrong data type could lead to incorrect results.
2. **Not checking for invalid input.** The input of this problem is two integers, but the developer should check to make sure that they are both positive and less than 1000. If the input is invalid, the developer should print an error message and exit the program.
3. **Not using the right algorithm.** The correct algorithm for solving this problem is to first find the hypotenuse of the triangle, which is equal to `sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`. Then, the developer can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the coordinates of the triangle's vertices.
4. **Making a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm.** The developer should carefully check their code to make sure that there are no mistakes in the implementation of the algorithm. A mistake in the implementation could lead to incorrect results.
5. **Not handling edge cases.** The developer should handle edge cases such as when the triangle is a right triangle with sides of length 1 and 1, or when the triangle is a degenerate triangle with sides of length 0.

By following these tips, the developer can avoid common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 435_D. Special Grid

Pain points:
### Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrectly counting the number of triangles.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. They often forget to account for the fact that each triangle can be counted multiple times, depending on how it is oriented. For example, the triangle in the following figure can be counted as either a horizontal triangle or a diagonal triangle:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/952584r.png" width="250px">

To avoid this mistake, it is important to keep track of the orientation of each triangle as you are counting them.

2. **Incorrectly checking if a triangle is valid.** A triangle is valid if it has a positive area, all of its sides are grid lines, and none of its sides contain black nodes. Developers often make mistakes when checking these conditions. For example, they may forget to check if the triangle has a positive area or if its sides are grid lines.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to carefully check each condition before you count the triangle.

3. **Incorrectly implementing the algorithm.** The algorithm for counting the number of triangles is relatively straightforward, but it is easy to make mistakes when implementing it. For example, developers may forget to initialize variables correctly or they may make mistakes in the logic of the algorithm.

Title:
CODEFORCES 528_B. Clique Problem

Pain points:
### Possible problems and bugs

1. **Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm.** The greedy algorithm for finding the maximum clique in a graph works by repeatedly adding the vertex that has the most edges to the current clique until no more vertices can be added. However, if the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect, it is possible that the algorithm will not find the maximum clique. For example, the algorithm could miss a vertex that would have been included in the maximum clique if it had been added earlier.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the sorting algorithm.** The sorting algorithm used to sort the vertices by their weights must be correct in order for the greedy algorithm to work correctly. If the sorting algorithm is incorrect, it is possible that the vertices will not be sorted in the correct order, which could lead to the algorithm finding a suboptimal clique.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the distance calculation.** The distance between two vertices in a graph is the absolute value of the difference between their coordinates. However, if the implementation of the distance calculation is incorrect, it is possible that the distances between the vertices will be incorrect, which could lead to the algorithm finding a suboptimal clique.
4. **Incorrect implementation of the edge-finding algorithm.** The edge-finding algorithm used to find the edges between the vertices must be correct in order for the greedy algorithm to work correctly. If the edge-finding algorithm is incorrect, it is possible that the algorithm will miss some of the edges between the vertices, which could lead to the algorithm finding a suboptimal clique.
5. **Incorrect implementation of the clique-finding algorithm.** The clique-finding algorithm used to find the maximum clique in the graph must be correct in order for the greedy algorithm to work correctly. If the clique-finding algorithm is incorrect, it is possible that the algorithm will not find the maximum clique.

### How to avoid these problems and bugs

1. **Test your implementation of the greedy algorithm thoroughly.** Make sure that the algorithm finds the maximum clique in a variety of graphs, including graphs with different numbers of vertices and edges, and graphs with different types of vertices and edges.
2. **Test your implementation of the sorting algorithm thoroughly.** Make sure that the algorithm sorts the vertices in the correct order, even if the vertices have the same weight.
3. **Test your implementation of the distance calculation thoroughly.** Make sure that the distances between the vertices are calculated correctly, even if the vertices have the same coordinate.
4. **Test your implementation of the edge-finding algorithm thoroughly.** Make sure that the algorithm finds all of the edges between the vertices, even if the vertices are very close together.
5. **Test your implementation of the clique-finding algorithm thoroughly.** Make sure that the algorithm finds the maximum clique in the graph, even if the graph has a large number of vertices and edges.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid the most common problems and bugs that developers encounter when solving the clique problem.

CODEFORCES 553_E. Kyoya and Train

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem statement is quite long and detailed, so it is important to read it carefully and make sure you understand all the requirements. For example, it is important to note that Kyoya wants to get to school by spending the least amount of money in expectation, and that he may recalculate his plan based on how much time he has remaining.
* **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution to this problem involves a lot of mathematical calculations, so it is important to make sure that your implementation is correct. For example, you need to be careful when computing the probabilities of different events and when summing up the expected costs.
* **Incorrect test cases.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. This includes testing your solution on a variety of different input values, as well as testing for edge cases.
* **Incorrect analysis of the results.** Once you have tested your solution, you need to carefully analyze the results to make sure that they are correct. This includes checking for any unexpected or incorrect results.

Here are some specific examples of problems and bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* A developer might incorrectly assume that Kyoya can always take the shortest path to school. This is not the case, as Kyoya may need to take a longer path in order to arrive at school on time.
* A developer might incorrectly implement the probability calculations. For example, they might forget to multiply the probabilities of different events together.
* A developer might incorrectly compute the expected cost of the tickets. For example, they might forget to add the cost of the tickets to the expected cost of the fine.
* A developer might incorrectly test their solution. For example, they might only test their solution on a few simple input values.
* A developer might incorrectly analyze the results of their solution. For example, they might not notice that their solution is incorrect for certain input values.

CODEFORCES 624_A. Save Luke

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is given as a string of characters. The developer may mistakenly parse the input data as a string and then try to perform mathematical operations on it. This will result in a **TypeError**.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the time for which Luke can stay alive. For example, the developer may forget to take into account the fact that the presses are moving towards each other. This will result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may make an off-by-one error when calculating the time for which Luke can stay alive. For example, the developer may forget to subtract the width of Luke from the distance between the presses. This will result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Floating-point error**. The developer may make a floating-point error when calculating the time for which Luke can stay alive. This can happen if the developer uses an incorrect rounding method or if the developer uses a floating-point number with too low precision. This will result in an incorrect answer.
5. **Infinite loop**. The developer may create an infinite loop in their code. This can happen if the developer uses a while loop without a terminating condition. This will cause the program to run forever and never terminate.
6. **Stack overflow**. The developer may cause a stack overflow in their code. This can happen if the developer creates too many recursive functions or if the developer uses too much memory. This will cause the program to crash.
7. **Memory leak**. The developer may create a memory leak in their code. This can happen if the developer allocates memory but does not free it up when it is no longer needed. This will cause the program to use more and more memory until it eventually runs out of memory and crashes.

Title:
CODEFORCES 645_E. Intellectual Inquiry

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains two integers n and k, which are the number of tiles and the number of letters Bessie knows, respectively. We need to use an integer data type to store these two values. However, if we accidentally use a smaller data type, such as a short, we may get incorrect results. For example, if n = 1000000 and k = 26, then the value of n * k will overflow a short.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the maximum number of distinct subsequences Bessie can form after labeling the last n sidewalk tiles. One possible algorithm is to enumerate all possible subsequences and then count the number of distinct ones. However, this algorithm is very inefficient, as the number of possible subsequences grows exponentially with n.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement specifies that n and k are non-negative integers. However, if we accidentally input negative values, our program may crash or give incorrect results. We should always check for these edge cases before proceeding with the rest of the algorithm.

**4. Using incorrect math**

The problem statement asks us to print the maximum number of distinct subsequences modulo 109 + 7. However, if we accidentally use the wrong modulus, we may get incorrect results. For example, if we use 100 as the modulus, then the value of 109 + 7 will overflow and we will get incorrect results.

**5. Not using enough memory**

The problem statement does not specify the maximum length of the input string t. However, if we accidentally allocate too little memory for t, our program may crash or give incorrect results. We should always allocate enough memory to store the input string, even if it is very long.

Title:
CODEFORCES 672_C. Recycling Bottles

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is given as a list of integers. However, the distance between two points is a real number. So we need to convert the integers to real numbers before calculating the distance.

**2. Incorrect calculation of distance**

The distance between two points is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. However, the Pythagorean theorem only works for two-dimensional points. In this problem, the points are three-dimensional. So we need to use a different formula to calculate the distance.

**3. Inefficient algorithm**

The naive algorithm for solving this problem is to consider all possible ways of picking up the bottles and then calculate the total distance for each way. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n!^2). We can improve the time complexity by using a dynamic programming approach.

**4. Floating point errors**

When calculating the distance between two points, we need to use floating point numbers. Floating point numbers are not exact, so there is a chance that the calculated distance will be slightly different from the actual distance. This can lead to errors in the final answer.

**5. Overflow errors**

The distance between two points can be very large. If we are not careful, we may overflow the integer data type. We need to use a larger data type to store the distance.

Title:
CODEFORCES 697_E. PLEASE

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem states that the first line of input contains a single integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 105) — the number of elements in array Barney gave you. However, if the input contains more than one integer on the first line, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem states that the only line of output should contain a single string x / y where x is the remainder of dividing p by 109 + 7 and y is the remainder of dividing q by 109 + 7. However, if the output contains more than one string, or if the output does not contain two integers separated by a '/' character, the program will produce a wrong answer.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the probability**. The probability that the girl guessed right is equal to the number of ways to choose two cups out of three cups, which is 3C2 = 3. However, if the program incorrectly calculates the probability, it will produce a wrong answer.
4. **Incorrect use of the greatest common divisor**. The greatest common divisor of two integers a and b is the largest integer d that divides both a and b. However, if the program incorrectly uses the greatest common divisor, it will produce a wrong answer.
5. **Incorrect use of the remainder operator**. The remainder operator (%) returns the remainder of dividing the first operand by the second operand. However, if the program incorrectly uses the remainder operator, it will produce a wrong answer.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and make sure that your program correctly implements the required functionality. Additionally, it is helpful to test your program on a variety of input cases to ensure that it produces the correct output.

CODEFORCES 718_D. Andrew and Chemistry

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly, and that you are not accidentally skipping or misparsing any of the data. For example, if you were to accidentally read the first line of input as `n = 4`, instead of `n = 100000`, you would get a very different answer than the correct one.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer. Make sure that you are not accidentally printing any extra characters, and that your integer is formatted correctly. For example, if you were to print `1234`, instead of `1234`, your answer would be incorrect.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

This problem is full of opportunities for off-by-one errors. For example, if you were to forget to add 1 to the degree of a vertex when you are counting the number of ways to add a new vertex and edge, your answer would be incorrect.

**4. Missing edge cases**

This problem has a few edge cases that you need to be aware of. For example, if the input tree is a star graph, then there is only one way to add a new vertex and edge and still have a tree. Make sure that you are handling all of the edge cases correctly.

**5. Runtime errors**

This problem is not particularly difficult, but it is still possible to make runtime errors. For example, if you were to use an inefficient algorithm to solve the problem, your code could take a very long time to run. Make sure that you are using an efficient algorithm, and that your code is well-written.

3. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over a list of elements, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one or more elements. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Arithmetic errors.** When performing mathematical operations, it is easy to make a mistake and get an incorrect answer. For example, when dividing two numbers, it is important to make sure that the divisor is not zero.
5. **Floating-point errors.** Floating-point numbers are not exact representations of real numbers, and this can lead to errors in calculations. For example, the following two floating-point numbers are not equal:
```
0.1 + 0.2
0.3
```
6. **Boundary errors.** When dealing with ranges of numbers, it is important to make sure that the values are within the correct range. For example, if a program is expecting a number between 0 and 1, and the user enters a number outside of this range, the program may crash.
7. **Null pointer errors.** When a pointer is assigned to a null value, it can lead to errors in the program. For example, if a function tries to access a memory location that is not allocated, the program may crash.
8. **Memory leaks.** When a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed, this can lead to memory leaks. Memory leaks can eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
9. **Race conditions.** When two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time, this can lead to errors in the program. For example, if two threads try to update the same variable at the same time, the value of the variable may be incorrect.
10. **Deadlocks.** When two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, this can lead to a deadlock. A deadlock can prevent any of the threads from continuing execution, and the program may crash.

CODEFORCES 832_C. Strange Radiation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly calculating the time it takes for a person to reach a point.** This is a common mistake that can be made when the person's speed is not constant. For example, if a person is running at a speed of 100 m/s and they need to travel 1000 m, they will not reach their destination in 10 seconds. This is because the person's speed will decrease over time due to air resistance. To calculate the correct time, you need to use an equation that takes into account the person's acceleration.
2. **Not considering the effects of the strange rays.** The strange rays in this problem can have a significant impact on the time it takes for a person to reach a point. For example, if a person is running at a speed of 100 m/s and they are hit by a strange ray that increases their speed by 50%, they will reach their destination in 8 seconds instead of 10 seconds. To correctly calculate the time it takes for a person to reach a point, you need to take into account the effects of the strange rays.
3. **Using incorrect data types.** When working with floating-point numbers, it is important to use the correct data types. For example, if you are using a data type that can only store 16 bits of precision, you will not be able to represent numbers with more than 16 digits of precision. This can lead to errors in your calculations. To avoid this problem, you should always use the highest precision data type that is available.
4. **Not handling edge cases correctly.** There are a number of edge cases that you need to be aware of when solving this problem. For example, what happens if a person is standing at the point 0 or 106? What happens if a person's speed is 0? What happens if a person is hit by a strange ray that increases their speed to infinity? You need to make sure that your code handles all of these edge cases correctly.
5. **Not using a robust algorithm.** The algorithm that you use to solve this problem should be robust to errors in the input data. For example, what happens if the input data contains a negative number? What happens if the input data contains a number that is too large? You need to make sure that your algorithm can handle these errors gracefully.

CODEFORCES 853_A. Planning

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a negative number, a number that is too large, or two numbers separated by a space instead of a comma.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may contain a number that is not an integer, or two numbers separated by a comma instead of a space.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum cost**. The minimum cost may not be calculated correctly. For example, the minimum cost may be calculated by adding up the costs of delaying all the flights, instead of subtracting the costs of the flights that were able to depart on time.
4. **Incorrect order of the flights**. The flights may not be in the correct order. For example, the flights may be ordered by their cost instead of their original order.
5. **Incorrect number of flights**. The number of flights may not be correct. For example, the number of flights may be less than the number of flights in the input, or more than the number of flights in the input.
6. **Other bugs**. There may be other bugs in the code that are not listed here. For example, the code may not be able to handle all possible input cases, or the code may be inefficient.

CODEFORCES 877_E. Danil and a Part-time Job

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The tree traversal algorithm should visit each vertex exactly once, and the order in which the vertices are visited should not matter.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the light switching algorithm.** This is another common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The light switching algorithm should switch the light on in all vertices of the subtree of the given vertex, and switch the light off in all other vertices.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the get query algorithm.** This is a less common mistake, but it can still lead to incorrect results. The get query algorithm should return the number of vertices in the subtree of the given vertex for which the light is turned on.
4. **Incorrect implementation of the output format.** The output format for this problem is very specific. Make sure that your output matches the expected format exactly.
5. **Incorrect handling of errors.** This problem does not contain any errors, but it is important to be aware of the possibility of errors in input data. Your program should be able to handle errors gracefully without crashing or producing incorrect output.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use a well-tested and documented tree traversal algorithm.
* Use a well-tested and documented light switching algorithm.
* Use a well-tested and documented get query algorithm.
* Make sure that your output format matches the expected format exactly.
* Handle errors gracefully.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs that developers may encounter when solving this problem.

CODEFORCES 901_A. Hashing Trees

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific. Make sure that you are reading the input correctly and that you are not missing or adding any characters.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When you are working with arrays or lists, it is very easy to make a mistake and accidentally add or remove one element. This can lead to incorrect results, so be careful when you are working with these data structures.
3. **Incorrect traversal order.** When you are traversing a tree, it is important to make sure that you are visiting the nodes in the correct order. If you visit the nodes in the wrong order, you may get incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect parent pointers.** When you are building a tree, it is important to make sure that the parent pointers are correct. If the parent pointers are incorrect, the tree will not be valid and you will get incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect adjacency lists.** When you are using adjacency lists to represent a graph, it is important to make sure that the lists are correct. If the adjacency lists are incorrect, the graph will not be valid and you will get incorrect results.
6. **Incorrect topological sort.** When you are performing a topological sort on a graph, it is important to make sure that the sort is correct. If the sort is incorrect, you may get incorrect results.
7. **Incorrect graph isomorphism check.** When you are checking if two graphs are isomorphic, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct algorithm. If you are not using the correct algorithm, you may get incorrect results.
8. **Incorrect output format.** The output format for this problem is very specific. Make sure that you are printing the output in the correct format. If you are not printing the output in the correct format, you will not get credit for your solution.

Title:
CODEFORCES 923_D. Picking Strings

Pain points:
**1. Off-by-one errors**

When working with indices, it is easy to make a mistake and go off-by-one. For example, if you are trying to find the index of the first occurrence of a character in a string, you might accidentally start your search at index 0 instead of index 1. This could lead to incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect assumptions**

When solving a problem, it is important to make sure that you are not making any incorrect assumptions. For example, you might assume that a certain data structure or algorithm will work in a certain way, when in reality it does not. This could lead to incorrect results or even errors in your code.

**3. Using incorrect data types**

It is important to use the correct data types when solving a problem. For example, if you are trying to store a number that can be negative, you should use an integer data type instead of a floating-point data type. This will prevent you from getting unexpected results.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

When solving a problem, it is important to make sure that you handle all of the edge cases. For example, if you are writing a program that sorts a list of numbers, you need to make sure that the list is not empty. If you do not handle this edge case, your program will crash.

**5. Using inefficient algorithms**

When solving a problem, it is important to use an efficient algorithm. An efficient algorithm is one that takes a reasonable amount of time to run, even on large data sets. For example, if you are trying to find the largest element in a list of numbers, you should use a binary search algorithm instead of a linear search algorithm. A binary search algorithm is much more efficient than a linear search algorithm, so it will take less time to run.
Test inputs:
**Incorrect assumptions**

```
S = input()
T = input()
Q = int(input())
for _ in range(Q):
    a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
    s = S[a-1:b]
    t = T[c-1:d]
    print(1 if s == t or t == 'A' else 0)
```

This code will not work correctly because it assumes that the strings S and T are the same length. This is not always the case, and if the strings are not the same length, the code will not be able to determine whether the target string can be obtained from the source string.

**Using incorrect data types**

```
S = input()
T = input()
Q = int(input())
for _ in range(Q):
    a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
    s = S[a-1:b]
    t = T[c-1:d]
    print(1 if s == t or t == 'A' else 0)
```

This code will not work correctly because it is using the incorrect data types. The variable `a` should be a string, not an integer. This is because the input is a string, and we need to be able to compare strings to each other.

**Not handling edge cases**

```
S = input()
T = input()
Q = int(input())
for _ in range(Q):
    a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
    s = S[a-1:b]
    t = T[c-1:d]
    print(1 if s == t or t == 'A' else 0)
```

This code will not work correctly because it does not handle the edge case where the target string is longer than the source string. In this case, the code will always return 0, even if the target string can be obtained from the source string by applying the transitions.

**Using inefficient algorithms**

```
S = input()
T = input()
Q = int(input())
for _ in range(Q):
    a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
    s = S[a-1:b]
    t = T[c-1:d]
    print(1 if s == t or t == 'A' else 0)
```

This code will not work correctly because it is using an inefficient algorithm. The algorithm iterates over the entire string S, even if the target string is only a small part of S. This can be very inefficient, especially if the string S is very long.

Here are some improved program inputs that will validate whether an implementation meets each of the requirements:

**Off-by-one errors**

```
S = 'A'
T = 'A'
Q = 1
a, b, c, d = 1, 1, 1, 1

print(1 if S[a-1:b] == T[c-1:d] else 0)
```

This program will print 1, because the source string and the target string are the same.

**Incorrect assumptions**

```
S = 'A'
T = 'B'
Q = 1
a, b, c, d = 1, 1, 1, 1

print(1 if S[a-1:b] == T[c-1:d] or t == 'A' else 0)
```

This program will print 0, because the source string and the target string are not the same.

**Using incorrect data types**

```
S = 'A'
T = 'B'
Q = 1
a, b, c, d = 1, 1, 1, 1

print(1 if S[a-1:b] == T[c-1:d] else 0)
```

This program will print 0, because the variable `a` is a string, not an integer.

**Not handling edge cases**

S = 'A'
T = 'B'
Q = 1
a, b, c, d = 1, 1, 1, 1

Pain points:
```
1. The input format is not correct. For example, if the input is `1 2`, the program should output `Error` instead of crashing.
2. The program may not handle the case where `k` is greater than `n`. For example, if the input is `5 6`, the program should output `Error` instead of crashing.
3. The program may not handle the case where the string contains characters other than lowercase Latin letters. For example, if the input is `5 a123`, the program should output `Error` instead of crashing.
4. The program may not handle the case where the string is empty. For example, if the input is `0 1`, the program should output `` instead of crashing.
5. The program may not handle the case where the string contains only one character. For example, if the input is `1 1`, the program should output `` instead of crashing.
6. The program may not handle the case where the string contains multiple occurrences of the same character. For example, if the input is `5 aaa`, the program should output `` instead of crashing.
7. The program may not handle the case where the string contains multiple occurrences of different characters. For example, if the input is `5 abc`, the program should output `bc` instead of crashing.
8. The program may not handle the case where the string is not sorted in alphabetical order. For example, if the input is `5 cba`, the program should output `Error` instead of crashing.

HACKEREARTH benny-and-her-school-reports

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The variable `N` should be an integer, but it is defined as a string. This will cause a `TypeError`.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator.** The condition `N > 10^5` should be `N <= 10^5`. This will cause a `ValueError`.
3. **Incorrect indentation.** The code inside the `for` loop is not indented correctly. This will cause a `SyntaxError`.
4. **Missing semicolon.** The statement `print(min(sum(A) - X, M))` is missing a semicolon. This will cause a `SyntaxError`.
5. **Incorrect variable name.** The variable `A` is used to store the scores for the first `N` subjects, but it is also used to store the minimum possible score needed in the last subject. This will cause a `NameError`.

To avoid these problems, make sure to:

HACKEREARTH colour-queries

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly handling the boundary conditions.** The problem statement specifies that the grid is initially plain white, and that adjacent cells are right, left, up, and down to the current cell. This means that you need to be careful to handle the boundary conditions correctly. For example, if the query is "x y d" and x is 0, then the cell to the left of (x, y) is not adjacent to (x, y). Similarly, if y is 0, then the cell above (x, y) is not adjacent to (x, y). You need to make sure that you don't try to color these cells black.
2. **Not considering all possible cases.** The problem statement states that you need to color each cell in the grid to black, such that at least one of its adjacent cell is colored black and the absolute difference of value between current cell and adjacent colored cell is ≤ d. However, it doesn't specify what to do if there are no adjacent cells that are colored black. You need to make sure that you handle this case correctly.
3. **Using incorrect data types.** The problem statement specifies that the values of the cells in the grid can be any integer between -100000 and 100000. This means that you need to use a data type that can store these values. For example, if you use an integer data type, you may not be able to store the value -100000.
4. **Making a mistake in your algorithm.** The algorithm that you use to solve this problem needs to be correct. If you make a mistake in your algorithm, you may not get the correct answer. For example, if you forget to update the value of a cell after you color it black, you may end up coloring more cells black than you need to.
5. **Not using efficient data structures.** The problem statement specifies that you need to process q queries. This means that you need to use an efficient data structure to store the results of the queries. For example, if you use a linked list to store the results of the queries, you may not be able to process all of the queries in time.

Title:
HACKEREARTH fibo-stones

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Fibonacci sequence.** The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. For example, the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and the next numbers are 0 + 1 = 1, 1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, and so on. A common mistake is to implement the Fibonacci sequence incorrectly, by adding the current number and the next number instead of the two preceding numbers. This will result in a different sequence of numbers, which will not be the Fibonacci sequence.
2. **Off-by-one error.** Another common mistake is to make an off-by-one error when computing the sum of the Fibonacci numbers. For example, if you are computing the sum of the Fibonacci numbers from 0 to 10, you might accidentally start with the number 1 instead of 0. This will result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect use of the modulus operator.** The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 is 1, because 10 divided by 3 has a remainder of 1. A common mistake is to use the modulus operator incorrectly, for example by using it to check if a number is divisible by another number. This can result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect use of the range() function.** The range() function in Python returns a sequence of numbers from a starting number to an ending number, excluding the ending number. For example, range(5) returns the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. A common mistake is to use the range() function incorrectly, for example by using it to iterate over a sequence of numbers that does not start at 0. This can result in an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect use of the sum() function.** The sum() function in Python returns the sum of the elements in a sequence. For example, sum([1, 2, 3]) returns 6. A common mistake is to use the sum() function incorrectly, for example by passing it a sequence of numbers that does not contain any numbers. This can result in an incorrect answer.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to carefully write and test your code to ensure that it is correct.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the `set` data structure.** The `set` data structure is used to store unique elements, but it does not preserve the order of the elements. This can lead to incorrect results if the order of the elements is important.
2. **Using a `for` loop to iterate over the elements of a `set`.** The `set` data structure does not support iteration, so using a `for` loop to iterate over the elements of a `set` will result in an error.
3. **Using the `len()` function to get the number of elements in a `set`.** The `len()` function returns the number of elements in a list or tuple, but it does not work for sets.
4. **Not handling the case where the input string is empty.** If the input string is empty, the `set()` function will return an empty set, which will result in a zero being printed as the output.
5. **Not handling the case where the input string contains duplicate words.** If the input string contains duplicate words, the `set()` function will only store one copy of each word, which will result in an incorrect number of unique words being printed as the output.

C(n, m) = C(n, m - 1) + C(n - 1, m)
```

where C(n, k) denotes the number of combinations of n elements taken k at a time.

If we use an incorrect formula, we may get the wrong answer.

**3. Using incorrect algorithm**

The naive algorithm to solve this problem is to enumerate all possible bit-strings of length n and check if each bit-string satisfies the given constraints. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(2^n).

A more efficient algorithm to solve this problem is to use dynamic programming. The idea is to store the number of combinations of bit-size i in which there are no m consecutive 1's in a table. Then, we can use this table to calculate the number of combinations of bit-size n in which there are no m consecutive 1's. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2).

**4. Not handling edge cases**

We should be careful to handle edge cases when solving this problem. For example, if m is greater than n, then the answer is 0. We should also handle the case where n is 0 or 1.

**5. Using incorrect code**

We should be careful to write correct code when solving this problem. We should use a programming language that we are familiar with and that we are comfortable using. We should also make sure to test our code thoroughly before submitting it.

HACKEREARTH question-2-20

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input is a list of integers, but the developer may accidentally use a list of strings. This would cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the number of functions possible. For example, they may forget to multiply the number of elements in the domain by the number of elements in the range.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may accidentally miscount the number of elements in the domain or range. This would cause the program to output the wrong answer.

1. **Incorrectly identifying the type of query.** The first line of the input contains two integers, `N` and `Q`, which represent the number of elements in the array and the number of queries, respectively. The second line contains `N` integers, which represent the elements of the array. The third line contains `Q` queries, each of which is either of type `1` or `2`. A query of type `1` is of the form `l r`, where `l` and `r` are the indices of the first and last elements of the range to be searched, respectively. A query of type `2` is of the form `i k`, where `i` is the index of the element to be updated and `k` is the new value of the element.

**Example:**

```
Input:
5 5
1 2 33 456 111
1 1 2
1 1 5
2 1 6
2 2 1000
1 1 5

Output:
2
4
3
```

In this example, the first query is of type `1` and asks for the number of round numbers in the range `[1, 2]`. The second query is also of type `1` and asks for the number of round numbers in the range `[1, 5]`. The third query is of type `2` and updates the value of the element at index `1` to `6`. The fourth query is also of type `2` and updates the value of the element at index `2` to `1000`. The fifth query is of type `1` and asks for the number of round numbers in the range `[1, 5]`.

**Solution:**

The following code correctly identifies the type of query and performs the appropriate operation:

```python
def solve():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(q):
        t, l, r = map(int, input().split())
        if t == 1:
            print(count_round_numbers(a, l, r))
        else:
            a[l - 1] = r

def count_round_numbers(a, l, r):
    count = 0
    for i in range(l, r + 1):
        if a[i] > 0 and a[i] % 10 == a[i][-1]:
            count += 1
    return count

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```

2. **Incorrectly calculating the number of round numbers in a range.** The number of round numbers in a range can be calculated by finding the number of elements in the range that are divisible by 10 and have the same first and last digits.

**Example:**

```
Input:
5 5
1 2 33 456 111
1 1 2
1 1 5
2 1 6
2 2 1000
1 1 5

Output:
2
4
3
```

In this example, the number of round numbers in the range `[1, 2]` is 2 because the elements at indices `1` and `2` are both divisible by 10 and have the same first and last digits. The number of round numbers in the range `[1, 5]` is 4 because the elements at indices `1`, `2`, `3`, and `5` are all divisible by 10 and have the same first and last digits. The number of round numbers in the range `[1, 6]` is 3 because the elements at indices `1`, `3`, and `5` are all divisible by 10 and have the same first and last digits. The number of round numbers in the range `[2, 2]` is 0 because there are no elements in the range that are divisible by 10 and have the same first and last digits.

**Solution:**

The following code correctly calculates the number of round numbers in a range:

```python
def count_round_numbers(a, l, r):
    count = 0
    for i in range(l, r + 1):
        if a[i] > 0 and a[i] % 10 == a[i][-1] and a[

Title:
HACKEREARTH the-magical-shop

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data is given as two integers and a string. It is important to make sure that the data types are correct. For example, if the input data is `5 100 101`, the first two values should be parsed as integers, and the third value should be parsed as a string. If the data types are incorrect, the program will not work correctly.

**2. Using incorrect operators**

The problem statement specifies that the answer must be modulo B. This means that the answer must be a number that is less than B. If the answer is greater than B, it must be reduced modulo B. For example, if the answer is 101 and B is 100, the answer must be reduced to 1. It is important to make sure that the correct operators are used to perform the modulo operation.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The problem statement specifies that the number of potions on the Ith day is equal to the number of potions on the (I-1)th day multiplied by itself. This means that the number of potions on the Ith day is a function of the number of potions on the (I-1)th day. It is important to make sure that this logic is correct.

**4. Using incorrect code**

The code that you write to solve the problem must be correct. This means that the code must be syntactically correct and must not contain any errors. It is important to test your code carefully before submitting it.

**5. Not understanding the problem statement**

The most important problem that a developer may encounter when solving this problem is not understanding the problem statement. The problem statement is very clear, but it is important to read it carefully and make sure that you understand all of the details. If you do not understand the problem statement, you will not be able to solve the problem correctly.

Title:
HACKEREARTH zrzr

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input and output of this problem are integers. However, if the developer uses a floating-point type to store the input, they may get incorrect results. For example, if the input is 10, the developer may store it as 10.0. When they calculate 10!, they will get 3628800.0. However, the correct answer is 3628800. When the developer prints the answer, they will get 3.6288e+06, which is not the same as 3628800.

**2. Not considering the special case of 0**

The factorial of 0 is 1. However, some developers may forget to consider this case and return 0 for the input 0.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The naive algorithm for calculating the factorial of a number is to multiply the number by all the numbers below it. For example, to calculate 10!, the developer would multiply 10 by 9 by 8 by 7 by 6 by 5 by 4 by 3 by 2 by 1. This algorithm is very inefficient, as it takes O(n!) time to calculate the factorial of a number n.

A more efficient algorithm for calculating the factorial of a number is to use the following formula:

```
n! = (n + 1)! / (n + 1)
```

This algorithm takes O(n) time to calculate the factorial of a number n.

**4. Not handling overflow**

When calculating the factorial of a large number, the developer may encounter an overflow error. This is because the factorial of a number n is greater than or equal to n!. For example, the factorial of 10 is greater than or equal to 10! = 3628800. If the developer uses a 32-bit integer to store the factorial of a number, they may encounter an overflow error when the number is greater than or equal to 2147483647.

To avoid this problem, the developer can use a 64-bit integer to store the factorial of a number.

**5. Not handling negative numbers**

The factorial of a negative number is undefined. However, some developers may try to calculate the factorial of a negative number and get incorrect results.

To avoid this problem, the developer should check if the input is a negative number and return an error if it is.

Title:
ATCODER p02665 NOMURA Programming Competition 2020 - Folia

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the binary tree traversal algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The traversal algorithm should visit each node in the tree exactly once, and the order in which the nodes are visited should not matter.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of vertices in the tree.** This is another common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The maximum number of vertices in a binary tree is 2^N - 1, where N is the depth of the tree.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The input to this problem may contain edge cases, such as a tree with no leaves or a tree with a single leaf. The solution must be able to handle these edge cases correctly.
4. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The solution to this problem requires the use of data structures such as arrays and linked lists. The solution must use these data structures correctly in order to produce correct results.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The solution must be able to handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input is invalid, the solution should print an error message and exit.

Title:
ATCODER p02794 AtCoder Beginner Contest 152 - Tree and Constraints

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is:

```
N
a_1 b_1
:
a_{N-1} b_{N-1}
M
u_1 v_1
:
u_M v_M
```

where `N` is the number of vertices in the tree, and `a_i` and `b_i` are the endpoints of the `i`th edge in the tree. `M` is the number of constraints, and `u_i` and `v_i` are the endpoints of the `i`th constraint.

If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect tree traversal**

The program must traverse the tree in a way that ensures that all of the constraints are satisfied. One way to do this is to use a depth-first search (DFS).

When traversing the tree, the program must keep track of the edges that have already been painted black. If the program reaches a vertex that is the endpoint of a constraint, it must check to see if the edge that connects that vertex to its parent has already been painted black. If it has not been painted black, the program must paint it black.

If the program reaches a vertex that has no outgoing edges, it must check to see if all of the constraints that involve that vertex have been satisfied. If not, the program must return an incorrect answer.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the number of ways to paint the edges**

Once the program has finished traversing the tree, it must calculate the number of ways to paint the edges that satisfy all of the constraints.

To do this, the program must first find the number of ways to paint each edge in the tree. The number of ways to paint an edge is equal to `2` if the edge is not part of a constraint, and it is equal to `1` if the edge is part of a constraint.

Once the program has calculated the number of ways to paint each edge, it must multiply these numbers together to get the total number of ways to paint the edges that satisfy all of the constraints.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer that represents the number of ways to paint the edges that satisfy all of the constraints.

If the program does not output a single integer, or if the output integer is not correct, the program will receive a wrong answer.

**5. Other bugs**

There are a number of other potential bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:

* Using the wrong data type for the input or output
* Using incorrect logic to traverse the tree or calculate the number of ways to paint the edges
* Making a mistake in the code

By carefully following the instructions and avoiding these common pitfalls, developers can avoid most of the problems that can occur when solving this problem.

1. **Incorrect input type**. The input is given in the format `N X`, where `N` and `X` are integers. However, the developer may mistakenly parse `N` and `X` as strings, which will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect modulo operation**. The output should be modulo 998244353. However, the developer may forget to perform the modulo operation, which will cause the output to be incorrect.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may mistakenly count one too many or one too few sequences that satisfy the condition. This can be caused by a mistake in the algorithm or by a mistake in the implementation.
4. **Infinite loop**. The developer may write an infinite loop in their code. This can be caused by a mistake in the algorithm or by a mistake in the implementation.
5. **Memory leak**. The developer may create a memory leak in their code. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
6. **Stack overflow**. The developer may cause a stack overflow in their code. This can happen when the program recursively calls itself too many times.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem asks for the number of patties in the bottom-most X layers from the bottom of a level-N burger, but a developer might mistakenly think that it asks for the total number of patties in the burger.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the recursive solution.** The recursive solution to this problem is quite straightforward, but a developer might make mistakes in implementing it, such as using the wrong base case or forgetting to update the state variables.
3. **Incorrect use of memoization.** Memoization can be a powerful tool for speeding up recursive solutions, but a developer must use it correctly in order to get the desired results. For example, a developer might forget to initialize the memoization table or might use the wrong values for the keys.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem specifies a few edge cases, such as N = 0 or X = 0. A developer must be careful to handle these cases correctly in order to avoid errors.
5. **Incorrect testing.** A developer should always test their code thoroughly before submitting it, especially for a challenging problem like this one. This includes testing for all of the different edge cases and verifying that the code produces the correct results.

Title:
ATCODER p03358 AtCoder Regular Contest 097 - Monochrome Cat

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect graph representation**

The input format specifies that the graph is represented by a list of edges, where each edge is a pair of vertices. However, some solutions incorrectly represent the graph as a list of adjacency lists, where each adjacency list is a list of vertices adjacent to the given vertex. This can lead to incorrect results, as the two representations of the graph are not equivalent.

**2. Incorrect traversal of the graph**

Some solutions incorrectly traverse the graph, starting at a vertex that is not connected to any other vertices. This can lead to the solution getting stuck in a loop, and never finishing.

**3. Incorrect coloring of the vertices**

Some solutions incorrectly color the vertices, either by not coloring all of the vertices or by coloring them in the wrong order. This can lead to the solution taking longer than necessary to achieve the objective.

**4. Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of seconds**

Some solutions incorrectly calculate the minimum number of seconds required to achieve the objective. This can lead to the solution returning an incorrect answer.

**5. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

Some solutions do not handle edge cases correctly, such as when the graph is empty or when all of the vertices are already black. This can lead to the solution crashing or returning an incorrect answer.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the constraints. It is also important to test your solution thoroughly, to ensure that it works correctly on all possible inputs.

ATCODER p03679 AtCoder Beginner Contest 065 - Expired?

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for `X`, `A`, or `B`.**

The problem states that `1 ≤ X,A,B ≤ 10^9`, so we need to use a data type that can store numbers that large. `int` is not large enough, so we need to use `long long`.

**2. Not taking into account the fact that `A` and `B` can be negative.**

The problem states that `A` and `B` can be negative, so we need to make sure to check for this case and handle it correctly.

**3. Not taking into account the fact that `X + A` can be greater than `B`.**

The problem states that `X + A` is the number of days before the "best-by" date, and `B` is the number of days after the food was bought. So, it's possible that `X + A` is greater than `B`, which would mean that the food was eaten before the "best-by" date. In this case, we need to print `delicious`.

**4. Not taking into account the fact that `X + A` can be less than `0`.**

The problem states that `X + A` is the number of days before the "best-by" date. So, it's possible that `X + A` is less than `0`, which would mean that the food was eaten after the "best-by" date. In this case, we need to print `dangerous`.

**5. Not taking into account the fact that `X + A` can be equal to `0`.**

The problem states that `X + A` is the number of days before the "best-by" date. So, it's possible that `X + A` is equal to `0`, which would mean that the food was eaten on the "best-by" date. In this case, we need to print `safe`.

Pain points:
### 1. The input string may not be in the correct format.

The input string is supposed to be in the format `[five lowercase English letters],[seven lowercase English letters],[five lowercase English letters]`. However, the developer may not check the format of the input string and assume that it is always in the correct format. This can lead to errors in the output.

### 2. The developer may not correctly handle the comma characters in the input string.

The input string contains two comma characters, one at the sixth character and one at the fourteenth character. The developer may not correctly handle these comma characters and accidentally output the comma characters as part of the output string. This can lead to errors in the output.

### 3. The developer may not correctly handle the spaces in the input string.

The input string may contain spaces between the words. The developer may not correctly handle these spaces and accidentally output the spaces as part of the output string. This can lead to errors in the output.

### 4. The developer may not correctly handle the case of the letters in the input string.

The input string may contain both lowercase and uppercase letters. The developer may not correctly handle the case of the letters and accidentally output the letters in the wrong case. This can lead to errors in the output.

### 5. The developer may not correctly handle the length of the input string.

The input string is supposed to be 19 characters long. However, the developer may not check the length of the input string and accidentally output an incorrect number of characters. This can lead to errors in the output.

**2. Using the wrong data type**

The input string S is a string of digits. We need to convert it to a list of integers so that we can add the digits. We can do this using the `list()` function.

**3. Not handling the case where there are no digits in the string S**

If there are no digits in the string S, the output should be 0. We can check for this case using the `len()` function.

**4. Not handling the case where there are multiple consecutive `+` characters in the string S**

The problem statement states that `+` must not occur consecutively after insertion. We need to check for this case and raise an error if it occurs.

**5. Not handling the case where the string S is empty**

The problem statement does not explicitly state that the string S cannot be empty. However, we can assume that this is not allowed. We can check for this case using the `len()` function.

**6. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The naive algorithm for solving this problem would be to iterate over all possible ways to insert `+` characters into the string S and then evaluate each formula. This algorithm would have a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the string S.

A more efficient algorithm would be to use dynamic programming. We can create a table where each entry stores the sum of the evaluated values for all formulas that can be obtained by inserting `+` characters into the first i characters of the string S. This algorithm would have a time complexity of O(n).

Title:
AIZU p00381 Transporter

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is "$N$
$s$
$t$". If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash. For example, if the input is "6
abbb
bab" instead of "6
abbaba
baabab", the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is "the remainder of the number of possible routes divided by 1,000,000,007". If the output format is incorrect, the program will get a wrong answer. For example, if the output is "5" instead of "4", the program will get a wrong answer.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the number of possible routes**

The number of possible routes is calculated by the following formula:

```
number of possible routes = (number of ways to go from star 1 to star N using the entrance) * (number of ways to go from star N to star 1 using the exit)
```

If the calculation of the number of possible routes is incorrect, the program will get a wrong answer. For example, if the number of possible routes is calculated as "5" instead of "4", the program will get a wrong answer.

**4. Incorrect modulo operation**

The number of possible routes is divided by 1,000,000,007. If the modulo operation is incorrect, the program will get a wrong answer. For example, if the modulo operation is performed as "number of possible routes % 1000000007" instead of "(number of possible routes) % 1000000007", the program will get a wrong answer.

Title:
AIZU p01751 Yamanote Line

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format is specified as follows:

```
a b c
```

where `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 60. However, a developer may accidentally input a string or a non-integer value, which will cause the program to crash.

To avoid this problem, the developer should validate the input format before processing it. This can be done using the `int()` function in Python or the `isdigit()` function in Java.

### 2. Incorrect calculation of the arrival time

The arrival time is calculated as follows:

```
arrival_time = 60 * t + c
```

where `t` is the number of laps around the Yamanote line and `c` is the time it takes to get to the destination after boarding. However, a developer may accidentally calculate the arrival time incorrectly, which could lead to the wrong answer.

To avoid this problem, the developer should carefully check the calculation of the arrival time. This can be done by using a debugger or by manually verifying the results.

### 3. Incorrect output

The output should be the arrival time in minutes. However, a developer may accidentally output the arrival time in seconds or hours, which will be incorrect.

To avoid this problem, the developer should carefully check the output format. This can be done by using a formatter or by manually verifying the results.

### 4. Missing boundary conditions

The problem statement specifies that Mr. A will miss his destination if he is sleeping when he arrives. However, a developer may accidentally forget to check this condition, which could lead to the wrong answer.

To avoid this problem, the developer should carefully check the boundary conditions for the problem. This can be done by using a debugger or by manually verifying the results.

Title:
AIZU p02170 Coin and Die

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect usage of modulo operator**

The modulo operator (%) is often used incorrectly in programming competitions. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
x = 100
y = 101
print(x % y)
```

This code will print 1, but the correct answer is 100. The reason for this is that the modulo operator returns the remainder of the division of x by y. In this case, x is divided by y, and the remainder is 1.

To fix this code, we can use the following code:

```
x = 100
y = 101
print(x - (x // y) * y)
```

This code will print 100, which is the correct answer.

**2. Incorrect use of floating-point numbers**

Floating-point numbers are often used incorrectly in programming competitions. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
x = 0.1 + 0.2
print(x)
```

This code will print 0.30000000000000004, which is not the correct answer. The reason for this is that floating-point numbers are not stored exactly in computers. Instead, they are stored as approximations. This means that when you perform arithmetic operations on floating-point numbers, you may get rounding errors.

To fix this code, we can use the following code:

```
x = 0.1 + 0.2
print(round(x, 3))
```

This code will print 0.3, which is the correct answer.

**3. Incorrect use of Boolean operators**

The Boolean operators && and || are often used incorrectly in programming competitions. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
x = True
y = False
z = x && y
print(z)
```

This code will print True, but the correct answer is False. The reason for this is that the && operator only returns True if both operands are True. In this case, x is True and y is False, so the && operator returns False.

To fix this code, we can use the following code:

```
x = True
y = False
z = x || y
print(z)
```

This code will print True, which is the correct answer.

**4. Incorrect use of loops**

Loops are often used incorrectly in programming competitions. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

This code will print the numbers 0 to 9, but the correct answer is 1 to 10. The reason for this is that the range() function returns the numbers from 0 to n-1, where n is the specified number.

To fix this code, we can use the following code:

```
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
```

This code will print the numbers 1 to 10, which is the correct answer.

**5. Incorrect use of functions**

Functions are often used incorrectly in programming competitions. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
def f(x):
    return x + 1

print(f(1))
```

This code will print 2, but the correct answer is 3. The reason for this is that the f() function is not called with the correct arguments.

To fix this code, we can use the following code:

```
def f(x):
    return x + 1

print(f(1))
```

This code will print 3, which is the correct answer.

## 1. Using a list to store the key-value pairs

The problem states that each key in $M$ must be unique. So we can use a list to store the key-value pairs. However, if we insert a key that already exists in the list, the new value will overwrite the old value. This is not what we want.

## 2. Using a dictionary to store the key-value pairs

A dictionary is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. The keys in a dictionary must be unique. So we can use a dictionary to store the key-value pairs. This will solve the problem of overwriting the old value.

## 3. Using a hash table to store the key-value pairs

A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. The keys in a hash table are hashed to a unique index. This means that we can quickly find the value for a given key.

## 4. Using a binary search tree to store the key-value pairs

A binary search tree is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. The keys in a binary search tree are sorted. This means that we can quickly find the value for a given key.

## 5. Using a balanced binary tree to store the key-value pairs

A balanced binary tree is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. The keys in a balanced binary tree are sorted and the tree is balanced. This means that we can quickly find the value for a given key and the tree is efficient to maintain.

## 6. Using a self-balancing binary search tree to store the key-value pairs

A self-balancing binary search tree is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. The keys in a self-balancing binary search tree are sorted and the tree is always balanced. This means that we can quickly find the value for a given key and the tree is efficient to maintain.

## 7. Using a B-tree to store the key-value pairs

A B-tree is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. The keys in a B-tree are sorted and the tree is balanced. B-trees are more efficient than binary search trees for storing large amounts of data.

## 8. Using a B+ tree to store the key-value pairs

A B+ tree is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. The keys in a B+ tree are sorted and the tree is balanced. B+ trees are more efficient than B-trees for storing large amounts of data.

## 9. Using a Trie to store the key-value pairs

A Trie is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. The keys in a Trie are strings. Tries are efficient for storing and searching for strings.

## 10. Using a suffix array to store the key-value pairs

A suffix array is a data structure that stores the suffixes of a string. The suffixes in a suffix array are sorted. Suffix arrays are efficient for finding all occurrences of a pattern in a string.
