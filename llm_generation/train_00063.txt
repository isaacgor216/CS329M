CODECHEF bestbats

Pain points:
So, there are 6 possible ways. **1. The input format is not clear.**

The input format is not clear. It is not clear how the scores of the players are given. Are they given in a single line, or are they given in multiple lines? It is also not clear how the number of players is given. Is it given in a single line, or is it given in multiple lines?

**2. The output format is not clear.**

The output format is not clear. It is not clear how the number of ways to select exactly K players such that the sum of their scores is the maximum possible is given. Is it given in a single line, or is it given in multiple lines?

**3. The problem is not well-defined.**

The problem is not well-defined. It is not clear what it means to select exactly K players such that the sum of their scores is the maximum possible. Does this mean that the sum of the scores of the selected players must be the same? Or does it mean that the sum of the scores of the selected players must be as large as possible?

**4. The problem is too difficult.**

The problem is too difficult. It is not clear how to solve the problem without using a brute-force approach. A brute-force approach would simply try to select all possible combinations of K players and then check which combination has the maximum sum of scores. This approach would be very time-consuming and would not scale well to large problems.

**5. The problem is not interesting.**

The problem is not interesting. There is no real-world application for this problem.

Title:
CODECHEF cn03

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain a number that is too large or too small. The developer should check the input format and handle incorrect input gracefully.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correct. For example, the output may contain a number that is too large or too small. The developer should check the output format and handle incorrect output gracefully.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the developer may use a brute-force algorithm that is too slow. The developer should use a more efficient algorithm to solve the problem.
4. **Incorrect data structures**. The developer may use incorrect data structures to store the input data. For example, the developer may use a linked list to store the input data, which is not efficient for this problem. The developer should use a more efficient data structure to store the input data.
5. **Incorrect error handling**. The developer may not handle errors correctly. For example, the developer may not handle the case where the input data is incorrect. The developer should handle errors correctly to ensure that the program runs correctly.
6. **Incorrect unit testing**. The developer may not unit test the code correctly. For example, the developer may not test all of the code paths. The developer should unit test the code correctly to ensure that the program is correct.

Title:
CODECHEF forestga

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrectly calculating the number of months needed to fulfill the order.** This is a common mistake that can be made when the trees are growing at different rates. To avoid this, it is important to keep track of the total height of the trees and the amount of wood that is needed.
2. **Not considering the minimum allowed height of the tree to cut.** This is another common mistake that can be made. Chef is not allowed to cut trees that are shorter than the minimum allowed height. To avoid this, it is important to check the height of each tree before cutting it.
3. **Using an incorrect data type to store the heights of the trees.** The heights of the trees can be very large, so it is important to use a data type that can store them accurately. A common mistake is to use a `int` data type, which can only store numbers up to a certain size. This can lead to incorrect results if the heights of the trees are larger than the maximum value that can be stored in an `int`.
4. **Not handling edge cases correctly.** There are a few edge cases that can occur when solving this problem. For example, what if there are no trees that are tall enough to cut? Or what if the order is for more wood than there are trees? It is important to handle these edge cases correctly to ensure that the program runs correctly.

**Additional tips:**

* When solving this problem, it is helpful to break it down into smaller steps. First, calculate the total height of the trees. Then, calculate the number of months needed to grow the trees to the required height. Finally, check if there are any trees that are tall enough to cut.
* It is also helpful to use a data structure to store the trees. This will make it easier to keep track of the heights of the trees and the amount of wood that is needed.
* When testing your program, it is important to test for a variety of different inputs. This will help you to identify any bugs that may be present in your code.

Title:
CODECHEF pree02

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of modulo operator**. The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. For example, 10 % 3 = 1. This means that 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.
2. **Incorrect use of the division operator**. The division operator (/) returns the quotient of a division. For example, 10 / 3 = 3. This means that 10 divided by 3 gives a quotient of 3.
3. **Incorrect use of the exponentiation operator**. The exponentiation operator (**) raises a number to a power. For example, 2 ** 3 = 8. This means that 2 raised to the power of 3 is 8.
4. **Incorrect use of the concatenation operator**. The concatenation operator (.) joins two strings together. For example, "hello" + "world" = "helloworld". This means that the strings "hello" and "world" are joined together to form the new string "helloworld".
5. **Incorrect use of the comparison operators**. The comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) compare two values. For example, 10 == 10 is true. This means that the values 10 and 10 are equal.
6. **Incorrect use of the logical operators**. The logical operators (&&, ||, !, ^, ~) combine the results of two or more logical expressions. For example, 10 < 10 && 10 > 10 is false. This means that the logical expressions 10 < 10 and 10 > 10 are both false.
7. **Incorrect use of the array indexing operator**. The array indexing operator ([]) accesses an element of an array. For example, arr[0] accesses the first element of the array arr.
8. **Incorrect use of the function call operator**. The function call operator (()) calls a function. For example, sum(arr) calls the sum function on the array arr.
9. **Incorrect use of the variable scope**. The scope of a variable determines where it can be used. For example, a variable declared inside a function can only be used inside that function.
10. **Incorrect use of the control flow statements**. The control flow statements (if, else, for, while, do-while) control the flow of execution of a program. For example, the if statement checks a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true.

Pain points:
The total tip money is 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 21.
 1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input variables are integers, but the developer may accidentally use a floating-point type. This will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator**. The developer may accidentally use the wrong comparison operator, such as `>` instead of `>=`. This will cause the program to output an incorrect answer.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may accidentally forget to add or subtract one when computing the answer. This will cause the program to output an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program, such as forgetting to consider all possible cases. This will cause the program to output an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect implementation**. The developer may make a mistake in the implementation of the program, such as using the wrong data structure or algorithm. This will cause the program to run slowly or crash.

CODEFORCES 1034_E. Little C Loves 3 III

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correct. For example, the input may contain spaces between the numbers, or the numbers may not be in the range [0,3].
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correct. For example, the output may contain spaces between the numbers, or the numbers may not be in the range [0,3].
* **Incorrect calculation of $c_i$:** The developer may incorrectly calculate $c_i$. For example, the developer may forget to take into account the condition that $j|k=i$ and $j\&k=0$.
* **Incorrect implementation of the bitwise operations:** The developer may incorrectly implement the bitwise operations $\texttt{|}$ and $\texttt{\&}$. For example, the developer may use the logical operators `||` and `&&` instead of the bitwise operators.
* **Incorrect use of the modulo operator:** The developer may incorrectly use the modulo operator. For example, the developer may use the modulo operator to calculate $c_i$, even though $c_i$ is not guaranteed to be less than or equal to 3.

**Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:**

* Carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand the input and output formats.
* Test your code on a few small examples to make sure it is working correctly.
* Use a debugger to help you track down any errors in your code.
* Make sure you are using the correct bitwise operators.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1057_B. DDoS

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specified in the problem statement is `n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) - number of seconds since server has been booted. The second line contains sequence of integers r_1, r_2, ..., r_n (0 ≤ r_i ≤ 5000), r_i - number of requests in the i-th second.` However, a developer may accidentally use a different format, such as `n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) - number of seconds since server has been booted. The second line contains sequence of integers r_1, r_2, ..., r_n (0 ≤ r_i ≤ 5000), r_i - number of requests in the i-th second.` This would cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the longest DDoS-attack.** The developer may incorrectly calculate the length of the longest DDoS-attack. For example, they may only consider the requests in the current second, or they may not take into account the fact that the total number of requests can exceed 100 * t. This would result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Off-by-one error.** The developer may make an off-by-one error when calculating the length of the longest DDoS-attack. For example, they may start counting the attack at the wrong time, or they may end counting the attack at the wrong time. This would result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Memory leak.** The developer may not properly free the memory allocated for the input data. This could lead to a memory leak, which could eventually cause the program to crash.
5. **Synchronization issues.** The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data between multiple threads. This could lead to data corruption or deadlocks.
6. **Security vulnerabilities.** The developer may introduce security vulnerabilities into the program by not properly validating user input or by failing to protect sensitive data.

**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect implementation of the graph traversal algorithm.** This could lead to the algorithm visiting some vertices more than once, which would result in an incorrect answer.
* **Incorrect calculation of the size of the connected component containing the chosen vertex.** This could lead to the algorithm overestimating the number of points that will be gained, which would also result in an incorrect answer.
* **Incorrect handling of the case where the tree has multiple connected components.** This could lead to the algorithm only considering one of the connected components, which would result in an incorrect answer.
* **Incorrect handling of the case where the tree is not acyclic.** This could lead to the algorithm getting stuck in an infinite loop, which would prevent it from finding an answer.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully implement the graph traversal algorithm and to correctly calculate the size of the connected component containing the chosen vertex.

# Problem: CODEFORCES 1223_G. Wooden Raft
# Difficulty: Medium

# Problem description:

"""
Suppose you are stuck on a desert island. The only way to save yourself is to craft a wooden raft and go to the sea. Fortunately, you have a hand-made saw and a forest nearby. Moreover, you've already cut several trees and prepared it to the point that now you have n logs and the i-th log has length a_i.

The wooden raft you'd like to build has the following structure: 2 logs of length x and x logs of length y. Such raft would have the area equal to x ⋅ y. Both x and y must be integers since it's the only way you can measure the lengths while being on a desert island. And both x and y must be at least 2 since the raft that is one log wide is unstable.

You can cut logs in pieces but you can't merge two logs in one. What is the maximum area of the raft you can craft?

Input

The first line contains the only integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of logs you have.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (2 ≤ a_i ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5) — the corresponding lengths of the logs.

It's guaranteed that you can always craft at least 2 × 2 raft.

Output

Print the only integer — the maximum area of the raft you can craft.

Examples

Input

9 10 9 18 9 9 9 28 9


Output


90

Note

In the first example, you can cut the log of the length 9 in 5 parts: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1. Now you can build 2 × 2 raft using 2 logs of length x = 2 and x = 2 logs of length y = 2.

In the second example, you can cut a_4 = 18 into two pieces 9 + 9 and a_8 = 28 in three pieces 10 + 9 + 9. Now you can make 10 × 9 raft using 2 logs of length 10 and 10 logs of length 9.

# Solution:

def main():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))

    res = 0

    for i in range(n):
        res = max(res, a[i] * 2)

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            res = max(res, (a[i] + a[j]) * 2)

    print(res)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Possible problems and bugs:

* The input format is not correct. For example, if the input is `1 9`, the program will throw an error because it expects the first line to contain an integer.
* The output format is not correct. For example, if the output is `4`, the program will throw an error because it expects the output to be an integer.
* The program does not handle the case where there are no logs. For example, if the input is `0`, the program will throw an error because it tries to access the first element of the array `a`.
* The program does not handle the case where all of the logs have the same length. For example, if the input is `10 10 10 10 10`, the program will output `100`, which is not the maximum possible area.
* The program does not handle the case where the logs are not sorted in ascending order. For example, if the input is `10 9 8 7 6`, the program will output `90`, which is not the maximum possible area.
* The program is inefficient. It takes O(n^2) time to run, where n is the number of logs.

To fix these problems, we can do the following:

* Check the input format and make sure that it is correct.
* Check the output format and make sure that it is correct.
* Handle the case where there are

Title:
CODEFORCES 128_D. Numbers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain an integer n, and the second line should contain the numbers separated by a space. However, a developer might accidentally forget to include the space between the numbers, or they might accidentally include an extra space. This would cause the program to fail to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the program should print a single line that says "YES" or "NO". However, a developer might accidentally print multiple lines, or they might print the output in the wrong format. This would cause the program to produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The program needs to check if it is possible to arrange the numbers in a circle so that any two neighboring numbers differ exactly by 1. To do this, the program needs to keep track of the current number and the previous number. If the current number is not 1 more than the previous number, then it is not possible to arrange the numbers in a circle.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** When checking if the current number is 1 more than the previous number, a developer might accidentally make an off-by-one error. This would cause the program to incorrectly determine that it is possible to arrange the numbers in a circle.
5. **Memory leaks.** The program needs to allocate memory for the numbers and the current and previous number. If the program does not free this memory when it is finished, it will cause a memory leak.
6. **Race conditions.** If multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is possible for a race condition to occur. This could cause the program to produce incorrect results or to crash.

2. **Off-by-one error.** The code below computes the number of possible grids by iterating over all possible values of `a_ij` from `L` to `R`, but it forgets to include the value `R` itself. This will result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect modulo arithmetic.** The code below uses the modulo operator (`%`) to compute the answer, but it does not take into account the fact that the answer may be negative. This will cause the answer to be incorrect if the input values are large.
4. **Incorrect use of the `pow()` function.** The code below uses the `pow()` function to compute the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements, but it does not take into account the fact that the answer may be greater than `2^63-1`. This will cause the code to overflow and crash.
5. **Incorrect use of the `gcd()` function.** The code below uses the `gcd()` function to compute the greatest common divisor of two numbers, but it does not take into account the fact that the numbers may be negative. This will cause the code to return an incorrect value.
6. **Incorrect use of the `modinv()` function.** The code below uses the `modinv()` function to compute the modular inverse of a number, but it does not take into account the fact that the number may not have a modular inverse. This will cause the code to return an incorrect value.
7. **Incorrect use of the `factorial()` function.** The code below uses the `factorial()` function to compute the factorial of a number, but it does not take into account the fact that the number may be negative. This will cause the code to overflow and crash.
8. **Incorrect use of the `binomial()` function.** The code below uses the `binomial()` function to compute the binomial coefficient of `n` choose `k`, but it does not take into account the fact that the answer may be greater than `2^63-1`. This will cause the code to overflow and crash.
9. **Incorrect use of the `combinations()` function.** The code below uses the `combinations()` function to compute the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements, but it does not take into account the fact that the answer may be greater than `2^63-1`. This will cause the code to overflow and crash.
10. **Incorrect use of the `permutations()` function.** The code below uses the `permutations()` function to compute the number of ways to permute a set of `n` elements, but it does not take into account the fact that the answer may be greater than `2^63-1`. This will cause the code to overflow and crash.

CODEFORCES 1438_A. Specific Tastes of Andre 

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer t, which is the number of test cases. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to read the input correctly and will produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that each test case should be output on a separate line, and that each line should contain a single perfect array of length n. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce the correct output.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program should be correct in order to produce the correct output. For example, the program should ensure that every nonempty subarray of the output array is good and that each element of the output array is less than or equal to 100.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors can occur when the program is counting or indexing elements in an array. For example, the program might accidentally count the first element of an array twice or forget to count the last element of an array.
5. **Memory errors**. The program should be careful not to allocate too much memory, as this could lead to the program crashing or running out of memory.
6. **Timeout errors**. The program should be careful not to run for too long, as this could lead to the program being timed out by the judge.
7. **Other errors**. There are many other possible errors that a developer could encounter when solving this problem. Some common examples include:
    * Using the wrong data type for a variable
    * Making a logical error in the code
    * Forgetting to close a file handle
    * Using an incorrect function call
    * Misspelling a variable name
    * Making a syntax error in the code

Title:
CODEFORCES 1487_G. String Counting

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data is given as integers, but the problem statement says that the answer should be modulo 998244353. This means that we need to use a data type that can store integers up to 998244353. The default data type for integers in Python is `int`, which can store integers up to 2**31-1. This is not enough for our problem, so we need to use a larger data type. We can use the `long` data type, which can store integers up to 2**63-1.

**2. Using incorrect modulo operator**

The problem statement says that the answer should be modulo 998244353. This means that we need to use the modulo operator (%) to calculate the answer. However, many developers forget to use the modulo operator, and this can lead to incorrect results.

**3. Using incorrect algorithm**

The problem can be solved using dynamic programming. However, many developers try to solve the problem using a brute-force algorithm, which is much slower.

**4. Not handling special cases**

The problem statement mentions a few special cases, such as the case where n is 3 or the case where all of the c_i values are equal. Developers should make sure to handle these special cases correctly.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is always important to test your code before submitting it to a competition. This will help you catch any bugs that you may have missed.

CODEFORCES 1511_D. Min Cost String

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not correct. For example, the input may contain non-integer values, or the number of integers may not be equal to 2.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not correct. For example, the output may contain characters that are not in the first k Latin letters, or the length of the output may not be equal to n.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the cost of a string.** The cost of a string is calculated incorrectly. For example, the cost may be calculated for a substring of the string, or the cost may be calculated for a string that does not contain only the first k Latin letters.
4. **Incorrect search for a string with minimum cost.** The search for a string with minimum cost is incorrect. For example, the search may not terminate, or the search may find a string that does not have minimum cost.
5. **Incorrect printing of the string with minimum cost.** The string with minimum cost is not printed correctly. For example, the string may be printed in the wrong order, or the string may be printed with extra spaces.

CODEFORCES 1539_B. Love Song

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input format is not specified clearly. Does the input contain only digits? Are there any spaces between the numbers?
* The output format is not specified clearly. Does the output contain only digits? Are there any spaces between the numbers?
* The problem statement is not clear. What does it mean to "repeat each letter in the subsegment k times"? Does k start from 1 or 0?
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input is invalid.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the output is too long.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the program runs out of memory.

Here are some possible solutions to these problems:

* The input format can be specified as follows:

```
n, q = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
s = input()
```

* The output format can be specified as follows:

```
for _ in range(q):
    l, r = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    print(len(s[l-1:r]))
```

* The problem statement can be clarified as follows:

```
Vasya repeats each letter in the subsegment k times, where k is the position of the letter in the alphabet. For example, if the question is about the substring "abbcb", then Vasya repeats letter 'a' once, each of the letters 'b' twice, letter 'c" three times, so that the resulting string is "abbbbcccbb", its length is 10.
```

* The problem statement can be modified to handle invalid input. For example, the following code will print an error message if the input is not a valid integer:

```
try:
    n = int(input())
except ValueError:
    print('Invalid input')
    exit(1)
```

* The problem statement can be modified to handle long output. For example, the following code will print the output in chunks of 100 characters:

```
for i in range(0, len(s), 100):
    print(s[i:i+100])
```

* The problem statement can be modified to handle out-of-memory errors. For example, the following code will use a fixed amount of memory, even if the input is very large:

```
s = ['a'] * 1000000000
```
Test inputs:
```

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input data correctly. One common mistake is to forget to read the document identifier, which is the first line of the input. Another common mistake is to read the document name into a variable that is too small, which will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output for this problem should be a single integer from 1 to 3, inclusive. It is important to make sure that you are formatting the output correctly. One common mistake is to output a string instead of an integer, or to output a number that is not in the correct range.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. There are a number of places in this problem where it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, when you are counting the number of lines in the document, or when you are indexing into the document text. It is important to be careful to check your work carefully to make sure that you don't make any mistakes.
4. **Memory errors**. This problem can be solved using a relatively small amount of memory. However, it is important to be careful not to allocate too much memory, or your program will crash. One common way to do this is to create a large array or string that you don't need.
5. **Time complexity**. The time complexity of this problem is O(n), where n is the number of lines in the document. It is important to make sure that your program runs in a reasonable amount of time, or it will not be able to solve the larger test cases.
6. **Space complexity**. The space complexity of this problem is O(n), where n is the number of lines in the document. It is important to make sure that your program doesn't use too much memory, or it will not be able to solve the larger test cases.
7. **Bugs in the training data**. The training data for this problem is not perfect. There are a few errors in the data that can cause your program to crash or give incorrect results. It is important to be aware of these errors and to handle them appropriately.
8. **Bugs in the test cases**. The test cases for this problem are not perfect. There are a few errors in the test cases that can cause your program to crash or give incorrect results. It is important to be aware of these errors and to handle them appropriately.

CODEFORCES 233_A. Perfect Permutation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that a single integer n should be given. However, the input may contain multiple integers, a string, or an empty line.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that n distinct integers from 1 to n should be printed, separated by whitespaces. However, the output may contain fewer than n integers, or the integers may not be from 1 to n, or the integers may not be separated by whitespaces.
3. **Off-by-one error.** The algorithm for finding a perfect permutation may be incorrect, and may return a permutation that is not perfect.
4. **Infinite loop.** The algorithm for finding a perfect permutation may enter an infinite loop.
5. **Stack overflow.** The algorithm for finding a perfect permutation may use too much stack space, and may cause a stack overflow.

Title:
CODEFORCES 258_E. Little Elephant and Tree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The data type of the input numbers is not always specified, so it is easy to make a mistake when converting them to the correct type. For example, if you try to convert a string to an integer, the program will crash.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When traversing a tree, it is easy to make an off-by-one error and miss a node or visit a node twice. This can lead to incorrect results.

**4. Memory leaks**

When allocating memory for a data structure, it is important to free it when you are finished with it. If you forget to free the memory, your program will eventually run out of memory and crash.

**5. Race conditions**

When multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is important to ensure that the data is accessed in a consistent manner. If you do not do this, your program may produce incorrect results or crash.

**6. Deadlocks**

When multiple threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, it is possible for them to deadlock. This means that the threads will be stuck waiting for each other forever, and your program will never terminate.

**7. Security vulnerabilities**

If you are not careful, your program may be vulnerable to security attacks. For example, if you allow users to input arbitrary data, they may be able to inject malicious code into your program.

Title:
CODEFORCES 281_E. Game on Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. The tree traversal algorithm must visit all nodes in the tree exactly once, and it must not visit any node more than once.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the expected number of steps.** The expected number of steps is the sum of the probabilities of each possible outcome, multiplied by the number of steps in that outcome. For example, if there is a 50% chance of taking one step and a 50% chance of taking two steps, then the expected number of steps is 1 * 0.5 + 2 * 0.5 = 1.5.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The tree traversal algorithm must be able to handle edge cases, such as a tree with only one node or a tree with no edges.
4. **Incorrect use of floating-point arithmetic.** Floating-point arithmetic is notoriously imprecise, so it is important to use it carefully when calculating the expected number of steps.
5. **Incorrect use of the memoization technique.** The memoization technique can be used to speed up the calculation of the expected number of steps, but it is important to use it correctly.

By following these tips, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving the CODEFORCES 281_E. Game on Tree problem.

CODEFORCES 330_E. Graph Reconstruction

Pain points:
1. The input graph may not be valid. For example, it may contain a self-loop or multiple edges between two nodes.
2. The new graph may not be unique. There may be multiple ways to construct a new graph that satisfies the given constraints.
3. The new graph may not be possible to construct. For example, if the input graph has a cycle of length 3, then it is not possible to construct a new graph that satisfies the given constraints.
4. The output format is not very clear. It is not clear whether the edges in the new graph should be listed in the same order as they appear in the input graph, or whether they can be listed in any order.
5. The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input graph is not valid. It is possible that the grader will accept a solution that does not construct a new graph, or that the grader will reject a solution that does construct a new graph.

Title:
CODEFORCES 352_C. Jeff and Rounding

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect rounding**. When rounding a number to the nearest integer, you need to round it to the nearest even integer if the number is halfway between two integers. For example, 3.5 should be rounded to 4, not 3.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating over an array, it's easy to make a mistake and miss one element or count one element twice. Be careful when using indexes in your code.
3. **Incorrect use of floating-point arithmetic**. Floating-point arithmetic is notoriously inaccurate, so you need to be careful when using it. For example, the following code will not produce the correct answer:
```
a = 0.1 + 0.2
b = 0.3 + 0.4
print(a - b)
```
The output of this code will be 0.0, even though the correct answer is 0.1. To avoid this problem, you can use the `round()` function to round floating-point numbers to the nearest integer.
4. **Incorrect use of the `min()` and `max()` functions**. The `min()` and `max()` functions return the smallest and largest element in a list, respectively. However, if two elements in the list are equal, the `min()` and `max()` functions will return the first element in the list. This can lead to incorrect results if you're not careful.
5. **Incorrect use of the `sum()` function**. The `sum()` function returns the sum of all the elements in a list. However, if the list is empty, the `sum()` function will return `0`. This can lead to incorrect results if you're not careful.
6. **Incorrect use of the `abs()` function**. The `abs()` function returns the absolute value of a number. This means that it returns the positive value of a number, even if the number is negative. This can lead to incorrect results if you're not careful.

Title:
CODEFORCES 376_D. Maximum Submatrix 2

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is two integers n and m, followed by n lines of m characters each. Each character must be either a 0 or a 1. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the maximum submatrix area**

The maximum submatrix area is the largest number of consecutive 1s in the matrix. To find this area, the program must first find all of the 1s in the matrix. Then, it must find the longest contiguous subsequence of 1s. The length of this subsequence is the maximum submatrix area.

**3. Overflow**

The maximum submatrix area can be very large, so the program must be careful to avoid overflow. One way to do this is to use 64-bit integers instead of 32-bit integers.

**4. Incorrect use of pointers**

The program must use pointers correctly to access the elements of the matrix. If the pointers are not used correctly, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect use of dynamic memory**

The program may need to allocate dynamic memory to store the elements of the matrix. If the memory is not allocated correctly, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

**6. Off-by-one errors**

The program must be careful to avoid off-by-one errors when calculating the indices of the elements of the matrix. If an off-by-one error occurs, the program may calculate the wrong submatrix area.

**7. Logical errors**

The program must be careful to avoid logical errors. For example, the program must not assume that the input is always valid. If a logical error occurs, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.
Test inputs:
1. Incorrect input format

```

CODEFORCES 447_E. DZY Loves Fibonacci Numbers

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the Fibonacci sequence**

The Fibonacci sequence is a recursive sequence, so it is important to implement it correctly. A common mistake is to forget to add the base cases (F1 = 1 and F2 = 1). Another common mistake is to use the wrong order of operations when computing the next term in the sequence.

**2. Incorrect handling of queries**

The queries in this problem can be either of two types: "1 l r" or "2 l r". It is important to correctly identify the type of each query and to process it accordingly. A common mistake is to process a "1 l r" query as a "2 l r" query, or vice versa.

**3. Incorrect handling of the modulo operation**

The output of the problem must be modulo 1000000009. A common mistake is to forget to apply the modulo operation when computing the output. Another common mistake is to use the wrong modulo operation.

**4. Incorrect input handling**

The input to the problem is a sequence of integers. It is important to correctly parse the input and to ensure that it is valid. A common mistake is to forget to check that the input is within the specified range.

**5. Incorrect output handling**

The output of the problem must be a single integer. It is important to correctly format the output and to ensure that it is within the specified range. A common mistake is to output multiple integers or to output a non-integer value.

CODEFORCES 46_A. Ball Game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The problem states that the number of kids in the circle is between 2 and 100, but the code below assumes that it is always 100. This could lead to an incorrect answer.
2. **Off-by-one error.** The code below correctly calculates the number of kids who will get the ball after each throw, but it prints one extra number at the end. This is because the loop iterates one extra time than it needs to.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The code below assumes that the kids are always standing in a circle, even if the number of kids is odd. This could lead to an incorrect answer.
4. **Use of global variables.** The code below uses the global variable `n` to store the number of kids in the circle. This is a bad practice because it makes the code more difficult to read and understand.
5. **Unnecessary complexity.** The code below uses a nested loop to calculate the number of kids who will get the ball after each throw. This is unnecessary because a single loop would suffice.
6. **Inefficient algorithm.** The code below uses a brute-force algorithm to calculate the number of kids who will get the ball after each throw. This is inefficient because it takes O(n^2) time to run.

Here is a revised version of the code that fixes these problems:

```
def get_ball_throwers(n):
  """
  Returns a list of the numbers of the kids who will get the ball after each throw.

  Args:
    n: The number of kids in the circle.

Title:
CODEFORCES 516_A. Drazil and Factorial

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined in the problem statement. A developer may incorrectly assume that the input will always be in the correct format, and may not handle invalid input correctly. This could lead to a variety of errors, such as a runtime error or a segmentation fault.

**2. Incorrect calculation of factorials**

The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to that number. A developer may incorrectly calculate the factorial of a number, leading to an incorrect answer. This could be caused by a variety of factors, such as using the wrong formula, or using a programming language that does not support factorials natively.

**3. Incorrect handling of leading zeroes**

The problem statement states that the input number may contain leading zeroes. A developer may incorrectly assume that the leading zeroes should be ignored when calculating the factorial, leading to an incorrect answer.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The problem statement states that the output should not contain any zeroes or ones. A developer may incorrectly output a number that contains these digits, leading to a incorrect answer. This could be caused by a variety of factors, such as using the wrong datatype, or using a programming language that does not support printing non-numeric characters.

Title:
CODEFORCES 543_A. Writing Code

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains four integers and n space-separated integers. If we use an integer array to store the n space-separated integers, we may get a runtime error because the input may contain more than 2^31 - 1 integers. To avoid this, we can use a vector to store the n space-separated integers.

**2. Using the wrong modulo**

The output should be a single integer modulo mod. If we do not use the modulo operator, the output may be incorrect.

**3. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can define a 2D array dp[i][j] to store the number of good plans with the first i programmers writing j lines of code. The following is the recursive formula for dp[i][j]:

```
dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - a[i]] (if j >= a[i])
dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] (otherwise)
```

We can then use the following code to solve the problem:

```
n, m, b, mod = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 1
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    for j in range(m + 1):
        if j >= a[i - 1]:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - a[i - 1]]
        else:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]

print(dp[n][m] % mod)
```

**4. Not handling corner cases**

The input may contain negative integers or zero. We need to handle these corner cases carefully.

CODEFORCES 56_C. Corporation Mail

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a comma inside a name, or a name may be too long.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output should be a single number. If the output is not a number, or if it contains more than one number, the solution will be incorrect.

**3. Incomplete solution**

The solution may not find all the uncomfortable situations. For example, the solution may only find the direct uncomfortable situations, but not the indirect ones.

**4. Incorrect time complexity**

The time complexity of the solution should be O(n), where n is the number of employees in the corporation. If the time complexity is too high, the solution will not be accepted by the judge.

**5. Incorrect space complexity**

The space complexity of the solution should be O(n), where n is the number of employees in the corporation. If the space complexity is too high, the solution will not be accepted by the judge.

**6. Memory leak**

The solution may leak memory. This can happen if the solution allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. Memory leaks can cause the solution to run out of memory and crash.

**7. Race condition**

The solution may suffer from a race condition. This can happen if the solution accesses shared data without synchronization. Race conditions can cause the solution to produce incorrect results.

**8. Deadlock**

The solution may deadlock. This can happen if the solution enters a situation where it is waiting for a resource that is never released. Deadlocks can cause the solution to hang indefinitely.

CODEFORCES 591_A. Wizards' Duel

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The input is given as integers, but the code is using floats. This will cause errors when computing the distance between the two wizards.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the distance.** The distance between the two wizards is not simply the sum of their speeds. The impulses will travel at different speeds, and they will also collide and turn around. The correct calculation of the distance is more complex.
3. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single real number, but the code is printing a string. This will cause the checker to fail.
4. **Incorrect error handling.** The code should handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input is invalid, the code should print an error message and exit.
5. **Inefficient code.** The code can be made more efficient by using some of the built-in functions of the programming language. For example, the `math.sqrt()` function can be used to calculate the square root.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```
import math


def main():
    l = int(input())
    p = int(input())
    q = int(input())

    t1 = l / p

Title:
CODEFORCES 612_E. Square Root of Permutation

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains integers from 1 to n, so we need to use an integer data type to store them. If we use a floating-point data type, we may get incorrect results.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem is about finding a permutation q such that q2 = p. We can use the following algorithm:

1. Initialize a permutation q to be the identity permutation (i.e., q[i] = i for all i).
2. Iterate over the elements of p. For each element p[i], swap q[i] and q[p[i]].
3. If q2 = p, then we have found a solution. Otherwise, go back to step 2.

This algorithm is correct, but it is inefficient. A better algorithm is to use the following property:

If q2 = p, then q[i] = p[p[i]] for all i.

This means that we can find q by first finding p2 and then applying the inverse permutation to it.

**3. Not handling the corner cases**

The problem statement specifies that n must be between 1 and 106. If n is less than 1 or greater than 106, then the problem is not well-defined and we should return an error.

**4. Using incorrect variable names**

The problem statement uses the following variable names:

* n: the number of elements in permutation p
* p: the elements of permutation p
* q: the permutation that we are trying to find

We should use these same variable names in our code to avoid confusion.

**5. Not commenting your code**

It is important to comment your code so that other people can understand what it does. This is especially important for code that is complex or difficult to understand.
Test inputs:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

```
n = int(input())
p = list(map(int, input().split()))

# This will cause an error because the elements of p are integers, but we are trying to store them in a list of floats.
q = [float(i) for i in p]
```

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

```
n = int(input())
p = list(map(int, input().split()))

# This algorithm is correct, but it is inefficient.
q = [i for i in range(n)]
for i in range(n):
    q[i], q[p[i]] = q[p[i]], q[i]

if q == p:
    print(*q)
else:
    print(-1)
```

**3. Not handling the corner cases**

```
n = int(input())
p = list(map(int, input().split()))

# This will cause an error because n is less than 1.
if n < 1:
    raise ValueError("n must be at least 1")

# This will cause an error because n is greater than 106.
if n > 106:
    raise ValueError("n must be at most 106")
```

**4. Using incorrect variable names**

```
n = int(input())
p = list(map(int, input().split()))

# These variable names are incorrect because they do not match the variable names used in the problem statement.
q = p2
p2 = p

print(*q)
```

**5. Not commenting your code**

```
n = int(input())
p = list(map(int, input().split()))

# This code is not commented, so it is difficult to understand what it does.
q = [i for i in range(n)]
for i in range(n):
    q[i], q[p[i]] = q[p[i]], q[i]

Title:
CODEFORCES 632_E. Thief in a Shop

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct.**

The input format is "n k", where `n` is the number of kinds of products and `k` is the number of products the thief will take. However, the input may contain other characters, such as spaces or newlines. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**2. The output format is not correct.**

The output should be a list of all the possible total costs of stolen products, separated by a space. However, the output may contain other characters, such as newlines or commas. This can make it difficult to read the output and identify the correct answer.

**3. The program does not account for all possible cases.**

The program may only work for a specific set of input values. For example, the program may only work for input values where `n` is less than or equal to `k`. If the input values do not meet these criteria, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

**4. The program is not efficient.**

The program may take a long time to run, especially for large input values. This can be a problem if the program is running on a slow computer or if the input values are very large.

**5. The program is not robust.**

The program may not be able to handle unexpected input values. For example, the program may crash if the input values are invalid or if the input format is incorrect. This can be a problem if the program is used in a production environment.

To avoid these problems, it is important to test the program thoroughly with a variety of input values. The program should also be documented so that other developers can understand how it works.

Title:
CODEFORCES 661_B. Seasons

Pain points:
**1. The input may not be a valid month name.** For example, the input could be "Februaryr" or "12". The developer should check that the input is a valid month name before trying to process it.
2. The developer may not correctly identify the season of the month. For example, the developer may incorrectly identify March as a summer month or November as a spring month. The developer should carefully check the range of months for each season and make sure that they are correct.
3. The developer may not output the season in the correct format. The output should be a single string, and the season should be lowercase. The developer should make sure that the output meets these requirements.
4. The developer may not handle invalid input gracefully. For example, if the input is not a valid month name, the developer should print an error message or return an appropriate error code. The developer should make sure that the program handles invalid input in a way that is consistent with the problem statement.

Title:
CODEFORCES 685_B. Kay and Snowflake

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the centroid finding algorithm.**

The centroid of a tree (or a subtree) is a node, such that if we erase it from the tree, the maximum size of the connected component will be at least two times smaller than the size of the initial tree (or a subtree). A simple but inefficient algorithm for finding the centroid of a tree is to start at the root node and recursively find the centroid of each subtree. The centroid of the entire tree is then the node whose subtree has the smallest size. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

A more efficient algorithm for finding the centroid of a tree is to use a bottom-up approach. We start by finding the size of each subtree. We then find the node whose subtree has the median size. This node is the centroid of the tree. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n).

**2. Incorrect implementation of the dfs traversal.**

The dfs traversal is a recursive algorithm for traversing a tree. It starts at the root node and recursively visits each of the node's children. The dfs traversal is used to find the depth of a node in a tree, the number of nodes in a subtree, and the centroid of a tree.

A common mistake when implementing the dfs traversal is to forget to mark the nodes as visited as you go. This can lead to incorrect results, such as counting the same node multiple times or missing nodes entirely.

To avoid this mistake, you should always mark the nodes as visited as you visit them. You can do this by setting a boolean flag to true when you visit a node.

**3. Incorrect implementation of the union-find data structure.**

The union-find data structure is a data structure used to track the connected components of a graph. It consists of a set of disjoint sets, where each set represents a connected component of the graph. The union-find data structure supports two operations: union and find. The union operation merges two sets into one, and the find operation returns the representative element of a set.

A common mistake when implementing the union-find data structure is to forget to check for cycles when merging two sets. This can lead to incorrect results, such as merging two sets that are not connected or creating a cycle in the graph.

To avoid this mistake, you should always check for cycles before merging two sets. You can do this by using a topological sort to find the order in which the sets should be merged.

**4. Incorrect implementation of the binary search algorithm.**

The binary search algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the array in half until the element is found.

A common mistake when implementing the binary search algorithm is to forget to check for the base case. The base case occurs when the array is empty or the element is not in the array.

To avoid this mistake, you should always check for the base case before performing any recursive calls. You can do this by checking if the array is empty or if the element is not in the array.

**5. Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm.**

A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that makes locally optimal choices at each step in the hope of finding a globally optimal solution. Greedy algorithms are often used to solve problems where the optimal solution can be found by iteratively making a sequence of decisions that are locally optimal.

A common mistake when implementing a greedy algorithm is to make decisions that are not locally optimal. This can lead to incorrect results or inefficient solutions.

To avoid this mistake, you should always make sure that the decisions you make are locally optimal. You can do this by carefully examining the problem and identifying the decisions that will lead to the best possible outcome.

Title:
CODEFORCES 72_G. Fibonacci army

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Fibonacci sequence.** The Fibonacci sequence is a recursive sequence, so it is important to make sure that the base cases are handled correctly. In this problem, the base cases are f0 = f1 = 1.
2. **Off-by-one error.** When computing the Fibonacci numbers, it is important to make sure that the index is correct. In this problem, the index starts at 1, so the first Fibonacci number is f1 = 1.
3. **Incorrect use of floating-point arithmetic.** The Fibonacci numbers can be very large, so it is important to use integer arithmetic when computing them. In this problem, the Fibonacci numbers are limited to 20, so integer arithmetic is sufficient.
4. **Incorrect use of dynamic memory allocation.** The Fibonacci numbers can grow very quickly, so it is important to use dynamic memory allocation when computing them. In this problem, the Fibonacci numbers are limited to 20, so a fixed-size array is sufficient.
5. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The Fibonacci numbers can be very large, so it is important to make sure that the calculations do not overflow. In this problem, the Fibonacci numbers are limited to 20, so overflow is not a concern.

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** This is the most common problem that developers encounter when solving problems. It can happen for a variety of reasons, such as a mistake in the logic of the algorithm, a typo, or an incorrect use of a data structure.
* **Incorrect input.** The input data may be incorrect in a number of ways. For example, it may contain invalid characters, it may not be the correct format, or it may be missing some of the required data.
* **Incorrect output.** The output of the program may be incorrect for a variety of reasons. For example, it may contain invalid characters, it may not be the correct format, or it may not contain all of the required data.
* **Memory leaks.** A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
* **Stack overflow.** A stack overflow occurs when a program calls a function so many times that it runs out of stack space. This can also lead to the program crashing.
* **Race conditions.** A race condition occurs when two or more parts of a program access the same data at the same time and the result depends on the order in which they access the data. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results or even crashing.
* **Deadlocks.** A deadlock occurs when two or more parts of a program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish because it is waiting for the other one. This can lead to the program being stuck in an infinite loop.
* **Uncaught exceptions.** An uncaught exception occurs when a program encounters an error that it cannot handle. This can lead to the program crashing or behaving in an unexpected way.

The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain a number that is too large, or it may not contain the correct number of lines. This can cause the program to crash or to output incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also important. The program should output the correct answer in the correct format. For example, the output should be a single number, and it should not contain any spaces or other characters.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. This can cause the program to output incorrect results or to take a long time to run.

**4. Incorrect data structures**

The data structures used to store the input data and the output results may be incorrect. This can cause the program to run slowly or to output incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect error handling**

The program should handle errors correctly. For example, if the input file does not exist, the program should print an error message and exit.

**6. Incorrect testing**

The program should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly. This includes testing the program with different input data and different output formats.

**7. Incorrect documentation**

The program should be well-documented so that other developers can understand how it works. This includes providing a description of the problem that the program solves, a description of the algorithm used to solve the problem, and a description of the data structures used to store the input data and the output results.

CODEFORCES 799_B. T-shirt buying

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input format is `n p1 p2 ... pn`, but the input is `n p1 p2 ...`, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program. For example, if the output format is `m p1 p2 ... pm`, but the output is `m p1 p2 ... pm x`, the program may crash.
3. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input and output is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input is a list of integers, but the program expects a list of strings, the program may crash.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program is not correct, which may lead to errors in the output. For example, if the program is supposed to find the minimum value in a list, but it returns the maximum value instead, the program is incorrect.
5. **Memory leak**. The program may not release the memory it has allocated, which may lead to a memory leak. This can cause the program to crash or run slowly.
6. **Race condition**. The program may not be thread-safe, which may lead to errors in the output. For example, if two threads are trying to access the same variable at the same time, the program may crash.
7. **Deadlock**. The program may deadlock, which means that it will stop running and wait for an event that will never happen. This can cause the program to crash or run slowly.
8. **Buffer overflow**. The program may overflow a buffer, which means that it will write data to a memory location that is not intended for it. This can cause the program to crash or run slowly.
9. **Format string vulnerability**. The program may be vulnerable to a format string vulnerability, which means that it can be tricked into executing arbitrary code. This can be very dangerous, as it can allow an attacker to take control of the program.
10. **SQL injection vulnerability**. The program may be vulnerable to a SQL injection vulnerability, which means that it can be tricked into executing arbitrary SQL code. This can allow an attacker to access sensitive data or even take control of the database.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain a non-integer number, or it may not contain the correct number of lines. The developer should check the input format and handle any errors gracefully.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correctly followed. For example, the output may contain the wrong number of lines, or it may not contain the correct values. The developer should check the output format and handle any errors gracefully.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**. The developer may implement the algorithm incorrectly, resulting in incorrect output. For example, the developer may not correctly handle all of the edge cases, or they may make a mistake in their calculations. The developer should carefully test their implementation to ensure that it is correct.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer may not correctly free up memory that is allocated during the execution of the program. This can lead to memory leaks, which can eventually cause the program to crash. The developer should carefully manage their memory usage to avoid memory leaks.
5. **Synchronization issues**. The developer may not correctly synchronize access to shared data between multiple threads. This can lead to data corruption and incorrect results. The developer should use appropriate synchronization mechanisms to ensure that shared data is accessed correctly.
6. **Race conditions**. The developer may not correctly handle race conditions between multiple threads. This can lead to incorrect results or even a program crash. The developer should carefully design their code to avoid race conditions.
7. **Deadlocks**. The developer may not correctly handle deadlocks between multiple threads. This can lead to a program deadlock, which can prevent the program from making any progress. The developer should carefully design their code to avoid deadlocks.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer may introduce security vulnerabilities into their code. This can allow attackers to exploit the program to gain unauthorized access to the system. The developer should carefully design their code to avoid security vulnerabilities.

Title:
CODEFORCES 865_B. Ordering Pizza

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data contains integers, so you should use the `int` data type to store them. If you use a floating-point data type, such as `float` or `double`, you may lose precision and get incorrect results.

**2. Not initializing variables**

When you declare a variable, you should always initialize it with a value. If you don't initialize a variable, it will be initialized with a default value, which may be incorrect. For example, the default value for an `int` variable is `0`, so if you don't initialize an `int` variable, it will be initialized to `0`. This could lead to incorrect results if you use the variable in a calculation.

**3. Using the wrong operator**

The problem statement specifies that the number of slices per pizza is `S`. So, if you want to calculate the number of pizzas you need to buy, you need to divide the total number of slices by `S`. However, if you accidentally use the multiplication operator (`*`) instead of the division operator (`/`), you will get the wrong answer.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

When you're iterating over a list or an array, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, if you're trying to iterate over a list of 10 elements, you might accidentally start at index `0` and end at index `9`, which would skip the last element. This could lead to incorrect results.

**5. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem statement asks you to find the maximum possible total happiness that can be achieved. There are a few different ways to solve this problem, but not all of them are efficient. For example, you could try to brute-force the problem by trying every possible combination of pizzas, but this would be very time-consuming. A more efficient approach would be to use dynamic programming.

CODEFORCES 891_B. Gluttony

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as expected. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or the number of elements in the array may not be as expected.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as expected. For example, the output may not contain the correct number of elements, or the elements may not be separated by spaces.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the logic may not consider all possible cases, or it may make incorrect assumptions about the input data.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The logic may be correct, but it may be off by one in its calculations. For example, the logic may count the number of elements in a set incorrectly, or it may add or subtract the wrong numbers.
5. **Memory errors**. The logic may use too much memory, which can lead to the program crashing or running out of memory.
6. **Time errors**. The logic may take too long to run, which can lead to the program timing out or the user becoming impatient.
7. **Inefficient code**. The logic may be inefficient, which can lead to the program running slowly or using too much memory.
8. **Bugs**. The logic may contain bugs, which can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

CODEFORCES 913_E. Logical Expression

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of logical operators**. For example, using `&&` instead of `&`, or using `||` instead of `|`.
2. **Incorrect use of parentheses**. For example, forgetting to close a parenthesis, or using parentheses incorrectly.
3. **Incorrect use of variables**. For example, using a variable that has not been defined, or using a variable in the wrong place.
4. **Incorrect use of the truth table**. For example, misinterpreting the truth table, or using the truth table incorrectly.
5. **Other errors**. For example, typos, or using the wrong algorithm.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

1. **Be careful when using logical operators**. Make sure you understand the difference between `&&`, `&`, `||`, and `|`.
2. **Use parentheses carefully**. Parentheses can help to clarify the order of operations, and can prevent errors.
3. **Use variables correctly**. Only use variables that have been defined, and use them in the correct place.
4. **Understand the truth table**. Make sure you understand how the truth table works, and how to use it to find the correct expression.
5. **Use the right algorithm**. There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. Make sure you use the right one for your particular situation.

Title:
CODEFORCES 935_E. Fafa and Ancient Mathematics

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a space between two numbers, the program may interpret the space as a delimiter and read the two numbers as separate inputs. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect operator precedence**. The order in which operators are evaluated can affect the outcome of a calculation. For example, in the expression `1 + 2 * 3`, the multiplication operator is evaluated before the addition operator, so the result is `7`. However, if the order of the operators is reversed, the result is `9`. It is important to be aware of the operator precedence when writing arithmetic expressions, as it can make a big difference in the outcome.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when a programmer forgets to include or exclude an element from a calculation. For example, if a programmer is counting the number of items in a list, they may accidentally count one item too many or one item too few. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Array indexing errors**. Array indexing errors occur when a programmer attempts to access an element of an array that does not exist. For example, if a programmer tries to access the third element of an array that only has two elements, the program will crash.
5. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when a programmer allocates memory for a variable but does not free it when the variable is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Infinite loops**. Infinite loops occur when a program enters a loop that never terminates. This can happen if the loop condition is always true or if the loop body contains a call to a function that itself contains a loop. Infinite loops can cause programs to run for a long time or to crash.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may not contain two space-separated integers, or it may not contain exactly n rows of m characters.
3. **Incorrect solution**. The solution may not satisfy the constraints of the problem. For example, the number of connected components of each type of flower may not be equal to the corresponding input value.
4. **Memory limit exceeded**. The solution may use too much memory. This can happen if the solution creates a large data structure, or if the solution does not free up memory that is no longer needed.

HACKEREARTH car-parking-4

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly identifying the start and end of the street.** The street is represented as a string, where each character describes a section of the street 5 meters in length. So the first character describes the first 5 meters of the street, the second character describes the next 5 meters and so on. However, it is possible to incorrectly identify the start and end of the street, which would result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Not considering all of the possible parking spaces.** The problem states that you can park at any position that meets the following requirements:
    * It is not directly in front of a private driveway.
    * It is not directly in front of a bus stop.
    * It is not 5 meters before a bus stop.
    * It is not 10 meters before a bus stop.
    * It is not directly in front of a side-street.
    * It is not 5 meters before a side-street.
    * It is not 5 meters after a side-street.
However, it is possible to miss some of these possible parking spaces, which would result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrectly counting the number of possible parking spaces.** Even if you correctly identify the start and end of the street and correctly consider all of the possible parking spaces, it is still possible to incorrectly count the number of possible parking spaces. This could happen if you accidentally double-count some parking spaces or if you forget to count some parking spaces.
4. **Using incorrect data types.** The problem states that the street will be represented as a string. However, it is possible to use an incorrect data type for the street, which could result in an incorrect answer.
5. **Using incorrect logic.** The problem requires you to use logic to solve the problem. However, it is possible to use incorrect logic, which would result in an incorrect answer.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and to correctly identify the start and end of the street. You should also carefully consider all of the possible parking spaces and correctly count the number of possible parking spaces. Finally, you should use the correct data types and logic to solve the problem.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain a negative integer, or a string instead of an integer. The developer should check the input format and raise an error if it is incorrect.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correct. For example, the output may contain a negative integer, or a string instead of an integer. The developer should check the output format and raise an error if it is incorrect.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the developer may use a brute-force algorithm that is too slow, or the developer may use an algorithm that does not correctly answer all of the queries. The developer should carefully design and implement an algorithm that is correct and efficient.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer may not properly release memory that is allocated during the execution of the program. This can lead to memory leaks, which can eventually cause the program to crash. The developer should carefully manage memory to avoid memory leaks.
5. **Synchronization issues**. The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data between multiple threads. This can lead to race conditions, which can cause the program to produce incorrect results or to crash. The developer should carefully synchronize access to shared data to avoid synchronization issues.
6. **Deadlocks**. The developer may create deadlocks in the program. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, and no thread can proceed. The developer should carefully design the program to avoid deadlocks.

HACKEREARTH gcd-game-11

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable names**. The variable names "a" and "b" are used for both Arjit's and Chandu Don's bullets, which could lead to confusion.
2. **Incorrect logic**. The code does not correctly handle the case where GCD(a, b) is equal to 1. In this case, the player should only be able to subtract 1 from the opposite player's bullets, but the code allows them to divide the number of bullets by GCD(a, b) as well.
3. **Incorrect output**. The code does not correctly handle the case where both players end up with 1 bullet. In this case, the output should be "Draw", but the code instead prints the name of the player who made the last move.
4. **Inefficient code**. The code could be made more efficient by using a more efficient algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers.
5. **Unclear code**. The code is not very clear, and it could be improved by adding more comments and explaining the logic in more detail.

Here are some suggestions for how to fix these problems:

1. **Use more descriptive variable names**. The variable names "a" and "b" could be replaced with more descriptive names, such as "ArjitBullets" and "ChanduBullets".
2. **Correct the logic**. The code should be modified to correctly handle the case where GCD(a, b) is equal to 1. In this case, the player should only be able to subtract 1 from the opposite player's bullets.
3. **Correct the output**. The code should be modified to correctly handle the case where both players end up with 1 bullet. In this case, the output should be "Draw".
4. **Optimize the code**. The code could be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers.

HACKEREARTH largest-volume-84

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect type casting**. The input is given as two integers, but the formula for the volume of a truncated cone requires the radius and slant height to be floats. If the developer does not cast the input values to floats, the volume will be calculated incorrectly.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the slant height**. The slant height of a truncated cone is not the same as the distance between the two bases. The slant height is the shortest possible distance between the edges of the two bases, and it can be calculated using the following formula:

```
s = √(r² + h²)
```

where r is the radius of the lower base and h is the height of the truncated cone.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the volume**. The volume of a truncated cone is given by the following formula:

```
V = πr²h/3
```

where r is the radius of the lower base, h is the height of the truncated cone, and π is the mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. When calculating the volume of a truncated cone, it is important to make sure that the radius and slant height are both measured in the same units. If the radius is measured in meters and the slant height is measured in centimeters, the volume will be calculated incorrectly.
5. **Floating-point errors**. When calculating the volume of a truncated cone, it is important to be aware of the potential for floating-point errors. Floating-point numbers are not exact representations of real numbers, and they can sometimes lead to rounding errors. To avoid these errors, it is important to use a high-precision floating-point library.
6. **Infinite loops**. The code for calculating the volume of a truncated cone could potentially enter an infinite loop if the radius or slant height is negative. To avoid this problem, the developer should check the input values for validity before performing any calculations.

3. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may not be in the correct data type. For example, the input may contain a string instead of an integer. The developer should check the data type of the input carefully and convert it to the correct data type if necessary.
4. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the developer may use a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem, which can be very inefficient. The developer should use a more efficient algorithm to solve the problem.
5. **Incorrect implementation**. The developer may implement the algorithm incorrectly. For example, the developer may have a bug in their code that causes the algorithm to not work correctly. The developer should carefully debug their code to find and fix any bugs.

Title:
HACKEREARTH perfect-square-5

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of `pow()` function.** The `pow()` function in Python takes two arguments: the base and the exponent. In this problem, we need to find the square root of a number, which is the same as raising the number to the power of 0.5. So, we should use the following code:

```python
num = int(input())
sqrt_num = pow(num, 0.5)
```

2. **Using the wrong data type.** The numbers in this problem are very large, so we need to use a data type that can store them accurately. The `int` data type is not large enough, so we should use the `long` data type instead.

3. **Using an incorrect comparison operator.** The problem asks us to print `YES` if the number is a perfect square, and to print the minimum value that must be added or subtracted to make it a perfect square if it is not. We can use the following code to check if a number is a perfect square:

```python
num = int(input())
sqrt_num = pow(num, 0.5)
if sqrt_num == int(sqrt_num):
    print("YES")
else:
    print(int(sqrt_num) - num)
```

4. **Using an incorrect loop condition.** The problem asks us to print the minimum value that must be added or subtracted to make the number a perfect square. We can use the following code to find this value:

```python
num = int(input())
sqrt_num = pow(num, 0.5)
diff = int(sqrt_num) - num
if diff < 0:
    diff = -diff
print(diff)
```

5. **Not handling the edge cases.** The problem does not specify what to do if the number is 0 or 1. We can handle these edge cases by adding the following code to our solution:

```python
if num == 0 or num == 1:
    print("YES")
```

Title:
HACKEREARTH roy-and-matrix-sum-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of data types.** The problem states that we need to use a 64-bit integer to avoid overflow. However, many developers may accidentally use a smaller data type, which would lead to incorrect results.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** The problem states that the matrix is NxN, but many developers may accidentally create a matrix that is N+1xN+1. This would lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect looping logic.** The problem states that we need to sum the values in each row and column of the matrix. However, many developers may accidentally sum the values in each element of the matrix. This would lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect use of mathematical operators.** The problem states that we need to calculate the absolute value of the difference between i and j. However, many developers may accidentally calculate the value of i-j. This would lead to incorrect results.
5. **Failure to handle edge cases.** The problem states that the matrix is NxN, but many developers may accidentally try to access elements outside of the matrix. This would lead to incorrect results or a runtime error.

Title:
HACKEREARTH vaishnav-and-factorials

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect factorial calculation**. The factorial of a number is the product of all the whole numbers from 1 to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 120 because 120 = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5. If a developer incorrectly calculates the factorial of a number, the output of the program will be incorrect.
2. **Incorrect lucky number counting**. The lucky numbers are 4 and 7. To count the number of lucky numbers in the factorial of a number, the developer needs to iterate through the factorial and check if each number is a lucky number. If a number is a lucky number, the developer should increment a counter. The output of the program should be the value of the counter.
3. **Incorrect input handling**. The input to the program is a single integer that represents the number of test cases. The developer needs to read the input and store it in a variable. The developer should then iterate through the test cases and call the factorial calculation function for each test case.
4. **Incorrect output handling**. The output of the program should be a single integer that represents the number of lucky numbers in the factorial of the number. The developer should print the output to the console.
5. **Incorrect error handling**. The developer should handle any errors that occur during the execution of the program. For example, if the user enters an invalid input, the developer should print an error message and exit the program.

ATCODER p02865 NIKKEI Programming Contest 2019-2 - Sum of Two Integers

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong formula**

The formula for the number of ways to choose two distinct positive integers totaling N is:

```
C(N - 1, 1) + C(N - 2, 2)
```

However, some developers may mistakenly use the formula for the number of ways to choose two positive integers from a set of size N:

```
C(N, 2)
```

This will result in an incorrect answer.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

Another common mistake is to use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. One common incorrect algorithm is to iterate over all possible pairs of positive integers and check if they total N. This algorithm is inefficient, as it will iterate over many pairs of integers that do not total N.

A more efficient algorithm is to use the following steps:

1. Find the largest integer that is less than or equal to N / 2.
2. Subtract this integer from N to get the other integer in the pair.
3. Multiply the number of ways to choose the first integer by the number of ways to choose the second integer.

This algorithm will run in O(log N) time.

**3. Using incorrect data types**

Some developers may use incorrect data types to store the integers N and the two integers in the pair. This can lead to errors, such as overflows or incorrect results.

It is important to use the correct data types to store these values, such as `int` for integers and `long long` for very large integers.

**4. Not handling special cases correctly**

Some developers may not handle special cases correctly, such as when N is equal to 1 or 2. This can lead to errors, such as incorrect results or runtime errors.

It is important to handle special cases correctly, such as by checking if N is equal to 1 or 2 before using the formula to calculate the number of ways to choose two distinct positive integers totaling N.

2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may not be in the correct data type. For example, the first line may contain strings instead of integers, or the second line may contain floating-point numbers instead of integers.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may accidentally count one bounce too many or too few. This can happen if the developer does not correctly account for the first bounce, or if the developer does not correctly account for the fact that the ball may bounce more than once at the same coordinate.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may implement the incorrect algorithm for solving the problem. This can happen if the developer does not correctly account for all of the possible cases, or if the developer makes a mistake in their calculations.
5. **Runtime error**. The developer's code may not run correctly due to a variety of reasons. For example, the code may contain a syntax error, or it may run out of memory.
6. **Memory leak**. The developer's code may leak memory, which can eventually cause the program to crash. This can happen if the developer does not correctly free up memory that is no longer needed.
7. **Security vulnerability**. The developer's code may contain a security vulnerability, which could allow an attacker to exploit the program. This can happen if the developer does not correctly validate input data, or if the developer uses insecure programming practices.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully follow the input format, use the correct data types, and carefully test their code. They should also be aware of the potential for off-by-one errors, incorrect logic, runtime errors, memory leaks, and security vulnerabilities.

```
N
A_1 B_1
:
A_N B_N
```

However, the output format is given as follows:

```
the sum of the happiness Takahashi earns in the end" minus "the sum of the happiness Aoki earns in the end"
```

This mismatch can cause the program to output the wrong answer.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the sum of the happiness Takahashi earns in the end**

The sum of the happiness Takahashi earns in the end is calculated as follows:

```
Takahashi_happiness = A_1 + A_3 + A_5 + ...
```

However, the program may incorrectly calculate the sum of the happiness Takahashi earns in the end as follows:

```
Takahashi_happiness = A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + ...
```

This incorrect calculation can cause the program to output the wrong answer.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the sum of the happiness Aoki earns in the end**

The sum of the happiness Aoki earns in the end is calculated as follows:

```
Aoki_happiness = B_2 + B_4 + B_6 + ...
```

However, the program may incorrectly calculate the sum of the happiness Aoki earns in the end as follows:

```
Aoki_happiness = B_1 + B_2 + B_3 + ...
```

This incorrect calculation can cause the program to output the wrong answer.

**4. Incorrect calculation of the difference between the sum of the happiness Takahashi earns in the end and the sum of the happiness Aoki earns in the end**

The difference between the sum of the happiness Takahashi earns in the end and the sum of the happiness Aoki earns in the end is calculated as follows:

```
Takahashi_happiness - Aoki_happiness
```

However, the program may incorrectly calculate the difference as follows:

```
Takahashi_happiness + Aoki_happiness
```

This incorrect calculation can cause the program to output the wrong answer.

ATCODER p03922 CODE FESTIVAL 2016 Final (Parallel) - Pair Cards

Pain points:
**1. M is not a factor of all X_i**

If M is not a factor of all X_i, then it is impossible to create any pairs of cards whose sum is a multiple of M. In this case, the answer is 0.

**2. M is a factor of all X_i**

If M is a factor of all X_i, then we can create as many pairs of cards as possible by grouping the cards into pairs whose sum is a multiple of M. The number of pairs that can be created is equal to the number of distinct multiples of M that are less than or equal to the maximum value of X_i.

**3. M is not a prime number**

If M is not a prime number, then it is possible to create pairs of cards whose sum is a multiple of M without grouping the cards into pairs. For example, if M = 6, then we can create a pair of cards whose sum is 6 by taking a card with value 3 and a card with value 3. In this case, the answer is not equal to the number of distinct multiples of M that are less than or equal to the maximum value of X_i.

**4. The input data is invalid**

The input data may be invalid in several ways. For example, the number of cards N may be less than 2, the value of M may be less than 1, or the values of X_i may be greater than 10^5. In these cases, the answer is undefined.

Title:
AIZU p00023 Circles Intersection

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong formula to calculate the distance between two points.** The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the formula $\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}$. However, some developers may accidentally use the formula $\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 - (y_1 - y_2)^2}$, which will give the wrong answer.
2. **Not taking into account the possibility that the two circles are concentric.** If the two circles are concentric, then their distance will be zero, and the formula for calculating the intersection will not work.
3. **Using the wrong formula to calculate the intersection of two circles.** The intersection of two circles is given by the formula

$$
(x, y) = \left( \frac{r_1^2 - r_2^2 + d^2}{2d}, \frac{-2r_1r_2}{d} \right)
$$

where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the radii of the two circles, and $d$ is the distance between their centers. However, some developers may accidentally use the formula

$$
(x, y) = \left( \frac{r_1^2 - r_2^2 - d^2}{2d}, \frac{-2r_1r_2}{d} \right)
$$

which will give the wrong answer.
4. **Not handling the case where the two circles do not intersect.** If the two circles do not intersect, then the intersection formula will return an empty set. Some developers may not handle this case correctly, and their program may crash or give an incorrect answer.
5. **Using floating-point numbers incorrectly.** Floating-point numbers are not exact, and they can be rounded off to the wrong value. This can lead to errors in the intersection calculation.
6. **Not using the right data types.** The data types used to store the coordinates of the circles and the distance between them must be large enough to avoid overflow errors.
7. **Not using the right algorithm.** The intersection of two circles can be calculated using a variety of algorithms. Some algorithms are more efficient than others, and some are more accurate than others. The developer must choose the right algorithm for the given problem.

Title:
AIZU p00311 Fishing Competition

Pain points:
### 1. Input Format Error

The input format is not correct. For example, if the number of chars or yamame trout caught by Hiroshi or Kenjiro is negative or greater than 100, or if the score for each char or yamame trout is negative or greater than 100, or if the additional score for every 10 chars or 20 yamame trout is negative or greater than 100, an error will occur.

### 2. Division By Zero Error

If the number of chars or yamame trout caught by Hiroshi or Kenjiro is 0, the score for each char or yamame trout will be divided by 0, resulting in an error.

### 3. Incorrect Calculation of Final Score

The final score is calculated by adding the score for each char or yamame trout, as well as the additional score for every 10 chars or 20 yamame trout. If the calculation is incorrect, the wrong winner will be declared.

### 4. Incorrect Output Format

The output should be a single line that either contains the word "hiroshi", "kenjiro", or "even". If the output format is incorrect, the program will not run correctly.

Title:
AIZU p00475 Exposition

Pain points:
**1. The input data may be malformed.**

For example, the input may contain a number that is too large, or it may contain two numbers that are not separated by a space. The program should be able to handle these cases gracefully.

**2. The program may not be able to find the optimal solution.**

The problem is NP-hard, which means that there is no known polynomial-time algorithm to find the optimal solution. The program should find a solution that is close to optimal, but it may not be able to find the exact optimal solution.

**3. The program may run out of time.**

The problem may require a lot of computation time, especially if the input data is large. The program should be able to finish running within a reasonable amount of time.

**4. The program may use too much memory.**

The problem may require a lot of memory, especially if the input data is large. The program should be able to run without using too much memory.

**5. The program may produce incorrect output.**

The program should produce the correct output for all valid input data. The program should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it produces the correct output for all possible cases.

# Problem
The problem is to count the number of possible interpretations of a given string of numbers.

# Solution
The solution is to use dynamic programming.

First, create a table `dp` of size `(n + 1) * 12`. The first dimension of the table represents the length of the input string, and the second dimension represents the character that is currently being processed. The value of `dp[i][j]` is the number of possible interpretations of the first `i` characters of the input string, where the last character is `j`.

To fill in the table, we can use the following recurrence relation:

```
dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - k]
```

where `k` is the number of times that the character `j` appears in the first `i - 1` characters of the input string.

Once the table is filled in, the answer can be found by simply summing the values in the last row of the table.

# Implementation
```python
def solve(s):
  n = len(s)
  dp = [[0] * 12 for _ in range(n + 1)]
  for i in range(n + 1):
    for j in range(12):
      if i == 0:
        dp[i][j] = 1
      else:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - (s[i - 1] - '1')]
  return sum(dp[n]) % 1000000007


s = input()
print(solve(s))

AIZU p00810 Super Star

Pain points:
14.14214
Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
* **Incorrect calculation of the sphere radius:** The radius of the smallest sphere containing all of the points can be calculated using the following formula:

```
r = sqrt(sum((xi - xc)^2 + (yi - yc)^2 + (zi - zc)^2))
```

where xi, yi, and zi are the coordinates of the ith point, and xc, yc, and zc are the coordinates of the center of the sphere. However, it is easy to make a mistake when calculating this formula, especially if you are not careful about rounding errors.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format for this problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when printing the radius of the sphere. For example, you need to make sure that the radius is rounded to 5 decimal places, and that there is no trailing whitespace.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* **Be careful when reading the input:** Make sure that you understand the input format and that you are reading the input correctly.
* **Use a good algorithm for calculating the sphere radius:** There are many different algorithms for calculating the sphere radius, and some algorithms are more accurate than others. Choose an algorithm that is appropriate for your needs and that you are confident in using.
* **Be careful when rounding the radius:** Make sure that you round the radius to the correct number of decimal places.
* **Test your code:** Once you have written your code, test it thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. Test your code with a variety of different input data sets, and make sure that it produces the correct output.

Title:
AIZU p01512 Tree Allocation

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The tree traversal algorithm should visit each node exactly once and in the correct order.
* **Incorrect calculation of the cost of allocation.** The cost of allocation is the maximum cost of the paths from the root node to each terminal node. This cost can be calculated by summing the costs of the individual paths.
* **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The input may contain invalid data, such as a negative number of nodes or a node with a self-loop. The program should handle these edge cases gracefully.
* **Memory leaks.** The program should be careful not to allocate more memory than is necessary. This can be done by using a memory pool or by freeing memory that is no longer needed.
* **Incorrect use of pointers.** Pointers can be a source of errors if they are not used correctly. The program should be careful to initialize pointers before using them and to free them when they are no longer needed.

**Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:**

* **Use a debugger to step through your code and check for errors.** This can help you identify problems in your implementation of the tree traversal algorithm and in your calculation of the cost of allocation.
* **Test your code with a variety of input data.** This can help you identify edge cases that you may have missed.
* **Use a lint tool to check your code for potential errors.** This can help you identify problems with your code style and with your use of pointers.
* **Read the documentation for the libraries that you are using.** This can help you understand how to use the libraries correctly and avoid potential errors.

Title:
AIZU p01682 Shipura

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect indentation**

When writing code, it is important to use proper indentation. This makes the code easier to read and understand, and it also helps to prevent errors. In the following code, the indentation is incorrect:

```
x = 1
y = 2
z = x + y
```

This code should be indented as follows:

```
x = 1
y = 2
z = x + y
```

**2. Missing semicolons**

Semicolons are used to separate statements in JavaScript. If a semicolon is missing, the compiler will not be able to parse the code correctly. In the following code, the semicolon after the `console.log()` statement is missing:

```
console.log("Hello world");
```

This code should be corrected as follows:

```
console.log("Hello world");
```

**3. Undeclared variables**

Variables must be declared before they can be used. In the following code, the variable `y` is used before it is declared:

```
x = 1
y = x + 2
```

This code should be corrected as follows:

```
var x = 1
var y = x + 2
```

**4. Incorrect operator precedence**

Operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated. In the following code, the `+` operator is evaluated before the `*` operator, which is incorrect:

```
x = 1 + 2 * 3
```

This code should be corrected as follows:

```
x = (1 + 2) * 3
```

**5. Logical errors**

Logical errors occur when the code does not do what the programmer intended. In the following code, the `if` statement will always be true, because the `x` variable is always greater than or equal to 0:

```
if (x >= 0) {
  console.log("x is greater than or equal to 0");
}
```

This code should be corrected as follows:

```
if (x > 0) {
  console.log("x is greater than 0");
}
```

```
Title:
AIZU p01826 Live Programming

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of this problem is "N M", where N is the number of test cases and M is the number of elements in each test case. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum sum**. The maximum sum is the sum of the largest elements in each test case. To calculate the maximum sum, the program must first find the largest element in each test case. Then, it must add the largest elements from each test case to find the maximum sum. If the program does not correctly find the largest elements in each test case, or if it incorrectly adds the largest elements, the program will produce incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating over the elements in a list, it is easy to make off-by-one errors. For example, if the program is iterating over a list of numbers, it is easy to forget to increment the index by 1 after each iteration. This can lead to the program skipping over some elements or counting some elements twice.
4. **Indexing errors**. When accessing elements in a list, it is easy to make indexing errors. For example, if the program is trying to access the first element in a list, it is easy to accidentally access the second element instead. This can lead to the program accessing incorrect data or crashing.
5. **Memory errors**. If the program does not properly manage its memory, it can run out of memory and crash. This can happen if the program allocates too much memory or if it does not free up memory when it is no longer needed.
6. **Synchronization errors**. If multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is possible for them to interfere with each other and produce incorrect results. To avoid this, the program must use synchronization mechanisms to ensure that only one thread can access the data at a time.
7. **Race conditions**. A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. If the threads are not properly synchronized, it is possible for them to corrupt the data or produce incorrect results.
8. **Deadlocks**. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can prevent the threads from making progress and can eventually cause the program to crash.
9. **Data corruption**. If the program does not properly handle errors, it is possible for it to corrupt data. This can happen if the program writes data to the wrong location or if it writes data that is not valid.
10. **Security vulnerabilities**. If the program is not properly written, it can be vulnerable to security attacks. This can happen if the program allows attackers to access sensitive data or if it allows attackers to execute arbitrary code.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not correct. For example, the input may not have two integers $H$ and $W$ in the first line, or the number of cities may not be one.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not correct. For example, the output may not have the same number of rows and columns as the input, or the output may contain characters other than '@', '*', '#', and '.'.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program may be incorrect. For example, the program may not find a valid journey, or the program may find a journey that does not maximize the number of cities.
4. **Incorrect runtime.** The program may run too slowly. For example, the program may take hours to run on a small input.
5. **Incorrect memory usage.** The program may use too much memory. For example, the program may use more than 1GB of memory on a small input.

Title:
AIZU p02248 String Search

Pain points:

 * **Off-by-one errors.** When using a loop to iterate over the characters in a string, it is important to make sure that the loop variable is incremented correctly. A common mistake is to increment the loop variable after the comparison instead of before. This can lead to the loop skipping the last character in the string.
* **Incorrect use of substrings.** When using the `substring()` method to extract a substring from a string, it is important to make sure that the start and end indices are valid. A common mistake is to use a negative start index or an end index that is greater than the length of the string. This can lead to a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` being thrown.
* **Incorrect use of the `indexOf()` method.** The `indexOf()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string. A common mistake is to use the `indexOf()` method to find the last occurrence of a substring. This can lead to the method returning `-1`, even if the substring does exist in the string.
* **Incorrect use of the `equals()` method.** The `equals()` method compares two objects to see if they are equal. A common mistake is to use the `equals()` method to compare a string to a substring. This can lead to the method returning `false`, even if the string contains the substring.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

* Use a debugger to step through your code and make sure that the loop variable is incremented correctly.
* Use the `length()` method to get the length of the string before using the `substring()` method.
* Make sure that the start and end indices for the `substring()` method are valid.
* Use the `lastIndexOf()` method to find the last occurrence of a substring in a string.
* Use the `equalsIgnoreCase()` method to compare strings that may contain different cased characters.
