Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement is not very clear, and it can be easy to misinterpret what it is asking you to do. For example, it is not immediately obvious that the gift's cost is determined uniquely, even if a gift exists whose cost is smallest in its row, but largest in its column.
* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for solving this problem is not trivial, and it is easy to make mistakes. For example, it is important to correctly handle the case where there is no value in the matrix that is smallest in its row but largest in its column.
* **Incorrect input/output.** The input and output for this problem are not very straightforward, and it is easy to make mistakes. For example, it is important to make sure that the output is formatted correctly.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement:** A developer might misinterpret the problem statement and think that the gift's cost is not determined uniquely, even if a gift exists whose cost is smallest in its row, but largest in its column. This would lead to a incorrect implementation of the algorithm.
* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm:** A developer might incorrectly implement the algorithm and not correctly handle the case where there is no value in the matrix that is smallest in its row but largest in its column. This would lead to an incorrect output.
* **Incorrect input/output:** A developer might incorrectly format the output, or not handle the case where the input is invalid. This would lead to a incorrect output.

Title:
CODECHEF ynoutput

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of test cases.** The first line of the input contains the number of test cases, T. Make sure to read this value correctly and use it to iterate over the test cases.
2. **Not checking if the candidate output matches your actual output.** The output for each test case must match the candidate output exactly. If they do not match, you should print "NO" for that test case.
3. **Not printing the output for each test case on a separate line.** The output for each test case must be printed on a separate line.
4. **Using the wrong output format.** The output for each test case must be either "YES" or "NO". Do not use any other characters or formatting.
5. **Submitting an incorrect solution.** Make sure that your solution is correct before submitting it. You can test your solution on the Codeforces practice server to make sure that it works correctly.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. Carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand the requirements.
2. Write a test case for your solution and make sure that it passes.
3. Debug your solution until you are sure that it is correct.
4. Submit your solution to the Codeforces practice server and make sure that it passes all of the test cases.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs that developers encounter when solving problems on Codeforces.

CODEFORCES 1023_G. Pisces

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type.** The input data is given as a string, but it should be parsed as an integer. This can be done using the `int()` function.
2. **Off-by-one error.** When iterating over the list of observations, it is easy to make a mistake and start at index 0 instead of 1. This will cause the program to skip the first observation.
3. **Index out of bounds error.** When accessing elements of the list of observations, it is possible to accidentally access an element that does not exist. This can be avoided by checking the index before accessing the element.
4. **Infinite loop.** The program could enter an infinite loop if it does not properly handle the end of the input data. This can be avoided by checking for the end of the input data before performing any more operations.
5. **Incorrect logic.** The program may not be correctly calculating the minimum number of fish. This could be caused by a mistake in the algorithm or by using incorrect data.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and to test the program thoroughly.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specified in the problem statement is not followed. For example, if the output contains a number that is not an integer, or if the number of professors is not equal to the number of seats, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect use of the lexicographical comparison operator**. The lexicographical comparison operator is used to compare two strings. In the problem statement, the lexicographical comparison operator is used to compare two arrangements of professors. This can lead to incorrect results if the two arrangements are not equal.
4. **Incorrect use of the senior-junior relation**. The senior-junior relation is used to determine which professor should be seated in a particular seat. In the problem statement, the senior-junior relation is used to determine which professor should be seated in the first seat. This can lead to incorrect results if the two professors are not equal in seniority.
5. **Incorrect use of the seniority level**. The seniority level is used to determine the order in which the professors are seated. In the problem statement, the seniority level is used to determine the order in which the professors are seated in the first seat.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1139_A. Even Substrings

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting even substrings.** A common mistake is to only count substrings that start and end with even digits. However, substrings that start with an odd digit and end with an even digit are also even. For example, the substring "1234" is even, even though it starts with the odd digit 1.
2. **Not handling substrings that cross the end of the string.** Another common mistake is to only consider substrings that are entirely contained within the string. However, substrings that extend beyond the end of the string are also valid. For example, the substring "12345" is even, even though it includes the digit 5, which is not in the original string.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to count even substrings. Some algorithms are more efficient than others, so it is important to choose the right algorithm for the problem at hand.
4. **Incorrectly handling special cases.** Some problems may have special cases that need to be handled separately. For example, the problem statement in this question specifies that even substrings are counted even if they are equal as strings, but have different l and r. This is a special case that needs to be handled separately from the general case.
5. **Not testing your code thoroughly.** It is important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. This includes testing your code on a variety of different inputs, including inputs that are invalid or that cause your code to crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not strictly followed. For example, the output may contain non-digit characters, or the number of digits in the output may not match the number of digits specified in the problem statement.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the maximum possible number**

The maximum possible number may not be calculated correctly. For example, the maximum possible number may be calculated using a greedy algorithm, which may not always give the correct answer.

**4. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

The problem statement may contain edge cases that are not handled correctly. For example, the problem statement may not specify what to do if the input is empty, or if the input contains all 9's.

**5. Incorrect implementation of the function f**

The function f may not be implemented correctly. For example, the function f may not map every digit from 1 to 9 to some (possibly the same) digit from 1 to 9.

**6. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm to find the maximum possible number**

The algorithm to find the maximum possible number may not be implemented correctly. For example, the algorithm may not take into account all possible subsegments of digits in the input.

**7. Incorrect runtime complexity of the algorithm**

The algorithm to find the maximum possible number may have an incorrect runtime complexity. For example, the algorithm may have a runtime complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of digits in the input.

**8. Incorrect space complexity of the algorithm**

The algorithm to find the maximum possible number may have an incorrect space complexity. For example, the algorithm may use a space complexity of O(n), where n is the number of digits in the input.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1179_C. Serge and Dining Room

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type.** The input data is given as a string, but it needs to be parsed as an integer. This can be done using the `int()` function.
2. **Incorrect index.** The index of an element in a list or array is zero-based, but the input data may start with 1. This can be fixed by subtracting 1 from the index.
3. **Off-by-one error.** The code may check if an element is in a list or array, but it may not account for the fact that the index of the last element is one less than the length of the list or array. This can be fixed by adding 1 to the index when checking if an element is in the list or array.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The code may not be correct, even if it is syntactically correct. This can be fixed by debugging the code and checking for logical errors.
5. **Memory leak.** The code may not be freeing up memory that it is no longer using. This can be fixed by using the `del` keyword to delete objects that are no longer needed.
6. **Race condition.** The code may not be thread-safe, which means that it may not work correctly if it is executed by multiple threads at the same time. This can be fixed by using locks to protect shared data.
7. **Deadlock.** The code may deadlock, which means that it will stop executing and never finish. This can be fixed by using locks to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.
8. **Stack overflow.** The code may cause a stack overflow, which means that it will run out of memory and crash. This can be fixed by reducing the recursion depth or by using a different data structure.
9. **Buffer overflow.** The code may cause a buffer overflow, which means that it will write data to a buffer that is not large enough. This can be fixed by using the `len()` function to check the size of the buffer before writing data to it.
10. **Format string vulnerability.** The code may use a format string that is not properly escaped, which can lead to a security vulnerability. This can be fixed by using the `str.format()` function to escape the format string.

CODEFORCES 1342_A. Road To Zero

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input specifies that `x` and `y` are integers, but the code may accidentally treat them as strings. This could lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect comparison operators**. The input specifies that `x` and `y` are non-negative integers, but the code may accidentally compare them with negative numbers. This could lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The code may incorrectly calculate the minimum amount of dollars needed to reach zero. For example, the code may forget to take into account the cost of the first operation.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The code may incorrectly calculate the number of operations needed to reach zero. For example, the code may forget to add one to the number of operations needed to reach zero.
5. **Infinite loops**. The code may enter an infinite loop if it does not properly check for the end of the input.
6. **Memory leaks**. The code may not properly release memory after it is no longer needed. This could lead to a memory leak.
Test inputs:
**Incorrect variable type**

```
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    print(x + y)
```

This code will incorrectly treat `x` and `y` as strings, and will therefore produce incorrect results.

**Incorrect comparison operators**

```
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if x < 0 or y < 0:
        print(-1)
    else:
        if x > y:
            print(b * (x - y))
        else:
            print(a * (y - x))
```

This code will incorrectly compare `x` and `y` with negative numbers, and will therefore produce incorrect results.

**Incorrect calculation**

```
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if x < y:
        print(a * x + b * (y - x))
    else:
        print(a * y + b * (x - y))
```

This code will incorrectly calculate the minimum amount of dollars needed to reach zero. For example, if `x = 1` and `y = 0`, the code will incorrectly print `a` instead of `a + b`.

**Off-by-one errors**

```
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if x < y:
        print(a * x + b * (y - x) + 1)
    else:
        print(a * y + b * (x - y) + 1)
```

This code will incorrectly calculate the number of operations needed to reach zero. For example, if `x = 1` and `y = 0`, the code will incorrectly print `1` instead of `0`.

**Infinite loops**

```
while True:
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 0 and y == 0:
        break
```

This code will enter an infinite loop if the input is never empty.

**Memory leaks**

```
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    print(a * x + b * (y - x))
```

This code will not properly release memory after it is no longer needed. This could lead to a memory leak.

**Correct program inputs**

The following program inputs will validate whether an implementation meets each of the requirements listed above.

1. **Incorrect variable type**

```
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    x, y = map(str, input().split())
    a, b = map(str, input().split())
    print(x + y)
```

This program input will cause the code to incorrectly treat `x` and `y` as strings, and will therefore produce incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect comparison operators**

```
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if x < 0 or y < 0:
        print(-1)
    else:
        if x > y:
            print(b * (x - y))
        else:
            print(a * (y - x))
```

This program input will cause the code to incorrectly compare `x` and `y` with negative numbers, and will therefore produce incorrect results.

3. **Incorrect calculation**

```
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):

Title:
CODEFORCES 1364_A. XXXXX

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of modulo operator**. The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. For example, 5 % 3 is 2. This means that 5 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2.
2. **Incorrect use of the bitwise AND operator**. The bitwise AND operator (&&) returns 1 if both of its operands are 1. For example, 1 && 1 is 1. This means that both 1 and 1 are 1.
3. **Incorrect use of the bitwise OR operator**. The bitwise OR operator (||) returns 1 if either of its operands is 1. For example, 1 || 0 is 1. This means that either 1 or 0 is 1.
4. **Incorrect use of the bitwise XOR operator**. The bitwise XOR operator (^) returns 1 if exactly one of its operands is 1. For example, 1 ^ 0 is 1. This means that either 1 or 0 is 1, but not both.
5. **Incorrect use of the bitwise NOT operator**. The bitwise NOT operator (~) inverts all of the bits in a binary number. For example, ~1 is 0. This means that all of the bits in 1 have been flipped to 0.
6. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. For example, if a programmer is supposed to print the first 10 numbers in a list, but they only print the first 9 numbers, this is an off-by-one error.
7. **Indexing errors**. Indexing errors occur when a programmer accesses an element of an array or list using an invalid index. For example, if a programmer tries to access the element at index 10 in an array that only has 9 elements, this is an indexing error.
8. **Null pointer errors**. Null pointer errors occur when a programmer tries to dereference a null pointer. A null pointer is a pointer that does not point to any valid memory location. For example, if a programmer tries to print the value of a variable that has been assigned a null pointer, this will cause a null pointer error.
9. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when a programmer allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
10. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same shared resource at the same time. This can lead to unpredictable and incorrect behavior.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correct. For example, the output may contain a letter that is not in the set {"Yes", "No"}.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not always find the correct answer.
4. **Memory limit exceeded**. The algorithm may use too much memory.
5. **Time limit exceeded**. The algorithm may run too long.
6. **Runtime error**. The algorithm may cause a runtime error.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1405_D. Tree Tag

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the BFS algorithm**

The BFS algorithm is a simple and efficient algorithm for traversing a graph. However, it is important to implement the algorithm correctly in order to avoid errors. One common mistake is to forget to initialize the visited array to all False values. This can lead to incorrect results, as the algorithm will not be able to distinguish between vertices that have already been visited and vertices that have not been visited.

Another common mistake is to iterate over the adjacency list of a vertex in the wrong order. The adjacency list of a vertex contains a list of all vertices that are adjacent to the given vertex. When iterating over the adjacency list, it is important to iterate over the vertices in the order that they appear in the list. This is because the BFS algorithm relies on the fact that the vertices are visited in a breadth-first order. If the vertices are not visited in a breadth-first order, the algorithm may not terminate correctly.

**2. Using an incorrect data structure to store the graph**

The data structure that is used to store the graph can have a significant impact on the performance of the BFS algorithm. One common mistake is to use an adjacency matrix to store the graph. An adjacency matrix is a two-dimensional array that stores the edges of a graph. However, adjacency matrices are not very efficient for storing graphs with a large number of vertices. A better option for storing graphs with a large number of vertices is to use an adjacency list. An adjacency list is a list of lists that stores the vertices that are adjacent to each vertex. Adjacency lists are much more efficient for storing graphs with a large number of vertices.

**3. Using an incorrect stopping condition for the BFS algorithm**

The BFS algorithm terminates when it has visited all of the vertices in the graph. However, it is important to use the correct stopping condition in order to avoid errors. One common mistake is to use a stopping condition that is too early. This can lead to the algorithm terminating before it has visited all of the vertices in the graph. Another common mistake is to use a stopping condition that is too late. This can lead to the algorithm running for an unnecessarily long time.

**4. Not handling edge cases correctly**

The BFS algorithm can be susceptible to edge cases. One common edge case is when the graph is disconnected. A disconnected graph is a graph that can be divided into two or more components that are not connected to each other. When the graph is disconnected, the BFS algorithm will only visit the vertices in one of the components. This can lead to incorrect results.

Another common edge case is when the graph contains a cycle. A cycle is a path in a graph that starts and ends at the same vertex. When the graph contains a cycle, the BFS algorithm may not terminate correctly. This is because the algorithm will continue to visit the vertices in the cycle until it reaches a maximum number of iterations.

**5. Not using the BFS algorithm correctly**

The BFS algorithm is a powerful tool for traversing a graph. However, it is important to use the algorithm correctly in order to avoid errors. Some common mistakes that people make when using the BFS algorithm include:

* Using the algorithm on a graph that is not connected.
* Using the algorithm on a graph that contains a cycle.
* Using the algorithm to find the shortest path between two vertices.
* Using the algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph.
* Using the algorithm to find the maximum flow in a graph.

CODEFORCES 1426_F. Number of Subsequences

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of mod operator**. The mod operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. For example, 10 % 3 = 1. This means that 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. These are errors that occur when you forget to add or subtract 1 from a calculation. For example, if you are counting the number of elements in a list, you might forget to add 1 to the final count.
3. **Incorrect use of loops**. Loops are a powerful tool, but they can also be a source of errors. Make sure that you understand how loops work before using them in your code.
4. **Incorrect use of functions**. Functions can make your code more readable and reusable, but they can also be a source of errors. Make sure that you understand how functions work before using them in your code.

CODEFORCES 1473_E. Minimum Path

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is given in the form of two integers n and m, which represent the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph. However, if the input data is not in the correct format, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will likely crash.

**2. Mismatched data**

The input data also contains three integers v_i, u_i, and w_i, which represent the endpoints of the i-th edge and its weight, respectively. However, if the data is not properly matched, the program will not be able to correctly construct the graph and will likely crash.

**3. Incorrect graph construction**

Once the input data has been processed, the program must construct the graph. If the graph is not constructed correctly, the program will not be able to find the minimum weight of the path from the 1-st vertex to the i-th vertex for each i (2 ≤ i ≤ n).

**4. Incorrect path finding**

Once the graph has been constructed, the program must find the minimum weight of the path from the 1-st vertex to the i-th vertex for each i (2 ≤ i ≤ n). If the path finding algorithm is not correct, the program will not be able to find the correct answer.

**5. Incorrect output**

Finally, the program must output the minimum weight of the path from the 1-st vertex to the i-th vertex for each i (2 ≤ i ≤ n). If the output is not correct, the program will not receive full credit.

CODEFORCES 1499_G. Graph Coloring

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to put a space between two numbers, the input parser will not be able to correctly parse the input.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format for this problem is also very specific. You need to make sure that your output is formatted correctly, or the judge will not be able to correctly evaluate your solution. For example, if you forget to put a newline character at the end of your output, the judge will not be able to correctly parse your output.
3. **Incorrect use of data structures**. This problem requires you to use data structures to store the graph and the colorings. If you use the wrong data structures, your solution will not be efficient and it will not be able to solve the problem in time.
4. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithms**. The algorithms for solving this problem are not trivial, and it's easy to make a mistake when implementing them. For example, if you forget to update the hash of the coloring after you change the color of an edge, your solution will not be correct.
5. **Incorrect debugging**. When you are debugging your solution, it's important to make sure that you are debugging the correct code. For example, if you are debugging the code that prints the output, but the problem is actually in the code that computes the hash of the coloring, you will not be able to find the bug.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. **Read the problem carefully**. Make sure that you understand the problem before you start writing your solution.
2. **Test your code**. Write unit tests to test your code and make sure that it is correct.
3. **Use the right data structures**. Use the right data structures to store the graph and the colorings.
4. **Implement the algorithms correctly**. Make sure that you implement the algorithms correctly.
5. **Debug your code carefully**. Make sure that you are debugging the correct code.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1550_E. Stringforces

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains two integers n and k, which are the length of the string and the number of first Latin letters used. If we use int to store these two values, we may get incorrect results when n or k is large. For example, if n = 2147483647, then int n will overflow.

To avoid this problem, we can use long long to store n and k.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the maximum value of the string after every question mark is replaced with one of the first k lowercase Latin letters. We can use the following algorithm to solve this problem:

1. Iterate over all possible strings of length k.
2. For each string, replace every question mark with one of the first k lowercase Latin letters.
3. Calculate the value of the string.
4. Find the maximum value of all the strings.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(k^n), which is too slow. We can use a better algorithm to solve this problem.

**3. Not handling special cases**

The input may contain special characters such as newline characters and space characters. We need to handle these special characters correctly.

**4. Making a mistake in the implementation**

When implementing the algorithm, we need to be careful to avoid making mistakes. For example, we need to make sure that we are using the correct data types and that we are not overflowing any variables.

**5. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code to make sure that it is correct. We can test the code with different input values to make sure that it is working correctly.

* The output may not be valid. For example, it may contain a non-integer number or a number that is greater than the maximum possible score.
* The code may not be efficient enough. For example, it may take a long time to run or it may use too much memory.
* The code may not be correct. For example, it may not produce the correct output for all possible inputs.

Here are some specific examples of problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer may not correctly parse the input. For example, they may assume that the input is a single integer when it actually contains multiple integers.
* The developer may not correctly calculate the maximum possible score. For example, they may only consider the first few moves of the game when calculating the score.
* The developer may not use an efficient algorithm to solve the problem. For example, they may use a brute-force algorithm that takes a long time to run.
* The developer may make a logical error in their code. For example, they may assume that the game always ends after a certain number of moves when it actually does not.

By being aware of these possible problems and bugs, developers can write more robust and efficient code.

Title:
CODEFORCES 26_E. Multithreading

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not well-defined.**

The input format does not specify the order of the numbers in the first line. This could lead to confusion if the numbers are not in the expected order. For example, if the first line of input is `1 2 3`, it is not clear whether `1` is the number of processes, `2` is the value of `W`, and `3` is the first `ni` value, or if `1` is the value of `W`, `2` is the number of processes, and `3` is the second `ni` value.

**2. The output format is not well-defined.**

The output format does not specify the order of the numbers in the second line. This could lead to confusion if the numbers are not in the expected order. For example, if the second line of output is `1 2 3`, it is not clear whether `1` is the first process to execute its next instruction, `2` is the second process to execute its next instruction, and `3` is the third process to execute its next instruction, or if `1` is the second process to execute its next instruction, `2` is the third process to execute its next instruction, and `3` is the first process to execute its next instruction.

**3. The problem statement does not specify what happens if a process is interrupted while executing its loop.**

The problem statement does not specify what happens if a process is interrupted while executing its loop. This could lead to unexpected results if the process is interrupted while it is in the middle of updating the value of `y`. For example, if a process is interrupted while it is incrementing the value of `y`, the value of `y` could be incorrect when the process resumes execution.

**4. The problem statement does not specify what happens if a process executes its loop more than the specified number of times.**

The problem statement does not specify what happens if a process executes its loop more than the specified number of times. This could lead to unexpected results if the process executes its loop more than the specified number of times. For example, if a process executes its loop twice, the value of `y` could be twice the specified value of `W`.

**5. The problem statement does not specify what happens if the value of `W` is negative.**

The problem statement does not specify what happens if the value of `W` is negative. This could lead to unexpected results if the value of `W` is negative. For example, if the value of `W` is -1, the value of `y` could never be equal to `W`.

**6. The problem statement does not specify what happens if the sum of the `ni` values is not equal to the number of processes.**

The problem statement does not specify what happens if the sum of the `ni` values is not equal to the number of processes. This could lead to unexpected results if the sum of the `ni` values is not equal to the number of processes. For example, if the sum of the `ni` values is 5 and the number of processes is 4, the value of `y` could never be equal to `W`.

Title:
CODEFORCES 293_B. Distinct Paths

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly and in the correct order. For example, if you are expecting three integers but only read two, your program will not work correctly.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer. Make sure that you are formatting your output correctly and that it is the correct type. For example, if you are trying to print an integer but your output is a string, your program will not work correctly.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

This problem is a classic example of an off-by-one error. When you are iterating over an array or list, it is important to make sure that you are not missing any elements or counting them twice. For example, if you are trying to count the number of elements in an array but you start at index 0 and end at index n-1, you will miss the last element.

**4. Undefined behavior**

This problem can also be solved using dynamic programming. However, it is important to be careful when using dynamic programming, as it is easy to introduce undefined behavior. For example, if you are trying to memoize a function but you do not initialize the memoization table correctly, your program will not work correctly.

**5. Memory leaks**

This problem does not require a lot of memory, but it is still important to be aware of memory leaks. A memory leak occurs when you allocate memory but do not free it when you are finished with it. This can eventually lead to your program running out of memory and crashing.

**6. Runtime errors**

This problem can be solved in a variety of ways, but some solutions are more efficient than others. It is important to choose a solution that is both correct and efficient. If your solution is not efficient, it may run out of time and your program will be marked as incorrect.

**7. Incorrect logic**

This problem requires you to reason about the possible paths that can be taken from the upper left square to the lower right square. It is important to make sure that you are considering all of the possible paths and that you are not making any incorrect assumptions.

Title:
CODEFORCES 316_G3. Good Substrings

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when parsing it. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when printing the result. For example, if you forget to add a newline character at the end of the output, the program will not compile.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When counting the number of occurrences of a substring in a string, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, if you are looking for the occurrences of the substring "ab" in the string "abc", you might accidentally count the occurrence at index 1 as two occurrences instead of one.

**4. Memory leaks**

When allocating memory for dynamic data structures, it is important to free the memory when you are done with it. Otherwise, you will eventually run out of memory and the program will crash.

**5. Race conditions**

When multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is important to ensure that the data is always consistent. Otherwise, you might get incorrect results.

**6. Deadlocks**

When multiple threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, it is possible for them to deadlock. This means that the threads will be stuck waiting forever and the program will never terminate.

**7. Buffer overflows**

When copying data from one buffer to another, it is important to make sure that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the data. Otherwise, you might overwrite data that you didn't mean to overwrite.

**8. Security vulnerabilities**

When writing code, it is important to be aware of potential security vulnerabilities. For example, you should never trust user input without first validating it.

**9. Incorrect algorithm**

Even if you write your code correctly, you might still get the wrong answer if you use an incorrect algorithm. For example, if you are trying to find the shortest path in a graph, you might use a breadth-first search algorithm instead of a depth-first search algorithm.

Title:
CODEFORCES 528_C. Data Center Drama

Pain points:
Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is not very well-defined. It is not clear whether the numbers in the input should be separated by spaces or commas, or whether they should be enclosed in parentheses. This can lead to errors if the developer does not correctly parse the input.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format for this problem is also not very well-defined. It is not clear whether the numbers in the output should be separated by spaces or commas, or whether they should be enclosed in parentheses. This can lead to errors if the developer does not correctly format the output.
* **Incorrect use of pointers:** This problem involves a lot of pointer arithmetic, and it is easy to make mistakes if the developer is not careful. For example, the developer might accidentally dereference a null pointer, or they might try to access an element of an array that is out of bounds.
* **Off-by-one errors:** This problem involves a lot of counting, and it is easy to make mistakes if the developer does not keep track of their indices correctly. For example, the developer might accidentally count one element too many or one element too few.
* **Incorrect use of data structures:** This problem involves a lot of use of data structures, and it is easy to make mistakes if the developer does not use the data structures correctly. For example, the developer might accidentally create a data structure that is too small, or they might try to insert an element into a data structure that is already full.
* **Incorrect use of algorithms:** This problem involves a lot of use of algorithms, and it is easy to make mistakes if the developer does not use the algorithms correctly. For example, the developer might accidentally use an algorithm that is not designed for the problem at hand, or they might use an algorithm incorrectly.
* **Incorrect debugging:** This problem can be difficult to debug, especially if the developer does not have a good understanding of the problem. It is important to be able to identify the source of the error and to fix it quickly.

CODEFORCES 554_A. Kyoya and Photobooks

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input string may not be a valid string of lowercase English letters. For example, the input string "123" is not a valid string of lowercase English letters.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer. For example, the output "51a" is not a valid integer.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of distinct photobooks**. The number of distinct photobooks is the number of ways to insert one extra photo into the photobook. This can be calculated by multiplying the number of possible positions for the extra photo by the number of possible photos that can be inserted.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. When calculating the number of possible positions for the extra photo, it is important to remember that the photo can be inserted at the beginning or end of the photobook. This means that there are actually 2 * |s| + 1 possible positions for the extra photo.
5. **Off-by-one errors**. When calculating the number of possible photos that can be inserted, it is important to remember that the extra photo cannot be the same as any of the photos already in the photobook. This means that there are actually 26 - |s| possible photos that can be inserted.
6. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the developer may incorrectly use a data structure that is not appropriate for the problem, or the developer may make a mistake in their algorithm.

Title:
CODEFORCES 57_E. Chess

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input specifies that the maximum number of moves a knight can make is 1018, which is larger than the maximum value of a 32-bit integer. If you try to use a 32-bit integer to store this value, you will get an overflow error.

To avoid this problem, you can use a 64-bit integer type, such as `long long` in C++.

**2. Not handling the case where all squares are deleted**

The input specifies that the number of deleted squares can be up to 440. If all squares are deleted, then the knight cannot move anywhere, and the answer is 0.

You need to make sure to handle this case correctly.

**3. Using incorrect modulo arithmetic**

The output must be printed modulo 1000000007. If you do not use the correct modulo arithmetic, your answer will be incorrect.

To avoid this problem, you can use the `%` operator in C++.

**4. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a simple brute-force algorithm. However, this algorithm is very inefficient and will not pass the time limit on large inputs.

A more efficient algorithm is to use dynamic programming. This algorithm works by building up a table of the number of squares that the knight can reach from each starting square. The table can be built up in a bottom-up fashion, starting with the squares that are closest to the starting square.

The dynamic programming algorithm runs in time O(k^2 n), where k is the maximum number of moves and n is the number of deleted squares. This is much faster than the brute-force algorithm, which runs in time O(k^3 n).

**5. Not handling corner cases correctly**

The problem has a few corner cases that you need to handle correctly. For example, you need to handle the case where the starting square is deleted.

You can handle these corner cases by adding special cases to your code.

**6. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it to Codeforces. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed.

You can test your code using a variety of tools, such as the Codeforces problem tester or the online compiler.

**7. Not submitting your code on time**

The Codeforces contest timer starts as soon as you click the "Submit" button. If you do not submit your code on time, you will not be able to compete in the contest.

To avoid this problem, make sure to submit your code as early as possible.

CODEFORCES 601_D. Acyclic Organic Compounds

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The tree traversal algorithm should visit each vertex exactly once and in a depth-first order.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum value of <image>.** This is another common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The maximum value of <image> should be calculated by considering all possible subtrees of the tree.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of vertices with the maximum value of <image>.** This is a less common mistake, but it can still lead to incorrect results. The number of vertices with the maximum value of <image> should be calculated by considering all possible subtrees of the tree and counting the number of vertices in each subtree that have the maximum value of <image>.
4. **Incorrect handling of special cases.** The input may contain special cases, such as a tree with no vertices or a tree with only one vertex. The developer should be careful to handle these cases correctly.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The input may contain errors, such as invalid data or missing data. The developer should be careful to handle these errors correctly.

**Some tips for avoiding these problems:**

1. **Test your code thoroughly.** This is the best way to find and fix bugs.
2. **Use a debugger to help you track down errors.** A debugger can help you identify the exact line of code that is causing the error.
3. **Read the problem statement carefully and make sure you understand it.** This will help you avoid making mistakes in your implementation.
4. **Ask for help if you get stuck.** There are many resources available to help you solve programming problems.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs that developers encounter when solving this problem.

CODEFORCES 624_B. Making a String

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a single integer n, followed by a line with n integers ai. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer, representing the maximum length of the string that meets all the requirements. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will likely get a compilation error.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The program must correctly implement the following two conditions:
    * the i-th letter occurs in the string no more than ai times;
    * the number of occurrences of each letter in the string must be distinct for all the letters that occurred in the string at least once.
    If the logic is incorrect, the program will not be able to find the maximum length of the string and will likely produce an incorrect output.
4. **Memory leaks.** The program must not allocate any memory that it does not need. If the program allocates memory that it does not need, it will eventually run out of memory and crash.
5. **Time complexity.** The program must run in polynomial time. If the program runs in exponential time, it will not be able to solve large instances of the problem in a reasonable amount of time.

CODEFORCES 763_B. Timofey and rectangles

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of rectangles is not a positive integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values must be correct. For example, if the coordinates of a rectangle are given as strings, the program will not be able to process them correctly.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are common in programming, and they can lead to incorrect results. For example, if a program is supposed to count the number of rectangles in a list, but it starts counting at index 0 instead of index 1, the result will be incorrect.
4. **Logic errors**. Logic errors are errors in the program's logic, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if a program is supposed to find the maximum value in a list, but it does not check for negative values, the result will be incorrect.
5. **Memory errors**. Memory errors can occur when a program allocates too much or too little memory. For example, if a program allocates too much memory, it may crash. If a program allocates too little memory, it may not be able to store all of the data it needs, which can lead to incorrect results.
6. **Synchronization errors**. Synchronization errors can occur when multiple threads or processes try to access the same data at the same time. For example, if two threads try to update the same variable at the same time, the results will be incorrect.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can occur when a program is not properly protected from malicious attacks. For example, if a program allows users to input arbitrary data, it may be possible for a malicious user to inject code into the program, which could lead to a security breach.

Title:
CODEFORCES 923_E. Perpetual Subtraction

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not specified clearly, so it is easy to make mistakes when reading the input. For example, if the input format is not specified as "two integers N and M", a developer may mistakenly read the input as "one integer N" and then get the wrong answer.
* **Incorrect calculation:** The calculation of the final distribution of numbers can be very complicated. It is easy to make mistakes in the calculation, especially when dealing with large numbers. For example, if a developer mistakenly uses the wrong formula to calculate the final distribution, the answer will be incorrect.
* **Memory overflow:** The problem requires the developer to output a list of N+1 integers, where N can be as large as 10^5. If the developer does not use an efficient data structure to store the list, the program may run out of memory and crash.
* **Time limit exceeded:** The problem requires the developer to solve the problem in a limited amount of time. If the developer's algorithm is too slow, the program may not finish running before the time limit is reached.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully read the problem statement and make sure they understand the input format and output format. They should also carefully check their calculations and use an efficient data structure to store the list of numbers. Finally, they should test their code to make sure it runs within the time limit.

Title:
CODEFORCES 952_A. Quirky Quantifiers

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input is an integer, so the developer should use the `int` data type to store it. However, if the developer accidentally uses a smaller data type, such as `char` or `short`, the value of the input may be truncated, which will lead to incorrect results.

**2. Not handling the edge cases**

The input is an integer between 10 and 999. If the developer does not handle the edge cases, such as `a == 10` or `a == 999`, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The problem asks to output 1 if the input is a prime number, and 0 otherwise. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. The developer must use the correct logic to determine whether the input is a prime number.

**4. Not using a constant time algorithm**

The problem can be solved in constant time using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. However, if the developer uses a linear time algorithm, such as the brute force algorithm, the program will run slowly for large inputs.

**5. Not using the most efficient data structures**

The problem can be solved using a hash table to store the prime numbers. However, if the developer uses a less efficient data structure, such as a linked list, the program will run slower.

**6. Not using the best programming practices**

The developer should use the best programming practices to write the code, such as using descriptive variable names, commenting the code, and following the style guide. This will make the code easier to read and maintain.

CODEFORCES 979_C. Kuro and Walking Route

Pain points:
 * (2, 3): his route would be 2 → 1 → 3.
 **1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of integers. However, if the developer accidentally uses a string type, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect algorithm**

The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the developer may try to find all the pairs of towns that Kuro can take as his route, and then count the number of such pairs. However, this algorithm is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that Kuro cannot visit Beetopia after he has visited Flowrisa.

**3. Off-by-one error**

The developer may make an off-by-one error when counting the number of pairs of towns that Kuro can take as his route. For example, the developer may forget to count the pair of towns (1, 2) in the first example.

**4. Memory leak**

The developer may create a memory leak if they do not properly free the memory that they allocate. This can cause the program to crash or run out of memory.

**5. Race condition**

The developer may create a race condition if they access shared data from multiple threads without proper synchronization. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.

**6. Deadlock**

The developer may create a deadlock if they have multiple threads that are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely.

Title:
CODEFORCES 999_D. Equalize the Remainders

Pain points:
**Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs:**

1. **Incorrect Modulo Operation:** When performing modulo operations, it is important to make sure that the modulus is always positive. For example, if you are trying to find the remainder of 10 divided by 3, you would need to do `10 % 3`, not `10 % -3`.
2. **Off-by-one Errors:** When iterating over an array, it is important to make sure that you do not go out of bounds. For example, if you are iterating over an array of size 5, you would need to check that `i < 5` before accessing the element at index `i`.
3. **Incorrect Indexing:** When accessing elements of an array, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct index. For example, if you are trying to access the first element of an array, you would need to use `a[0]`, not `a[1]`.
4. **Incorrect Typecasting:** When converting between different data types, it is important to make sure that the conversion is done correctly. For example, if you are trying to convert a `int` to a `float`, you would need to use the `float()` function.
5. **Memory Leaks:** When allocating memory, it is important to make sure that you free it up when you are done with it. For example, if you create a `vector` of `int`s, you would need to call `delete[] vector` when you are done with it.

**Additional Tips:**

* When debugging your code, it can be helpful to print out the values of your variables to see what is happening.
* If you are stuck on a problem, it can be helpful to look at the solutions of other people.
* There are many online resources available to help you learn programming, such as books, websites, and online courses.

HACKEREARTH benny-and-interesting-numbers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect logic**. The developer might not understand the problem statement correctly and implement incorrect logic. For example, the developer might think that a number is interesting if it has an odd number of divisors, when it actually needs to have an odd number of interesting proper divisors.
2. **Incorrect implementation**. The developer might implement the logic correctly but make a mistake in the implementation. For example, the developer might forget to check for the base case of `N = 1`.
3. **Incorrect test cases**. The developer might not test the code thoroughly and miss some corner cases. For example, the developer might not test the code with negative numbers or numbers that are not integers.
4. **Incorrect runtime**. The developer might implement the code in a way that is inefficient and takes too long to run. For example, the developer might use a brute-force approach that checks every possible divisor of a number.
5. **Incorrect memory usage**. The developer might implement the code in a way that uses too much memory. For example, the developer might create a large array to store all of the divisors of a number.

Title:
HACKEREARTH come-to-me

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem is asking for the maximum number of soldiers with different skills, not the maximum number of soldiers in total.
2. **Using an incorrect data structure.** The problem states that the input will be a string of characters, so a string or list data structure should be used. Using a list of integers would result in incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect algorithm.** The correct algorithm for this problem is to iterate through the string of characters, keeping track of the number of different skills seen so far. The maximum number of soldiers with different skills is the largest value of this count.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating through the string of characters, it is important to make sure that the index is incremented correctly. An off-by-one error could result in the incorrect number of soldiers being counted.
5. **Incorrectly handling boundary conditions.** The problem states that the input will be a string of at least one character, so it is important to handle the case where the input is empty. An incorrect handling of this case could result in a runtime error.
6. **Using incorrect variable names.** Using incorrect variable names could make the code difficult to read and understand. For example, using `n` to refer to the number of soldiers instead of the number of characters in the string could result in confusion.
7. **Using incorrect data types.** Using incorrect data types could result in incorrect results. For example, using an integer to store the number of different skills seen could result in overflow errors.
8. **Not using comments.** Using comments can help to make the code more readable and understandable. This is especially important for complex code or code that is not written in a standard style.
9. **Not testing the code.** It is important to test the code to ensure that it is correct. This can be done by creating test cases that cover all of the possible scenarios.

Title:
HACKEREARTH fibofibo-3

Pain points:
**1. Off-by-one errors**

The most common bug when writing recursive functions is off-by-one errors. This happens when the programmer forgets to add or subtract 1 from a variable when calling the function recursively. For example, in the code above, the function fibo(n) returns 1 more than the number of times 1 is printed. This is because the function fibo(n) calls itself twice, once with n - 1 and once with n - 2. The first call to fibo(n - 1) prints 1, and the second call to fibo(n - 2) prints 1. So, fibo(n) prints 2, which is one more than the number of times 1 is printed.

To avoid off-by-one errors, it is important to be careful when decrementing or incrementing variables. It is also helpful to draw a diagram or write out the steps of the recursion in order to visualize what is happening.

**2. Incorrect base cases**

Another common bug when writing recursive functions is incorrect base cases. The base cases are the cases where the function can be solved without calling itself recursively. In the code above, the base cases are n == 0 and n == 1. If these cases are not handled correctly, the function will not terminate and will run forever.

To avoid this bug, it is important to make sure that the base cases are handled correctly. This means that the function should return a valid value for n == 0 and n == 1. In the code above, the function returns 0 for n == 0 and 1 for n == 1. This is correct, because 0 and 1 are the first two Fibonacci numbers.

**3. Recursion stack overflow**

Recursive functions can also cause stack overflow errors. This happens when the function calls itself so many times that the stack runs out of space. To avoid this, it is important to make sure that the function terminates after a finite number of calls. In the code above, the function terminates after n == 0 or n == 1. This is because the function returns a valid value for these two cases.

**4. Incorrect output**

Finally, recursive functions can also produce incorrect output if the logic of the function is incorrect. This can happen if the function is not written correctly or if the base cases are not handled correctly. To avoid this, it is important to carefully review the code and make sure that it is correct.

In addition to the four bugs listed above, there are a number of other potential problems that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:

* Using the wrong data type for the function arguments or return value
* Using incorrect mathematical formulas
* Making logical errors in the code
* Not handling errors correctly

By being aware of these potential problems, developers can avoid them and write correct, efficient code.

Title:
HACKEREARTH icl-3-bacteria-population

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect calculation of the population**

The most important bug that a developer may encounter when solving this problem is incorrect calculation of the population. This can happen if the developer does not correctly account for the fact that the bacteria population grows exponentially. For example, if the developer calculates the population as `population = population_last_year + 1`, they will get the wrong answer. The correct calculation is `population = population_last_year * 2`.

**2. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

Another common bug that developers encounter is incorrect handling of edge cases. For example, if the developer is asked to calculate the population after the 0th year, they will need to return 1, not 0. Similarly, if the developer is asked to calculate the population after a year that is greater than the number of years that the bacteria has been alive, they will need to return 0.

**3. Incorrect use of data structures**

Finally, developers may also encounter bugs when using data structures to solve this problem. For example, if the developer uses a list to store the population of the bacteria over time, they will need to be careful to ensure that the list is large enough to store the entire population. If the list is not large enough, the developer may get an error.

**Solutions to these problems**

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that they understand the requirements. They should also carefully test their code to ensure that it is correct. Additionally, developers should use data structures that are appropriate for the problem that they are solving.

Title:
HACKEREARTH margana-is-an-anagram

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect comparison of strings.** The most common bug is to compare two strings using the `==` operator. This operator only checks if the two strings are equal, not if they are anagrams. To check if two strings are anagrams, you need to use a different algorithm.
2. **Incorrect use of the `sort()` function.** The `sort()` function can be used to sort a list of strings in alphabetical order. However, it does not change the order of the letters in each string. This means that if you sort two strings and then compare them, you will not be able to tell if they are anagrams.
3. **Incorrect use of the `count()` function.** The `count()` function can be used to count the number of occurrences of a particular character in a string. However, it does not take into account the order of the characters. This means that if you use the `count()` function to compare two strings, you will not be able to tell if they are anagrams.
4. **Incorrect use of the `zip()` function.** The `zip()` function can be used to combine two lists into a single list of tuples. However, it does not take into account the order of the elements in the lists. This means that if you use the `zip()` function to compare two lists, you will not be able to tell if they are anagrams.
5. **Incorrect use of the `in` operator.** The `in` operator can be used to check if a particular element is in a list. However, it does not take into account the order of the elements in the list. This means that if you use the `in` operator to compare two lists, you will not be able to tell if they are anagrams.

Title:
HACKEREARTH number-mania

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the `isPrime()` function.** The `isPrime()` function checks if a number is prime. However, it does not take into account negative numbers or numbers greater than 3. If a developer incorrectly uses the `isPrime()` function, they may incorrectly identify a number as prime, which could lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect use of the `factorial()` function.** The `factorial()` function calculates the factorial of a number. However, it does not take into account negative numbers or numbers greater than 12. If a developer incorrectly uses the `factorial()` function, they may incorrectly calculate the factorial of a number, which could lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect use of the `range()` function.** The `range()` function returns a sequence of numbers from a starting point to an ending point. However, it does not take into account negative numbers or numbers greater than the maximum value of `int`. If a developer incorrectly uses the `range()` function, they may incorrectly iterate over a range of numbers, which could lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect use of the `print()` function.** The `print()` function prints a value to the console. However, it does not take into account the format of the value being printed. If a developer incorrectly uses the `print()` function, they may incorrectly format the output, which could make it difficult to read and understand.
5. **Incorrect use of the `input()` function.** The `input()` function reads a value from the console. However, it does not take into account invalid input. If a developer incorrectly uses the `input()` function, they may incorrectly read a value from the console, which could lead to incorrect results.

Title:
HACKEREARTH shil-and-special-pairs

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain extra spaces or tabs, or it may not be in the correct order. The developer should check the input format carefully and handle any errors appropriately.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be in the wrong data type. For example, the input may contain strings when it should contain integers. The developer should check the data type of the input data and convert it to the correct type if necessary.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer may make off-by-one errors when calculating the answer to a query. For example, the developer may forget to add 1 to the index of the last element in a range. The developer should carefully check their calculations to avoid off-by-one errors.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may make mistakes in their logic when solving the problem. For example, the developer may assume that all of the elements in the permutation are distinct, when in fact they may not be. The developer should carefully check their logic to ensure that it is correct.
5. **Memory leaks**. The developer may create memory leaks when they allocate memory for variables that they no longer need. The developer should use the `delete` keyword to free up memory that is no longer needed.
6. **Incorrect output format**. The developer may output the answer to a query in the wrong format. For example, the developer may output the answer as a string when it should be an integer. The developer should carefully check the output format and correct any errors.

Title:
HACKEREARTH the-magician-17

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable types**. The problem statement states that `N` and `K` are integers, but the code below incorrectly defines them as strings. This will cause errors when the code is run.
2. **Incorrect variable names**. The problem statement uses the variable names `N` and `K`, but the code below uses the variable names `n` and `k`. This will cause confusion for the reader and make it difficult to debug the code.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code below incorrectly calculates the position of the card numbered `K`. It should be `K - 1`, but the code instead calculates `N - K`. This will cause the code to output the wrong answer.
4. **Missing error handling**. The code below does not handle errors gracefully. If the user enters invalid input, the code will crash.
5. **Inefficient code**. The code below can be significantly improved by using more efficient algorithms.

Here is a corrected version of the code that solves the problem correctly:

ATCODER p02666 NOMURA Programming Competition 2020 - Urban Planning

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain a non-integer value, or the number of towns may be less than 2.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not strictly followed. For example, the output may not be a single integer, or the output may not be modulo 10^9+7.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not find the minimum number of roads needed to meet all the requests, or the algorithm may not work for all possible inputs.

**4. Runtime error**

The algorithm may not run in time for large inputs. For example, the algorithm may take exponential time to run on inputs of size N.

**5. Memory error**

The algorithm may not be able to allocate enough memory to run on large inputs. For example, the algorithm may need to store a table of size N^2, which may not be possible on systems with limited memory.

**6. Security vulnerability**

The algorithm may contain a security vulnerability. For example, the algorithm may allow an attacker to read or write arbitrary data from the system.

Title:
ATCODER p02795 Keyence Programming Contest 2020 - Painting

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input format specifies that `H`, `W`, and `N` are integers. However, if you accidentally use a floating-point type, you may get incorrect results. For example, if you use `float` for `H`, `W`, and `N`, the following code will output `1.0` instead of `2`:

```
h, w, n = map(float, input().split())
print(min(h, w) // n + 1)
```

To avoid this problem, make sure to use the correct data type for `H`, `W`, and `N`.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks you to find the minimum number of operations needed to have `N` or more black squares in the grid. One possible algorithm is to start with a grid that is all white, and then repeatedly paint rows or columns until you have `N` or more black squares. However, this algorithm is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution. For example, if `H` and `W` are both even, and `N` is odd, then the optimal solution is to paint one row and one column, but this algorithm will paint two rows or two columns.

A better algorithm is to first find the minimum number of operations needed to paint `N` squares in a single row or column. Then, you can double this number to find the minimum number of operations needed to paint `N` squares in the entire grid.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When counting the number of operations, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, if you are counting the number of rows that need to be painted, you might accidentally count the first row twice. To avoid this problem, make sure to check your calculations carefully.

**4. Undefined behavior**

The problem states that `H`, `W`, and `N` are all integers. However, it does not specify what happens if any of these values are negative. If you try to run the code on negative values, you may get undefined behavior. To avoid this problem, make sure that all of the values in the input are positive.

Title:
ATCODER p02931 Japanese Student Championship 2019 Qualification - Card Collector

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The problem states that all values are integers. However, if the input is not in the correct format, the program may crash or produce incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a float value, the program may crash.

**2. Incorrect logic**

The program must correctly implement the algorithm for finding the maximum possible sum of the integers written on the picked cards. If the algorithm is incorrect, the program may produce incorrect results. For example, the program may not consider all possible combinations of cards to pick.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors can occur when the program is not careful about the indices of arrays or lists. For example, the program may try to access an element of an array that does not exist.

**4. Memory leaks**

The program must be careful not to allocate memory that is not needed. If the program does not free up memory that is no longer needed, it may eventually run out of memory and crash.

**5. Race conditions**

Race conditions can occur when multiple threads try to access the same data at the same time. If the program is not careful about how it synchronizes access to shared data, it may produce incorrect results or crash.

**6. Deadlocks**

Deadlocks can occur when multiple threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. If the program does not handle deadlocks correctly, it may eventually hang or crash.

**7. Security vulnerabilities**

The program must be careful not to introduce any security vulnerabilities. For example, the program must not allow attackers to inject malicious code into the program.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not standard. Make sure you read the problem statement carefully and follow the format.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The input data may be in the wrong data type. For example, a string may be read as an integer, or an integer may be read as a float. Make sure you convert the data to the correct data type before using it.

**3. Off-by-one error**

A common mistake is to forget to add or subtract 1 when computing an index. For example, you may accidentally index into an array with index i+1 when you meant to index with index i.

**4. Logical error**

You may make a mistake in your logic. For example, you may assume that a certain condition is true when it is not, or you may forget to check for a certain case.

**5. Runtime error**

You may make a mistake that causes your program to crash. For example, you may try to divide by zero, or you may access a memory location that is out of bounds.

**6. Time complexity**

Your program may be too slow. Make sure you optimize your code to run as efficiently as possible.

**7. Space complexity**

Your program may use too much memory. Make sure you use data structures that are appropriate for the problem and that you don't allocate unnecessary memory.

Title:
ATCODER p03680 AtCoder Beginner Contest 065 - Trained?

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The input format specifies that `N` is an integer, but the code below treats it as a string. This will cause the code to fail when `N` is not a valid integer.
2. **Off-by-one error.** The code below checks if `a[i] == 2` for every `i` from 1 to `N`, but it should check for `i` from 2 to `N`. This will cause the code to incorrectly report that it is impossible to light up button 2 when it is actually possible.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The code below assumes that if button 1 is lit up, then it is possible to light up button 2 by pressing button 2. This is not always the case, as button 2 may be lit up by pressing another button.
4. **Unnecessary computation.** The code below computes the value of `a[i]` for every `i` from 1 to `N`, even though it only needs to compute the value of `a[2]`. This unnecessary computation wastes time and resources.
5. **Inefficient algorithm.** The code below uses a brute-force algorithm to find the minimum number of button presses required to light up button 2. This algorithm is inefficient, as it can take a long time to run for large values of `N`.

To avoid these problems, you should:

1. Make sure that all variables are of the correct type.
2. Check for off-by-one errors.
3. Use correct logic.
4. Avoid unnecessary computation.
5. Use an efficient algorithm.

Title:
ATCODER p03835 AtCoder Beginner Contest 051 - Sum of Three Integers

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input values are integers, so we need to use the `int` data type to store them. If we use a smaller data type, such as `short`, `char`, or `byte`, we may get incorrect results.

**2. Using the wrong formula**

The formula for the number of triples of X, Y, and Z that satisfy the condition is `(S + 3K) choose 3`. If we use the wrong formula, we will get incorrect results.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When counting the number of triples, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, we might forget to include the case where X = Y = Z.

**4. Using a brute-force approach**

The brute-force approach to solving this problem is to enumerate all possible triples of X, Y, and Z and check if they satisfy the condition. This approach is inefficient and will not work for large values of K and S.

**5. Using a divide-and-conquer approach**

A divide-and-conquer approach can be used to solve this problem more efficiently. The idea is to divide the set of all triples into smaller sets, and then solve the problem for each of the smaller sets. This approach can be used to solve the problem in O(K^2) time.

**6. Using a dynamic programming approach**

A dynamic programming approach can also be used to solve this problem efficiently. The idea is to build up a table of values, where each value represents the number of triples that satisfy the condition for a given value of S. This approach can be used to solve the problem in O(K^3) time.

Title:
ATCODER p04000 AtCoder Beginner Contest 045 - Snuke's Coloring

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is as follows:

```
H W N
a_1 b_1
:
a_N b_N
```

where `H` and `W` are the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively, and `N` is the number of cells that Snuke painted. The following are examples of incorrect input formats:

* `H W N a_1 b_1`
* `H W N a_1 b_1 : a_N`
* `H W N a_1 b_1 : a_N b_N`

If the input format is incorrect, the program will likely crash or produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The input data is given as integers. If the input data is not in the correct format, the program will likely crash or produce incorrect output.

For example, the following input data is incorrect:

```
H W N a_1 b_1 : a_N b_N
1 2 3 'a' 'b'
```

The `a_1` and `b_1` values should be integers, but they are strings in this case. The program will likely crash or produce incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect calculation**

The program needs to calculate the number of subrectangles of size 3×3 that contain exactly j black cells. The following is an example of incorrect calculation:

```
def count_subrectangles(H, W, N, a, b):
  # This is incorrect because it only counts the subrectangles that are
  # entirely contained in the grid.

  count = 0
  for i in range(H-2):
    for j in range(W-2):
      if a[i] <= a[i+1] <= a[i+2] and b[j] <= b[j+1] <= b[j+2]:
        count += 1
  return count
```

The correct calculation is as follows:

```
def count_subrectangles(H, W, N, a, b):
  # This is the correct calculation.

  count = 0
  for i in range(H-2):
    for j in range(W-2):
      if a[i] <= a[i+1] <= a[i+2] and b[j] <= b[j+1] <= b[j+2]:
        count += 1
  return count
```

**4. Insufficient memory**

The program needs to store the data of all the cells that Snuke painted. If the number of cells that Snuke painted is too large, the program may run out of memory.

To avoid this problem, you can use a data structure that is more memory-efficient, such as a hash table.

**5. Inefficient algorithm**

The program needs to calculate the number of subrectangles of size 3×3 that contain exactly j black cells. The following is an inefficient algorithm:

```
def count_subrectangles(H, W, N, a, b):
  # This is an inefficient algorithm because it enumerates all possible
  # subrectangles.

  count = 0
  for i in range(H):
    for j in range(W):
      for k in range(i+2, H):
        for l in range(j+2, W):
          if a[i] <= a[k] and b[j] <= b[l]:
            count += 1
  return count
```

A more efficient algorithm is as follows:

```
def count_subrectangles(H, W, N, a, b):
  # This is a more efficient algorithm because it only considers
  # subrectangles that are entirely contained in the grid.

  count = 0
  for i in range(H-2):
    for j in range(W-2):
      if a[i] <= a[i+1] <= a[i+2] and b[j] <= b[j+1] <= b[j+2]:
        count += 1
  return count
```

**6. Incorrect output format**

The output of the program should be in the following format:

# Problem: AIZU p01005 The Humans Braving the Invaders

## Problem description

Today, the Earth has been attacked by the invaders from space, Invader, and the only survivors of humankind are us at the base. There is almost no force left to compete with them. But here we do not give up. Eradication of Invaders is the last resort for us humans to survive. I will explain the contents of the strategy that will be the last from now on.

First of all, our strength is too small compared to the strength of the Invader, so we will stay at this base and fight the siege. Surrounded by high mountains, the base has no choice but to take a straight road in front of the base for the invaders to invade. We will call this road a field. With this feature, it is possible to concentrate on the front and attack the invader. At the base, we attack the Invader with two types of weapons. One is a sniper rifle that snipers one invader. The other is a grenade launcher that can attack over a wide area.

As the only programmer in humanity, your job is to simulate combat based on Invaders and our action records. Action records are given in query format. Each query consists of one or more integers and is given as follows:

0 | Invaders appear on the field at a distance of L from the base.
--- | ---
1 d | All invaders currently on the field approach the base by d. After this action, the invaders that reach the base will take damage, and their enemies will disappear from the field. If it is damaged, "damage (the number of invaders that reached the base at this time)" is output on one line.
2 k | If the number of invaders currently on the field is k or more, attack the kth invader from the closest to the base with a sniper rifle. The invader disappears from the field. And output "hit" on one line. If the number of invaders on the field is less than k, print "miss" on one line.
3 x r | Attack with a grenade launcher in the range r at a position x from the base. All invaders that land at a distance of x from the base and are less than or equal to r will disappear from the field. Then output "bomb (number of invaders killed)" on one line. As a side note, the base will not be damaged by the grenade launcher.
4 k | If the number of invaders on the field is k or more, output "distance (distance between the kth invader from the closest base to the base)" on one line. If the number of invaders on the field is less than k, print "distance -1" on one line.




That is all for the explanation of the strategy. All members start the operation! ... Good luck.

## Constraints

The input satisfies the following conditions.

* All values ​​contained in the input are integers
* 1 ≤ Q ≤ 100000
* 1 ≤ L ≤ 109
* 1 ≤ d, k ≤ 109
* 0 ≤ x ≤ L
* 0 ≤ r ≤ 109
* There can never be more than one invader in the same position
* No more than 3 datasets

## Input

The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset is represented below. The first line is given two integers Q and L separated by spaces. The following Q line is given the Q queries described above. The end of the input consists of two zeros.

## Output

For each dataset, output for queries that have output instructions. Print "end" at the end of each dataset.

## Example

```

```

## Solution

### 1. Brute force

The brute force solution is to iterate over all the queries and perform the corresponding operations. This is a simple and straightforward solution, but it is not very efficient.

```python

            else:
                print('hit')
                invaders[args[0] - 1] = 0
        if q == 3:

        print(num1 + num2 - 2)
    else:
        print(num1 + num2 - 1)
```

## Possible Problems

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when entering the data. For example, if you forget to put a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output for this problem should be a single integer, representing the minimum number of swaps required to sort the balls. If you output anything else, the program will not be able to correctly evaluate your solution.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When counting the number of swaps required, it's easy to make a mistake and count one swap too many or too few. This can lead to a incorrect solution.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The logic for this problem is fairly straightforward, but it's still possible to make a mistake. For example, you might forget to take into account the fact that the balls are doubled, or you might not correctly account for the order in which the balls are swapped.
5. **Memory errors.** If you don't allocate enough memory for the data, the program will crash. This is especially important to keep in mind if you're using a language like Python, which has a relatively small default memory allocation.

## Possible Bugs

1. **Infinite loop.** If you make a mistake in your logic, it's possible that the program will enter an infinite loop. This can happen if you have a condition that is always true, or if you have a loop that never terminates.
2. **Stack overflow.** If you make a mistake in your recursion, it's possible that the program will cause a stack overflow. This can happen if you have a recursive function that calls itself too many times, or if you have a recursive function that calls itself with a large argument.
3. **Segmentation fault.** If you make a mistake in your memory management, it's possible that the program will cause a segmentation fault. This can happen if you try to access a memory address that doesn't exist, or if you try to write to a memory address that is read-only.
4. **Type errors.** If you make a mistake in your type declarations, it's possible that the program will generate type errors. This can happen if you try to use a variable of the wrong type, or if you try to call a function with the wrong arguments.
5. **Logical errors.** If you make a mistake in your logic, it's possible that the program will produce incorrect results. This can happen if you forget to account for all of the possible cases, or if you make a mistake in your calculations.

    if num1 > num2:
        print(num1 + num2 - 2)
    else:
        print(num1 + num2 - 1)

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correct. For example, the number of vertices in a map is not an integer, or the number of edges in a map is negative.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correct. For example, the output contains a value that is not a real number, or the output is not rounded to 10-1 decimal places.
* **Incorrect solution:** The solution is incorrect. For example, the shortest path from the entrance to the exit does not exist, or the shortest path is not found.
* **Memory limit exceeded:** The solution exceeds the memory limit. For example, the solution uses too much memory to store the data of the maps.
* **Time limit exceeded:** The solution exceeds the time limit. For example, the solution takes too long to find the shortest path from the entrance to the exit.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input format and output format, and make sure that the solution is correct. The developer should also be aware of the memory and time limits, and design the solution to be efficient.

It would be better to use names that more clearly indicate what they represent, such as `$num_sweets$`, `$num_friends$`, `$price_of_sweet$`, `$taste_of_sweet$`, `$price_limit_of_friend$`, and `$number_of_sweets_allowed_for_friend$`.
2. **Incorrect data types**. The variables `$N$`, `$M$`, `$A_i$`, `$B_i$`, `$C_j$`, and `$D_j$` are all integers, but they are being declared as strings. This could lead to errors if the input data is not properly formatted. It would be better to declare these variables as integers so that they can be properly processed.
3. **Incorrect use of loops**. The code uses two nested for loops to iterate over the list of sweets and the list of friends. This is inefficient, as it could be done with a single loop. It would be better to use a single loop that iterates over both lists simultaneously.
4. **Incorrect use of conditional statements**. The code uses a series of nested if statements to determine which sweets to bring. This is inefficient, as it could be done with a single if statement. It would be better to use a single if statement that checks whether each sweet meets the criteria for being brought.
5. **Incorrect use of functions**. The code uses a function called `max()` to find the maximum value in a list. This function is not necessary, as the built-in `max()` function can be used to achieve the same result. It would be better to use the built-in `max()` function instead of the custom `max()` function.
6. **Incorrect use of variables**. The code uses the variable `$total_cost` to store the total cost of the sweets that are being brought. This variable is not necessary, as the total cost can be calculated directly from the list of sweets. It would be better to remove the variable `$total_cost` from the code.
7. **Incorrect indentation**. The code is not properly indented, which makes it difficult to read and understand. It would be better to indent the code so that it is more readable.
8. **Incorrect comments**. The code does not contain any comments, which makes it difficult to understand what the code is doing. It would be better to add comments to the code so that it is easier to understand.
9. **Incorrect error handling**. The code does not handle errors gracefully. If the input data is not properly formatted, the code will crash. It would be better to handle errors gracefully so that the code does not crash.
10. **Incorrect unit testing**. The code does not include any unit tests. This makes it difficult to ensure that the code is correct. It would be better to include unit tests so that the code can be tested more thoroughly.

Title:
AIZU p02312 Intersection of a Circle and a Polygon

Pain points:
1. The input may not be valid. For example, the number of points may be less than 3, or the radius may be negative.
2. The polygon may not be convex. This means that there may be two points in the polygon that are connected by a line segment that does not lie entirely within the polygon.
3. The polygon may intersect itself. This means that there may be two points in the polygon that are connected by a line segment that lies entirely within the polygon.
4. The circle may intersect the polygon in more than one place. In this case, the area of intersection is the sum of the areas of the individual intersections.
5. The circle may not intersect the polygon at all. In this case, the area of intersection is 0.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. Check the input carefully to make sure that it is valid.
2. Use a convex hull algorithm to find the convex hull of the polygon. This will ensure that the polygon is not self-intersecting.
3. Use a ray-casting algorithm to find the intersections between the circle and the polygon. This will ensure that you find all of the intersections, even if they are not obvious.
4. Use a numerical integration method to calculate the area of the intersections. This will give you a more accurate result than simply counting the number of intersections.
5. Check your results carefully to make sure that they are correct.
