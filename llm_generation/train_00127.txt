Title:
CODECHEF insoma3

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the input/output.** The input is a list of integers, so the developer should use a list or array to store the input. The output is an integer, so the developer should use an integer variable to store the output.

**2. Not handling edge cases correctly.** The input may contain an empty list, a list with one element, or a list with all elements equal. The developer should handle these edge cases correctly.

**3. Using an inefficient algorithm.** The developer should use an efficient algorithm to solve the problem. A simple recursive algorithm would be inefficient, as it would have to recompute the same subproblems multiple times. A more efficient algorithm would be to use a dynamic programming approach.

**4. Making a mistake in the implementation.** The developer could make a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm, such as using the wrong variable or index. The developer should carefully check their code for errors.

**5. Not testing the code.** The developer should test their code to make sure that it works correctly. They should test the code with different input values, including edge cases.

Title:
CODECHEF nextnum

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not specified in the problem statement. A developer may incorrectly assume that the input is a single integer, when it is actually a list of integers. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the rank**

The rank of a number is calculated by finding the number of permutations of the digits in the number that are less than the number itself. A developer may incorrectly calculate the rank by simply counting the number of digits in the number. This would lead to the program producing incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect handling of duplicate digits**

The problem statement states that the number of digits in the input can be up to 18. This means that it is possible for the input to contain duplicate digits. A developer may incorrectly assume that the number of permutations of a number with duplicate digits is the same as the number of permutations of a number without duplicate digits. This would lead to the program producing incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect handling of leading zeros**

The problem statement states that the input can start with a zero. A developer may incorrectly assume that the number of permutations of a number with a leading zero is the same as the number of permutations of a number without a leading zero. This would lead to the program producing incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect handling of negative numbers**

The problem statement does not specify whether the input can be negative. A developer may incorrectly assume that the input can only be positive. This would lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

Title:
CODECHEF salary

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input type**. The input may contain invalid characters, such as letters or special symbols. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect data format**. The input may not be in the correct format, such as missing a comma between two numbers or having a number in the wrong place. This can also cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results or taking a long time to run.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. The program may be incorrectly implemented, such as using the wrong data types or having errors in the logic. This can also lead to the program producing incorrect results or taking a long time to run.
5. **Incorrect testing**. The program may not be tested thoroughly enough. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results or crashing in unexpected ways.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input for errors, use the correct data format, use an efficient algorithm, implement the program correctly, and test the program thoroughly.

Title:
CODECHEF zeroes

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input and output constraints for this problem are very small, so it's easy to make a mistake and use the wrong data type. For example, if you try to use an integer to store the number of trailing zeros, you will get an overflow error.

**2. Not considering all possible cases**

The problem statement states that `N` can be any integer from 1 to 10000. However, many solutions only consider the case where `N` is a power of 2. This can lead to incorrect results for other values of `N`.

**3. Using an inefficient algorithm**

The naive algorithm for finding the number of trailing zeros in a number is to repeatedly divide the number by 10 until the remainder is 0. This algorithm is very inefficient, as it takes O(log n) time. There are more efficient algorithms that can be used, such as the following:

```
def count_trailing_zeros(n):
  """Counts the number of trailing zeros in a number."""

  count = 0
  while n % 10 == 0:
    count += 1
    n //= 10
  return count
```

**4. Not handling errors correctly**

The problem statement does not specify what should happen if the input is invalid. For example, if the input is a negative number, it is not clear what the output should be. It is important to handle errors correctly in your code, so that you don't get unexpected results.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed. You can test your code by using a variety of different inputs, including both valid and invalid inputs.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or a string that is not a sequence of lowercase Latin letters.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may contain a string that is not "Yes" or "No", or the output may not be enclosed in quotation marks.
3. **Incorrect solution**. The solution may not correctly solve the problem. For example, the solution may not find a way to recolor all the puppies into one color, or the solution may recolor some puppies into a color that is not the same as all the other puppies.
4. **Memory limit exceeded**. The solution may use too much memory, which will cause the program to crash.
5. **Time limit exceeded**. The solution may take too long to run, which will cause the program to time out.
6. **Incorrect data type**. The solution may use the wrong data type for a variable, which will cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1045_C. Hyperspace Highways

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.**

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that computes the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. It is a very efficient algorithm, but it is important to implement it correctly in order to avoid bugs.

One common mistake is to initialize the distance matrix with the correct values for the edges in the graph. For example, if the graph contains an edge from vertex `u` to vertex `v` with weight `w`, then the distance from `u` to `v` in the distance matrix should be initialized to `w`. However, some developers forget to do this, and they initialize the distance matrix to all zeros. This will result in incorrect results for the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

Another common mistake is to use the wrong formula to update the distance matrix in the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. The correct formula is:

```
d[i][j] = min(d[i][j], d[i][k] + d[k][j])
```

where `d[i][j]` is the distance from vertex `i` to vertex `j`, and `k` is an intermediate vertex. Some developers forget to add the distance from `i` to `k` to the distance from `k` to `j`. This will also result in incorrect results for the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the Union-Find data structure.**

The Union-Find data structure is a data structure that can be used to find the connected components of a graph. It is a very efficient data structure, but it is important to implement it correctly in order to avoid bugs.

One common mistake is to initialize the parent array with all values set to `-1`. This will result in incorrect results for the Union-Find data structure. The correct way to initialize the parent array is to set all values to `0`.

Another common mistake is to use the wrong formula to find the root of a node in the Union-Find data structure. The correct formula is:

```
root(x) = find(find(x))
```

where `find(x)` returns the parent of node `x`. Some developers forget to apply the `find()` function twice. This will also result in incorrect results for the Union-Find data structure.

**3. Incorrect implementation of the Kruskal algorithm.**

The Kruskal algorithm is an algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree in a weighted graph. It is a very efficient algorithm, but it is important to implement it correctly in order to avoid bugs.

One common mistake is to use the wrong formula to calculate the weight of a spanning tree. The correct formula is:

```
w(T) = \sum_{(u,v) \in T} w(u,v)
```

where `w(T)` is the weight of the spanning tree `T`, and `w(u,v)` is the weight of the edge from vertex `u` to vertex `v`. Some developers forget to add the weight of each edge to the total weight of the spanning tree. This will result in incorrect results for the Kruskal algorithm.

Another common mistake is to use the wrong order to add edges to the spanning tree. The correct order is to add the edges in ascending order of weight. Some developers add the edges in a random order. This will result in incorrect results for the Kruskal algorithm.

**4. Incorrect implementation of the Prim algorithm.**

The Prim algorithm is an algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree in a weighted graph. It is a very efficient algorithm, but it is important to implement it correctly in order to avoid bugs.

One common mistake is to use the wrong formula to calculate the weight of a spanning tree. The correct formula is:

```
w(T) = \sum_{(u,v) \in T} w(u,v)
```

where `w(T)` is the weight of the spanning tree `T`, and `w(u,v)` is the weight of the edge from vertex `u` to vertex `v`. Some developers forget to add the weight of each edge to the total weight of the spanning tree. This will result in incorrect results for the Prim algorithm.

Another common mistake is to use the wrong order to add edges to the spanning tree. The correct order is to add the edges in ascending order of weight. Some developers add the edges in a random order. This will result in incorrect results for the Prim algorithm.

CODEFORCES 1090_A. Company Merging

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very strict. It allows for multiple spaces between integers, and it also allows for leading and trailing spaces. However, if the input format is not followed correctly, the program will not be able to read the input correctly and will output an incorrect answer.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also not very strict. It allows for multiple spaces between integers, and it also allows for leading and trailing spaces. However, if the output format is not followed correctly, the program will not be able to write the output correctly and will not receive full credit.

**3. Merging companies with different maximum salaries**

The problem statement states that companies can only be merged if they have the same maximum salary. However, if two companies have different maximum salaries, the program may try to merge them anyway. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**4. Increasing salaries by too much**

The labor union insists that all employees in a company must get the same increase in salary. However, if the program increases salaries by too much, it may not be able to merge all of the companies. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**5. Not minimizing the total increase**

The goal of the problem is to minimize the total increase in salaries. However, if the program does not minimize the total increase, it will not receive full credit.

 **Possible problems and bugs:**

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake. For example, you may accidentally write `5 100` instead of `5 100`. This will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the sum**. The sum of a large number of elements can be a very large number. If you do not take this into account, the program may overflow and crash.
3. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic**. Modulo arithmetic is a powerful tool, but it is also easy to make mistakes. For example, you may accidentally calculate `a % b` instead of `(a + b) % c`. This will give you the wrong answer.
4. **Incorrect use of data structures**. The data structures used in the program must be able to handle large amounts of data. If you use a data structure that is too small, the program may crash.
5. **Incorrect use of algorithms**. The algorithms used in the program must be efficient. If you use an inefficient algorithm, the program may run too slowly.
6. **Incorrect error handling**. The program should be able to handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input format is incorrect, the program should print an error message and exit.
7. **Incorrect testing**. The program should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it works correctly. If you do not test the program properly, it may contain bugs that will not be found until it is too late.

CODEFORCES 1139_B. Chocolates

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data contains a lot of integers. If we use an incorrect data type to store the input data, it may cause overflow. For example, if we use `int` to store the number of chocolates of each type, then the input `1000000000` will cause overflow.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the maximum number of chocolates we can buy. A naive solution is to try all possible combinations of chocolates and pick the one that has the largest number of chocolates. However, this solution has a time complexity of O(2^n), which is too slow. A better solution is to use dynamic programming.

**3. Not handling corner cases**

The problem statement mentions that "for all 1 ≤ j < i at least one of the following must hold:

  * x_j = 0 (you bought zero chocolates of type j)
  * x_j < x_i (you bought less chocolates of type j than of type i)".

We need to make sure that our solution handles this corner case correctly.

**4. Debugging**

Once we have implemented our solution, we need to debug it to make sure that it is correct. We can use a debugger to step through our code and check if it is doing what we expect it to do. We can also use unit tests to test our code.

CODEFORCES 1197_F. Coloring Game

Pain points:
**Possible problems**

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain a number that is too large or too small. The developer should check the input format and raise an error if it is incorrect.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correct. For example, the output may contain a number that is not an integer. The developer should check the output format and raise an error if it is incorrect.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm. For example, the algorithm may not terminate or may not produce the correct output. The developer should test the algorithm thoroughly to ensure that it is correct.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer may not release memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash. The developer should use a memory management tool to track memory usage and identify memory leaks.
5. **Race conditions**. The developer may not synchronize access to shared data. This can lead to a race condition, which can cause the program to produce incorrect results or to crash. The developer should use locks or other synchronization mechanisms to ensure that only one thread can access shared data at a time.
6. **Deadlocks**. The developer may create a deadlock, which is a situation where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely. The developer should use locks carefully to avoid deadlocks.
7. **Buffer overflows**. The developer may write data to a buffer that is not large enough. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect results. The developer should use the correct size for buffers and should check for buffer overflows.
8. **Format string vulnerabilities**. The developer may use a format string that is not properly escaped. This can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the program. The developer should use the correct escape sequences for format strings.
9. **SQL injection vulnerabilities**. The developer may not properly sanitize user input before using it in a SQL statement. This can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database. The developer should use a prepared statement or a parameterized query to prevent SQL injection attacks.

**Possible bugs**

1. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer may accidentally miscount the number of elements in an array or list. This can lead to incorrect results or to a program crash.
2. **Null pointer dereferences**. The developer may accidentally dereference a null pointer. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect results.
3. **Arithmetic errors**. The developer may make a mistake in an arithmetic calculation. This can lead to incorrect results or to a program crash.
4. **Logic errors**. The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program. This can lead to incorrect results or to a program crash.
5. **Incorrect variable initialization**. The developer may not initialize a variable correctly. This can lead to incorrect results or to a program crash.
6. **Unused variables**. The developer may declare a variable but never use it. This can lead to a memory leak.
7. **Unreachable code**. The developer may write code that is never executed. This can lead to a security vulnerability.
8. **Duplicate code**. The developer may copy and paste code from one place to another. This can lead to errors and make the code difficult to maintain.
9. **Inconsistent code style**. The developer may use different coding styles in different parts of the code. This can make the code difficult to read and maintain.

CODEFORCES 1214_G. Feeling Good

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format must be exactly as specified in the problem statement. For example, if the output contains a number that is not an integer, the program will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program must correctly implement the algorithm for determining the chameleon's mood. For example, if the program does not consider all possible cases, it will be incorrect.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program must not leak memory. This can be a difficult problem to debug, as it can often be difficult to track down the source of the leak.
5. **Synchronization issues**. If the program is multi-threaded, it must be synchronized correctly. This can be a difficult problem to debug, as it can often be difficult to track down the race conditions.
6. **Deadlocks**. If the program is multi-threaded, it must be deadlock-free. This can be a difficult problem to debug, as it can often be difficult to track down the deadlocks.
7. **Race conditions**. If the program is multi-threaded, it must be free of race conditions. This can be a difficult problem to debug, as it can often be difficult to track down the race conditions.
8. **Null pointer exceptions**. The program must not throw any null pointer exceptions. This can be a difficult problem to debug, as it can often be difficult to track down the source of the null pointer exception.
9. **Stack overflows**. The program must not throw any stack overflow exceptions. This can be a difficult problem to debug, as it can often be difficult to track down the source of the stack overflow exception.
10. **Out-of-bounds errors**. The program must not access any memory that is out of bounds. This can be a difficult problem to debug, as it can often be difficult to track down the source of the out-of-bounds error.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1238_A. Prime Subtraction

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of `x % y == 0`.** This operator checks if `x` is divisible by `y`, but it does not check if `y` is prime. For example, `10 % 5 == 0`, but `5` is not prime.
2. **Incorrect use of `x // y`.** This operator divides `x` by `y`, but it does not check if `y` is prime. For example, `10 // 5 == 2`, but `5` is not prime.
3. **Incorrect use of the Sieve of Eratosthenes.** The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a very efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit. However, it is important to use the algorithm correctly. For example, the following code will not find all prime numbers up to `100`:

```
for i in range(2, 100):
    if i % 2 == 0 or i % 3 == 0:
        continue
    else:
        print(i)
```

This code will only print the prime numbers that are not divisible by 2 or 3. To find all prime numbers up to `100`, you would need to use a different algorithm, such as the Miller-Rabin primality test.
4. **Incorrect use of the Miller-Rabin primality test.** The Miller-Rabin primality test is a probabilistic algorithm for testing if a number is prime. However, it is important to use the algorithm correctly. For example, the following code will not always correctly identify prime numbers:

```
def is_prime(n):
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

This code will incorrectly identify numbers that are divisible by a prime number greater than `int(n ** 0.5)` as prime. To correctly identify prime numbers, you would need to use a different algorithm, such as the Solovay-Strassen primality test.

CODEFORCES 127_B. Canvas Frames

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the sticks' lengths.** The problem states that the sticks' lengths are between 1 and 100, so we should use an integer data type to store them. Using a floating-point data type could lead to incorrect results.

**2. Not considering the fact that the sticks can be reused.** The problem states that Nicholas can reuse the sticks to make frames, so we need to keep track of the number of times each stick is used. If we don't do this, we might underestimate the number of frames that Nicholas can make.

**3. Not considering the fact that the sticks can be different lengths.** The problem states that the sticks' lengths are not necessarily the same, so we need to be able to compare sticks of different lengths. If we don't do this, we might accidentally make a frame that is too big or too small.

**4. Not considering the fact that the sticks can be arranged in different ways.** The problem states that Nicholas can make frames of different sizes, so we need to be able to find the best way to arrange the sticks to make the most frames. If we don't do this, we might not find the optimal solution.

**5. Not handling errors correctly.** The problem could have errors in the input data, such as a negative stick length or a stick length that is too large. We need to handle these errors correctly so that our program doesn't crash.

**3. The input may not be symmetric.** The input should be symmetric with respect to the central button of the terminal. If the input is not symmetric, the program should return NO.

**4. The program may not correctly identify the central button of the terminal.** The central button of the terminal is the button that is located in the middle of the matrix. The program should correctly identify this button and use it to check for symmetry.

**5. The program may not correctly check for symmetry.** The program should check for symmetry by comparing the characters in each row and column of the matrix. If the characters in each row and column are the same, then the matrix is symmetric. If the characters in each row and column are not the same, then the matrix is not symmetric.

**6. The program may not print the correct output.** The program should print YES if the input is symmetric and NO if the input is not symmetric. If the program does not print the correct output, it is considered to be a bug.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1342_B. Binary Period

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect regular expression**

When matching a string against a regular expression, it is important to make sure that the regular expression is correct. A common mistake is to forget to escape special characters, such as the period (.) or the caret (^). This can lead to the regular expression matching the wrong string or not matching any string at all.

**2. Using the wrong data type**

When working with strings, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct data type. For example, if you are trying to match a string against a regular expression, you need to make sure that the string is a string object, not a byte array.

**3. Using the wrong algorithm**

There are many different algorithms for matching strings against regular expressions. The correct algorithm to use depends on the specific problem you are trying to solve. For example, if you are trying to match a string against a regular expression that contains backreferences, you will need to use a different algorithm than if you are trying to match a string against a regular expression that does not contain backreferences.

**4. Not handling errors correctly**

When matching a string against a regular expression, it is important to handle errors correctly. For example, if the regular expression is invalid, you should raise an exception. If the regular expression does not match the string, you should return an appropriate error message.

**5. Not using a test suite**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before deploying it to production. This includes testing your code with different types of input data, including invalid data. By testing your code thoroughly, you can catch bugs early and prevent them from causing problems in production.

CODEFORCES 1473_F. Strange Set

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the strange set definition.** The definition of a strange set is not always clear, and it is easy to make mistakes when implementing it. For example, a common mistake is to check whether `a_j divides a_i` for all `j < i`, instead of `j <= i - 1`.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the cost of a strange set.** The cost of a strange set is the sum of the `b_i` values for all elements `i` in the set. It is easy to make mistakes when calculating this sum, especially if the set is large.
3. **Memory limit exceeded.** The memory limit for this problem is unusual, so it is important to be careful about memory usage. One common way to exceed the memory limit is to create a large array or vector.
4. **Time limit exceeded.** The time limit for this problem is also unusual, so it is important to be careful about the running time of your solution. One common way to exceed the time limit is to use a recursive algorithm.
5. **Incorrect input handling.** The input for this problem is not always formatted correctly, so it is important to check the input carefully and handle any errors appropriately.
6. **Incorrect output formatting.** The output for this problem must be a single integer. It is easy to make mistakes when formatting the output, especially if the integer is large.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1523_A. Game of Life

Pain points:
 * 1110111101 — third iteration of evolution 
 **1. Incorrect understanding of the problem statement**

The most important bug that a developer may encounter when solving this problem is to incorrectly understand the problem statement. For example, a developer may think that the problem is asking to find the state of the array after n iterations of evolution, when in fact the problem is asking to find the state of the array after m iterations of evolution.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

Another common bug that a developer may encounter is to incorrectly implement the algorithm for finding the state of the array after m iterations of evolution. For example, a developer may forget to account for the fact that all alive elements stay alive, or may not correctly calculate the number of alive neighbors for each element.

**3. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

Finally, a developer may also encounter bugs due to incorrectly handling edge cases. For example, a developer may not correctly handle the case where the array is empty, or may not correctly handle the case where the number of iterations is zero.

**Here are some tips for avoiding these bugs:**

* **Read the problem statement carefully and make sure you understand it completely.**
* **Write out an algorithm for solving the problem before you start coding.**
* **Test your code thoroughly with a variety of input values.**
* **Be careful to handle edge cases correctly.**

By following these tips, you can help to avoid the most common bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1550_F. Jumping Around

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect implementation of the jumping distance range.** The frog should be able to jump to any rock at a distance from `d - k` to `d + k` inclusive in any direction. This means that the frog can jump to a rock that is `d - k` units away from its current position, or to a rock that is `d + k` units away from its current position. It is important to make sure that the frog is able to jump to rocks that are within this range.
* **Incorrect implementation of the jumping sequence.** The frog can perform an arbitrary number of jumps in a sequence. This means that the frog can jump to the same rock multiple times, or it can jump to different rocks in any order. It is important to make sure that the frog is able to perform an arbitrary number of jumps in a sequence.
* **Incorrect implementation of the base jumping distance parameter.** The frog has a base jumping distance parameter of `d`. This means that the frog can jump to any rock that is within a distance of `d` units from its current position. It is important to make sure that the frog is able to jump to rocks that are within this range.
* **Incorrect implementation of the testcases.** The testcases should be correctly formatted and should contain the correct information. It is important to make sure that the testcases are correctly implemented so that the program can correctly process them.
* **Incorrect implementation of the output.** The output should be correctly formatted and should contain the correct information. It is important to make sure that the output is correctly implemented so that the program can correctly print the results.

By following these tips, you can avoid these common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 245_C. Game with Coins

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n, and the second line should contain a sequence of space-separated integers. If the input does not match this format, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the program should print a single integer, which is the minimum number of moves needed to finish the game. If the program prints anything other than a single integer, or if the integer is not the correct value, the output will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The program must correctly implement the game rules in order to determine the minimum number of moves needed to finish the game. If the program's logic is incorrect, it will not be able to correctly determine the minimum number of moves and will likely produce incorrect output.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over the input or output, it is important to be careful to avoid off-by-one errors. For example, if the program iterates over the input starting at index 0, it will miss the first element of the input. Similarly, if the program prints the output starting at index 0, it will overwrite the first element of the output.
5. **Memory leaks.** The program must be careful to free any memory that it allocates. If the program does not free memory that it allocates, it will eventually run out of memory and crash.
6. **Synchronization issues.** If the program is multi-threaded, it must be careful to synchronize access to shared resources. If the program does not synchronize access to shared resources, it may produce incorrect results or deadlock.
7. **Race conditions.** If the program is multi-threaded, it must be careful to avoid race conditions. A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same resource at the same time. If the program does not handle race conditions correctly, it may produce incorrect results or deadlock.
8. **Deadlocks.** A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. If the program does not handle deadlocks correctly, it may hang indefinitely.

Title:
CODEFORCES 364_C. Beautiful Set

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible that the developer will misinterpret it and make a mistake. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or it may contain multiple spaces between numbers.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is possible that the developer will misinterpret it and make a mistake. For example, the output may not contain the correct number of numbers, or it may not be space-separated.
3. **Incorrect calculation of beautiful set**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the beautiful set. For example, they may not consider all of the possible prime factors of the numbers in the set, or they may not correctly determine how many numbers in the set should be divisible by each prime factor.
4. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers**. The problem states that each element in the set should not exceed 2k2. However, floating-point numbers are not precise, so it is possible that the developer will accidentally use a number that is slightly larger than 2k2. This could cause the set to be incorrect.
5. **Incorrect use of loops**. The developer may incorrectly use loops to iterate over the numbers in the set. For example, they may use a loop that iterates over all of the numbers from 1 to 2k2, even though not all of these numbers are in the set. This could cause the set to be incorrect.
6. **Incorrect use of conditional statements**. The developer may incorrectly use conditional statements to determine which numbers to include in the set. For example, they may use a conditional statement that only checks whether a number is divisible by a certain prime factor, even though it is also necessary to check whether the number is less than 2k2. This could cause the set to be incorrect.
7. **Incorrect use of functions**. The developer may incorrectly use functions to calculate the beautiful set. For example, they may use a function that returns the wrong number of numbers in the set, or they may use a function that returns the wrong numbers in the set. This could cause the set to be incorrect.
8. **Incorrect use of variables**. The developer may incorrectly use variables to store the numbers in the set. For example, they may use a variable that is too small to store all of the numbers in the set, or they may use a variable that is not initialized to the correct value. This could cause the set to be incorrect.
9. **Incorrect use of memory**. The developer may incorrectly use memory to store the numbers in the set. For example, they may allocate too much memory, or they may not free the memory that they allocated. This could cause the program to crash or to run slowly.
10. **Incorrect use of file I/O**. The developer may incorrectly use file I/O to read the input and write the output. For example, they may not open the files correctly, or they may not close the files correctly. This could cause the program to crash or to lose data.

Title:
CODEFORCES 408_E. Curious Array

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the binomial coefficient**

The binomial coefficient is defined as ```nCr = n!/(r!(n-r)!)```. A common mistake is to divide by ```(n-r)!``` instead of ```(n-r)!(r-1)!```. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**2. Incorrect handling of overflow**

The binomial coefficient can be very large, so it is important to handle overflow correctly. One way to do this is to use the [modpow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation) function.

**3. Incorrect use of the modulo operator**

The modulo operator is often used to ensure that the answer is within the correct range. However, it is important to remember that the modulo operator does not commute, so ```a % b % c != (a % c) % b```. This can lead to incorrect results if the order of operations is not correct.

**4. Incorrect handling of negative integers**

The binomial coefficient is defined for positive integers only. If a negative integer is passed to the binomial coefficient function, an error will be thrown.

**5. Incorrect handling of zero**

The binomial coefficient of ```nCr``` is equal to ```1``` if ```r = 0``` or ```r = n```. However, if ```r < 0``` or ```r > n```, the binomial coefficient is undefined. It is important to handle these cases correctly.

**6. Incorrect handling of duplicate queries**

If the same query is repeated multiple times, the answer will be incorrect. It is important to ensure that each query is only processed once.

Title:
CODEFORCES 480_A. Exams

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible that the input will not be in the correct format. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or it may contain two numbers that are not separated by a space. If the input is not in the correct format, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will produce an incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is possible that the output will not be in the correct format. For example, the output may not be a single integer, or it may not be an integer that is greater than or equal to 1. If the output is not in the correct format, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will produce an incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic of the program may be incorrect. For example, the program may not take into account all of the constraints of the problem, or it may not produce the correct output even if it does take all of the constraints into account. If the logic of the program is incorrect, the program will not be able to solve the problem correctly and will produce an incorrect output.

**4. Runtime errors**

The program may contain runtime errors. For example, the program may attempt to divide by zero, or it may attempt to access a memory location that does not exist. If the program contains runtime errors, the program will not be able to complete execution and will produce an incorrect output.

**5. Unexpected errors**

The program may encounter unexpected errors. For example, the program may be interrupted by a system call, or it may be terminated by a user. If the program encounters an unexpected error, the program will not be able to complete execution and will produce an incorrect output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 505_A. Mr. Kitayuta's Gift

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly checking if a string is a palindrome.** A common mistake is to check if a string is a palindrome by simply reversing it and comparing it to the original string. This will not work if the string contains any non-alphabetic characters, such as spaces or punctuation marks.
2. **Not considering all possible ways to insert a letter into a string.** When inserting a letter into a string to make it a palindrome, you need to consider all possible positions where the letter could be inserted. For example, if the string is "abc", you could insert the letter "d" at any of the following positions: between "a" and "b", between "b" and "c", or at the end of the string.
3. **Not handling the case where the input string is already a palindrome.** If the input string is already a palindrome, you need to print the string as-is, without inserting any additional letters.
4. **Using a brute-force approach to find the solution.** A brute-force approach to solving this problem would involve trying every possible letter to insert into the string and checking if the resulting string is a palindrome. This approach is inefficient, as it will quickly become computationally expensive for long strings.
5. **Not using the most efficient data structures and algorithms.** There are more efficient ways to check if a string is a palindrome and to find the best position to insert a letter than the naive approaches described above. For example, you can use a hash table to store the characters in the string and check if the string is a palindrome by checking if the hash values of the first and last halves of the string are equal. You can also use a binary search to find the best position to insert a letter by repeatedly dividing the string in half and checking if the resulting substrings are palindromes.

By avoiding these common problems and bugs, you can write a more efficient and correct solution to this problem.

CODEFORCES 528_D. Fuzzy Search

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not very strict. For example, the input `10 4 1 AGCAATTCAT ACAT` is valid, even though it has an extra space between the second and third integers. This can lead to errors if the developer does not properly parse the input.
2. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. The problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ |T| ≤ |S| ≤ 200 000`, but the code should also handle the cases where `|T| = 0` or `|S| = 0`. Additionally, the problem statement specifies that `0 ≤ k ≤ 200 000`, but the code should also handle the case where `k < 0`.
3. **Incorrect use of dynamic programming**. The problem can be solved using dynamic programming, but the developer must be careful to correctly initialize the DP table and to correctly update the table as they iterate over the strings `S` and `T`.
4. **Incorrect use of the Boyer-Moore algorithm**. The Boyer-Moore algorithm can be used to find all occurrences of a pattern in a string, but the developer must be careful to correctly implement the algorithm and to correctly handle the case where the pattern does not occur in the string.
5. **Incorrect use of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm**. The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm can be used to find all occurrences of a pattern in a string, but the developer must be careful to correctly implement the algorithm and to correctly handle the case where the pattern does not occur in the string.
6. **Incorrect use of the Rabin-Karp algorithm**. The Rabin-Karp algorithm can be used to find all occurrences of a pattern in a string, but the developer must be careful to correctly implement the algorithm and to correctly handle the case where the pattern does not occur in the string.

CODEFORCES 698_A. Vacations

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format should be `n`, followed by a list of `n` integers. For example, `4`, `1 3 2 0`.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer, representing the minimum number of days Vasya will have a rest. For example, `2`.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic should be able to correctly determine the minimum number of days Vasya will have a rest, given the input. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
def solve(n, a):
  # This code is incorrect.
  return n
```

4. **Off-by-one errors.** Be careful when counting the number of days Vasya will have a rest. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
def solve(n, a):
  # This code is incorrect. It returns 1 day too many.
  count = 0
  for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == 0:
      count += 1
  return count
```

5. **Memory leaks.** Be careful not to create any memory leaks in your code. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
def solve(n, a):
  # This code creates a memory leak.
  days = []
  for i in range(n):
    days.append(a[i])
  return days
```

6. **Infinite loops.** Be careful not to create any infinite loops in your code. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
def solve(n, a):
  # This code creates an infinite loop.
  while True:
    pass
```

7. **Incorrect data types.** Be careful to use the correct data types in your code. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
def solve(n, a):
  # This code is incorrect. It uses the wrong data type for `n`.
  count = 0
  for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == 0:
      count += 1
  return count
```

8. **Incorrect variable names.** Be careful to use descriptive variable names in your code. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
def solve(n, a):
  # This code is incorrect. The variable `i` is not descriptive.
  for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == 0:
      count += 1
  return count
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 719_A. Vitya in the Countryside

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format specified in the problem statement is "The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 92) — the number of consecutive days Vitya was watching the size of the visible part of the moon. 

The second line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 15) — Vitya's records.". However, a developer may accidentally use a different input format, such as "The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 92) — the number of consecutive days Vitya was watching the size of the visible part of the moon. 

The second line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 15) — Vitya's records. The third line contains a single integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 92) — the number of consecutive days Vitya was watching the size of the visible part of the moon.". This would cause the program to crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format specified in the problem statement is "If Vitya can be sure that the size of visible part of the moon on day n + 1 will be less than the size of the visible part on day n, then print \"DOWN\" at the only line of the output. If he might be sure that the size of the visible part will increase, then print \"UP\". If it's impossible to determine what exactly will happen with the moon, print -1.". However, a developer may accidentally output the wrong format, such as "If Vitya can be sure that the size of visible part of the moon on day n + 1 will be less than the size of the visible part on day n, then print \"DOWN\" at the only line of the output. If he might be sure that the size of the visible part will increase, then print \"UP\". If it's impossible to determine what exactly will happen with the moon, print \"-1\".". This would cause the program to receive a incorrect verdict.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic of the program should be as follows:

1. Read the input data.
2. Check if the input data is valid.
3. Find the current day of the moon cycle.
4. If the current day is 15, then the moon will go down on the next day.
5. If the current day is not 15, then the moon will go up on the next day.
6. Print the output.

However, a developer may make a mistake in the logic, such as checking if the current day is 16 instead of 15. This would cause the program to output the wrong answer.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that occurs when a developer accidentally miscounts by one. For example, a developer may accidentally write the following code to find the current day of the moon cycle:

```
current_day = int(input()) - 1
```

This code would cause the program to output the wrong answer, because the current day of the moon cycle is actually one day later than the day that the developer entered.

**5. Using the wrong data type**

A developer may accidentally use the wrong data type for a variable, which can cause the program to crash or output the wrong answer. For example, a developer may accidentally declare the variable `current_day` as a string instead of an integer. This would cause the program to crash when it tries to subtract 1 from `current_day`.

**6. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the developer may try to solve the problem using a brute-force algorithm, which would be very inefficient.

**7. Not handling edge cases**

The developer may not handle edge cases correctly, which can cause the program to crash or output the wrong answer. For example, the developer may not handle the case where the input data is invalid.
Test inputs:
**1. Incorrect input format**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

**2. Incorrect output format**

```
n = int(input())

if a[n-1] < a[n]:
    print("DOWN")
elif a[n-1] > a[n]:
    print("UP")
else:
    print("-1")
```

**3. Incorrect logic**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
if a[n-1] == 15:
    print("DOWN")
else:
    print("UP")
```

**4. Off-by-one errors**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
current_day = int(input()) - 1
if current_day == 15:
    print("DOWN")
else:
    print("UP")
```

**5. Using the wrong data type**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
current_day = str(input()) - 1
if current_day == 15:
    print("DOWN")
else:
    print("UP")
```

**6. Using an incorrect algorithm**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] < a[i+1]:
        print("DOWN")
    else:
        print("UP")
```

**7. Not handling edge cases**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
if n == 0:
    print("-1")
else:
    if a[n-1] < a[n]:
        print("DOWN")
    elif a[n-1] > a[n]:
        print("UP")
    else:
        print("-1")
```
Title:
CODEFORCES 73_E. Morrowindows

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly parsed, which can lead to unexpected results. For example, if the input is "2 4 2 3", the program will attempt to parse the first two integers as n and x, but the third integer will be interpreted as ai, which will cause an error.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correctly formatted, which can make it difficult to read and understand. For example, if the output is "22", it is not clear whether this is the number of modes required or the number of items in the inventory.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program may contain errors in its logic, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may incorrectly assume that the number of items in the inventory is always less than or equal to x, which is not always the case.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program may not properly release memory that it has allocated, which can lead to a memory leak. This can eventually cause the program to crash or run out of memory.
5. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may contain security vulnerabilities, such as allowing a malicious user to execute arbitrary code. This can be a serious security risk, as it could allow an attacker to take control of the system.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design and test your program before deploying it to production. Here are some tips for debugging your program:

1. Use a debugger to step through your program and identify the source of the error.
2. Use unit tests to test your program's logic and ensure that it is working correctly.
3. Use static analysis tools to identify potential security vulnerabilities in your program.
4. Run your program on a variety of input data to ensure that it is robust and handles unexpected inputs gracefully.
5. Get feedback from other developers and testers to help you identify and fix any problems with your program.

Title:
CODEFORCES 763_C. Timofey and remoduling

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operation**

When working with modulo arithmetic, it is important to use the correct modulo operation. In this problem, we are given a prime number $m$ and we need to perform all operations modulo $m$. This means that we need to use the following modulo operation:

```
a % m
```

where $a$ is the number we want to modulo and $m$ is the modulo.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. The most efficient algorithm is the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. However, there are also other algorithms that can be used, such as the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

**3. Not handling special cases correctly**

There are a few special cases that need to be handled correctly when solving this problem. For example, if the sequence is empty, then there is no solution. Similarly, if the sequence contains only one element, then the only solution is to set the first element to 0 and the difference to 1.

**4. Making a mistake in the implementation**

Even if you have a good understanding of the problem and the algorithm, you can still make mistakes in the implementation. This is why it is important to carefully check your code before submitting it.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is always important to test your code before submitting it. This will help you to catch any mistakes that you may have made. You can test your code by using a variety of test cases, including both simple and complex cases.

CODEFORCES 923_F. Public Service

Pain points:
**1. Input format**

The first line contains an integer N (2 ≤ N ≤ 10000), the number of cities.

N - 1 lines follow, representing the network plan of Boblines. Each contains two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ N), meaning that there is a bus route between cities u and v.

N - 1 lines follow, representing the network plan of Bobrail. Each contains two integers u and v (N + 1 ≤ u, v ≤ 2N), meaning that there is a train route between cities u and v.

**2. Output format**

If there is no solution, output a single line with the word "No".

If a solution exists, output two lines. On the first line, there should be the word "Yes". On the second line, there should be N integers P1, P2, ..., PN (N + 1 ≤ Pi ≤ 2N) — the mapping between the two numbering schemes. More precisely, for i ≠ j it should be Pi ≠ Pj, and for every direct bus route (i, j), there is no direct train route between (Pi, Pj).

**3. Possible problems**

1. The input format is not correct. For example, the number of cities N is not an integer between 2 and 10000.
2. The input data is not correct. For example, there is a bus route between city 1 and city 2, but there is no train route between city 2 and city 3.
3. The output format is not correct. For example, the output does not contain the word "Yes" or the output does not contain N integers.
4. The solution is not correct. For example, there is a direct bus route between city 1 and city 2, but there is also a direct train route between city 1 and city 2.

**4. Possible bugs**

1. The developer may not correctly parse the input data. For example, the developer may not correctly convert the string "123" to the integer 123.
2. The developer may not correctly implement the algorithm to find a mapping between the two numbering schemes. For example, the developer may not correctly check if there is a direct bus route between city 1 and city 2, or if there is a direct train route between city 1 and city 2.
3. The developer may not correctly format the output data. For example, the developer may not correctly add a newline character to the end of the output.

**5. Solutions**

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input format and the output format. The developer should also carefully implement the algorithm to find a mapping between the two numbering schemes. Finally, the developer should carefully format the output data.

HACKEREARTH comparing-strings-1

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one errors.** When comparing two strings, it is easy to make a mistake and compare the first character of one string to the second character of the other string. This will result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect use of comparison operators.** The comparison operators `<` and `>` should only be used to compare two values of the same type. For example, you cannot compare a string to an integer.
3. **Incorrect use of logical operators.** The logical operators `&&` and `||` should only be used with boolean values. For example, you cannot use `&&` to compare two strings.
4. **Incorrect use of string functions.** The string functions `str.length()` and `str.charAt()` should only be used with strings. For example, you cannot use `str.length()` to get the length of an integer.
5. **Incorrect use of loops.** The loop `for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++)` should only be used to iterate over the characters in a string. For example, you cannot use this loop to iterate over the elements of an array.
6. **Incorrect use of exceptions.** The exception `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` should only be thrown when an attempt is made to access a character that is outside the bounds of a string. For example, you cannot use this exception to handle a divide-by-zero error.

HACKEREARTH fibonacci-madness

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the Fibonacci sequence. For example, they may forget to add the previous two numbers together to get the next number in the sequence.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may accidentally add or subtract one from a number in the Fibonacci sequence. This can cause the sequence to be incorrect.
3. **Index out of bounds error**. The developer may try to access an element of the Fibonacci sequence that is out of bounds. This can cause a runtime error.
4. **Memory leak**. The developer may not properly free the memory allocated for the Fibonacci sequence. This can cause the program to run out of memory.
5. **Incorrect data type**. The developer may use the wrong data type to store the Fibonacci numbers. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
6. **Format error**. The developer may not format the output of the Fibonacci sequence correctly. This can make it difficult for the user to understand the output.
7. **User input error**. The developer may not properly validate user input. This can allow the user to enter invalid data, which can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
8. **Security vulnerability**. The developer may not properly secure the Fibonacci sequence. This can allow an attacker to access or modify the sequence, which can have serious consequences.

Title:
HACKEREARTH ideal-random-number-generator

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of random number generator.** The problem statement specifies that the random number generator should generate any real number between 0 and the given integer. However, some developers may incorrectly use the random number generator to generate an integer between 0 and the given integer. This will result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the probability.** The probability that the sum of two random numbers is less than a given number can be calculated using the following formula:

```
P(X1 + X2 < C) = P(X1 < C - X2) = F(C - X2)
```

where F(x) is the cumulative distribution function of the random variable X. However, some developers may incorrectly calculate the probability using the following formula:

```
P(X1 + X2 < C) = P(X1 < C) * P(X2 < C)
```

This will also result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect rounding of the probability.** The probability that the sum of two random numbers is less than a given number is a real number. However, the problem statement requires the probability to be expressed in the form of P/Q, where P and Q are integers. To do this, the developer must round the probability to the nearest fraction. However, some developers may incorrectly round the probability to the nearest integer. This will also result in an incorrect answer.

Here are some tips to avoid these problems:

1. **Use the correct random number generator.** Make sure that the random number generator you are using is capable of generating any real number between 0 and the given integer.
2. **Calculate the probability correctly.** Use the correct formula to calculate the probability that the sum of two random numbers is less than a given number.
3. **Round the probability correctly.** Round the probability to the nearest fraction, not the nearest integer.

HACKEREARTH mario-and-queen

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain a string instead of an integer. The developer should check the input format and raise an error if it is incorrect.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correct. For example, the output may contain a string instead of an integer. The developer should check the output format and raise an error if it is incorrect.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm. For example, the algorithm may not find the optimal solution or it may not terminate in a finite amount of time. The developer should test the algorithm thoroughly to ensure that it is correct.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer may create memory leaks. Memory leaks can cause the program to run out of memory and crash. The developer should use a memory profiler to identify and fix memory leaks.
5. **Synchronization issues**. The developer may create synchronization issues. Synchronization issues can cause the program to deadlock or race condition. The developer should use locks and mutexes to ensure that the program is thread-safe.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer may introduce security vulnerabilities. Security vulnerabilities can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or its data. The developer should use secure coding practices to protect the program from security vulnerabilities.

Title:
HACKEREARTH number-maze

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect logic for checking divisibility.** The developer may incorrectly check for divisibility by 3 and 5 by using the following code:

```
if (num % 3 == 0 || num % 5 == 0) {
  // The number is divisible by 3 or 5.
}
```

This code will incorrectly identify numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5, such as 30, as divisible by only 3. To correctly check for divisibility by both 3 and 5, the developer can use the following code:

```
if (num % 3 == 0 && num % 5 == 0) {
  // The number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
}
```

2. **Incorrect handling of negative numbers.** The developer may incorrectly handle negative numbers by using the following code:

```
if (num < 0) {
  // The number is negative.
}
```

This code will incorrectly identify all negative numbers as divisible by 3 and 5, even if they are not. To correctly handle negative numbers, the developer can use the following code:

```
if (num < 0) {
  // The number is negative and should not be processed.
  continue;
}
```

3. **Incorrect handling of numbers that are not integers.** The developer may incorrectly handle numbers that are not integers by using the following code:

```
for (int i = num1; i <= num2; i++) {
  // The number i is processed.
}
```

This code will incorrectly process numbers that are not integers, such as 3.14159. To correctly handle numbers that are not integers, the developer can use the following code:

```
for (int i = num1; i <= num2; i++) {
  // The number i is converted to an integer before it is processed.
  int j = (int) i;
}
```

4. **Incorrect output format.** The developer may incorrectly format the output by using the following code:

```
System.out.println(num);
```

This code will output the number num on a single line. To correctly format the output, the developer can use the following code:

```
System.out.print(num + ",");
```

This code will output the number num followed by a comma.

Title:
HACKEREARTH quick-transaction

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input values can be very large, so it is important to use the correct data type to store them. For example, if the input values are integers, you should use the `int` data type. If the input values are floating-point numbers, you should use the `float` data type.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The most efficient algorithm for this problem is a greedy algorithm. A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that makes the best possible decision at each step, without considering the future. In this case, the best decision at each step is to use the largest denomination that is less than or equal to the remaining amount.

**3. Making a mistake in the implementation**

Once you have chosen the correct algorithm, it is important to implement it correctly. This means that you need to make sure that you are correctly handling all of the edge cases. For example, what happens if the input value is 0? What happens if the input value is negative?

**4. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code to make sure that it is correct. This means that you need to create some test cases and run your code on them. You should also make sure that your code is robust and handles all of the edge cases.

Title:
HACKEREARTH shil-and-square-sum-qualifier2

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type for the input or output**

The input and output of this problem are both integers. It is important to make sure that the data type you are using is large enough to hold the values of the input and output. For example, if you are using an integer data type with a maximum value of 2147483647, you will not be able to handle inputs or outputs larger than this value.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The correct algorithm for solving this problem is to use a dynamic programming approach. This means that you will need to create a table that stores the values of the square sum for each possible value of i and j. You can then use this table to find the value of the square sum for any given value of i.

**3. Making a mistake in your implementation**

Once you have chosen an algorithm for solving this problem, it is important to carefully implement it. This means that you need to make sure that you are correctly following the steps of the algorithm and that you are not making any mistakes in your code.

**4. Not handling edge cases correctly**

There are a few edge cases that you need to be aware of when solving this problem. For example, what happens if the value of K is greater than N? What happens if the value of A[i] is negative? You need to make sure that your code handles these edge cases correctly.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it to HackerRank. This will help you to catch any bugs in your code and make sure that it is correct. You can test your code using the following methods:

* Unit tests
* Integration tests
* System tests

By testing your code thoroughly, you can increase the likelihood that it will run correctly on HackerRank.

HACKEREARTH the-monk-and-class-marks

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is a list of students with their marks. The marks can be integers or strings. The developer may incorrectly assume that the marks are integers and try to sort them as integers. This will result in an incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect sorting order**. The problem statement states that the list should be sorted in decreasing order of marks. The developer may incorrectly sort the list in increasing order of marks. This will result in an incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect lexicographical order**. The problem statement states that if two students have the same marks, they should be arranged in lexicographical manner. The developer may incorrectly sort the list by the first character of the student's name. This will result in an incorrect output.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the index of the next student in the list. This will result in an incorrect output.
5. **Memory leak**. The developer may not release the memory allocated for the list of students after the program has finished running. This will cause a memory leak.
6. **Buffer overflow**. The developer may not allocate enough memory for the list of students. This will result in a buffer overflow.

ATCODER p02536 ACL Beginner Contest - Connect Cities

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Union Find data structure.** The Union Find data structure is a common tool for solving problems on graphs. It is used to track the connected components of a graph, and can be used to find the minimum number of edges that need to be added to connect all of the vertices in a graph. However, if the Union Find data structure is implemented incorrectly, it can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the Union Find data structure does not correctly handle cycles in the graph, it may incorrectly report that the graph is connected when it is not.
2. **Incorrect use of the Union Find data structure.** Even if the Union Find data structure is implemented correctly, it is still possible to use it incorrectly. For example, if the Union Find data structure is used to find the connected components of a graph, it is important to make sure that the graph is connected before using the Union Find data structure. If the graph is not connected, the Union Find data structure will not be able to find all of the connected components.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** When solving a problem on graphs, it is important to be aware of all of the possible edge cases. For example, if a graph contains a self-loop, the Union Find data structure will not be able to correctly find the connected components of the graph.
4. **Incorrect time complexity.** The time complexity of the Union Find data structure is important to consider when solving a problem on graphs. If the time complexity of the Union Find data structure is too high, it may not be able to solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time.
5. **Incorrect space complexity.** The space complexity of the Union Find data structure is also important to consider when solving a problem on graphs. If the space complexity of the Union Find data structure is too high, it may not be able to solve the problem in a reasonable amount of memory.

ATCODER p02667 NOMURA Programming Competition 2020 - Binary Programming

Pain points:
The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are as follows:

1. **Incorrectly counting the number of operations.** The problem states that Takahashi will do the operation with the following two steps |T| times. However, it is possible to make a mistake and count the number of operations incorrectly. For example, if T = "1101", then the number of operations is 3, not 4.
2. **Incorrectly computing the sum of the digits in the odd positions of S.** The problem states that Takahashi will increment x by the sum of the digits in the odd positions (first, third, fifth, ...) of S. However, it is possible to make a mistake and compute the sum of the digits incorrectly. For example, if S = "01101", then the sum of the digits in the odd positions is 2, not 3.
3. **Incorrectly updating the value of x.** The problem states that Takahashi will increment x by the sum of the digits in the odd positions of S. However, it is possible to make a mistake and update the value of x incorrectly. For example, if S = "01101", then the value of x should be incremented by 2, not 3.
4. **Incorrectly checking if S equals T.** The problem states that Takahashi will do the operation with the following two steps |T| times. However, it is possible to make a mistake and check if S equals T incorrectly. For example, if T = "1101" and S = "0111", then S does not equal T.

By following the steps outlined in this solution, you can avoid these common problems and bugs.

Title:
ATCODER p02796 Keyence Programming Contest 2020 - Robot Arms

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm.** The greedy algorithm for this problem works by iteratively removing the robot with the smallest range of motion until no two robots' ranges intersect. However, if the robots are not sorted by their ranges of motion, the greedy algorithm may not find the optimal solution.
2. **Incorrect handling of ties.** If two robots have the same range of motion, the greedy algorithm must break the tie arbitrarily. If the tie is not broken correctly, the greedy algorithm may not find the optimal solution.
3. **Incorrect handling of degenerate cases.** The greedy algorithm may not work correctly in some degenerate cases, such as when all of the robots have the same range of motion or when all of the robots' ranges of motion intersect.
4. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The greedy algorithm requires a data structure to store the robots and their ranges of motion. If the data structure is not implemented correctly, the greedy algorithm may not find the optimal solution.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The greedy algorithm may encounter errors, such as invalid input or out-of-memory errors. If the errors are not handled correctly, the greedy algorithm may not find the optimal solution or may even crash.

Title:
AIZU p00221 FizzBuzz

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input handling**. The input format is not very strict, so it is easy to make mistakes when reading the input. For example, if the number of players is not a positive integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect output handling**. The output format is also not very strict, so it is easy to make mistakes when writing the output. For example, if the output is not in ascending order, the program may not be correct.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program is not very complicated, but it is easy to make mistakes. For example, if the player who is supposed to speak next has already dropped out, the program may crash.
4. **Incorrect error handling**. The program should handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input file does not exist, the program should print an error message and exit.
5. **Incorrect performance**. The program should be efficient. For example, it should not take too long to run on a large input file.

Title:
AIZU p00383 Points on a Straight Line

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data is given in the format of `N K x1 y1 x2 y2 ... xn yn`, where `N` and `K` are integers, and `x` and `y` are real numbers. If the developer uses incorrect data types, such as `int` for `K` or `float` for `x` and `y`, the program will not work correctly.

**2. Using incorrect algorithms**

The problem can be solved using the following algorithm:

1. Sort the points by their x-coordinates.
2. For each point, check if it is collinear with the previous `K-1` points.
3. If any point is collinear with the previous `K-1` points, output `1`. Otherwise, output `0`.

If the developer uses an incorrect algorithm, the program will not work correctly.

**3. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

The problem statement specifies that `3 <= N <= 3000` and `3 <= K <= N`. If the developer does not check these boundary conditions, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

**4. Using incorrect error handling**

The program should handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input data is incorrect, the program should output an error message and exit.

**5. Using insecure coding practices**

The program should not contain any security vulnerabilities. For example, the program should not accept input from untrusted sources, and it should not store sensitive data in plaintext.

**6. Using poor performance**

The program should be efficient. For example, the program should not use a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem.

**7. Using bad design**

The program should be well-designed. For example, the program should be easy to read and understand, and it should be modularized.

AIZU p01447 Earth Invasion Diary of Miyabi-sensei

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect data type:** The input N is an integer, but the developer may accidentally treat it as a string. This would cause the program to crash.
* **Off-by-one error:** The developer may accidentally compare the weights of two Draculas in the wrong order, which would result in the wrong Dracula being identified as the original.
* **Infinite loop:** The developer may not properly check for the end of the input, which could cause the program to enter an infinite loop.
* **Memory leak:** The developer may not properly free up memory after using it, which could eventually lead to a memory leak.
* **Security vulnerability:** The developer may not properly protect the program from malicious input, which could allow an attacker to gain access to the program's data or even execute arbitrary code.

**Additional notes:**

* The developer should be aware of the following constraints when solving this problem:
    * The number of Draculas, N, is between 2 and 2,000,000,000.
    * The original Dracula is heavier than all of the fake Draculas.
    * The developer must find the original Dracula using the balance in the worst case.
* The developer should use the following algorithm to solve this problem:
    1. Divide the Draculas into two groups of equal size.
    2. Weigh the two groups of Draculas on the balance.
    3. If the original Dracula is in the heavier group, then the original Dracula is in the left-hand plate. Otherwise, the original Dracula is in the right-hand plate.
    4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the original Dracula is found.

This algorithm will find the original Dracula in the worst case in O(log N) time.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correct. For example, the input may not have the correct number of elements, or the elements may not be in the correct format.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correct. For example, the output may not have the correct number of elements, or the elements may not be in the correct format.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program is incorrect. For example, the program may not be able to solve the problem correctly, or the program may crash.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program may leak memory. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.

Title:
AIZU p01893 Lost Graph

Pain points:
**1. Incorrectly counting the number of edges**

When checking whether there exists a directed graph that satisfies the given conditions, it is important to correctly count the number of edges. For example, in the following input, the number of edges from vertex 1 to vertex 2 is 2, not 1.

```
3
1 2 0 0
1 2 0 0
```

**2. Forgetting to check the input constraints**

The input constraints for this problem are $1 \leq n \leq 50$ and $0 \leq a_i \leq n$ and $0 \leq b_i \leq n$. It is important to check these constraints before proceeding with the rest of the solution. For example, the following input violates the constraint that $n \leq 50$.

```
51
1 2 0 0
1 2 0 0
```

**3. Using incorrect data types**

The input and output of this problem are lists of integers. It is important to use the correct data types when storing and processing these lists. For example, the following code will not work correctly because the input list is being stored as a list of strings, not a list of integers.

```
n = int(input())
a = list(input())
b = list(input())

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        if a[i] + b[j] != 1:
            print("NO")
            exit()

print("YES")
for i in range(n):
    print(*[int(x) for x in a[i].split()])
```

**4. Misunderstanding the problem statement**

The problem statement states that there is a directed graph of the $N$ vertices. This means that there is a directed edge from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$ if and only if $e_{ij} = 1$. For example, in the following graph, $e_{12} = 1$ and $e_{21} = 0$.

```
1 -> 2
```

**5. Making incorrect assumptions**

When solving this problem, it is important to avoid making incorrect assumptions. For example, the following code will not work correctly because it assumes that the input list is always in the same order.

```
n = int(input())
a = list(input())
b = list(input())

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        if a[i] + b[j] != 1:
            print("NO")
            exit()

print("YES")
for i in range(n):
    print(*[int(x) for x in a[i].split()])
```

**6. Using inefficient algorithms**

The problem statement does not specify a time limit, but it is still important to use efficient algorithms when solving this problem. For example, the following algorithm is inefficient because it uses a nested for loop to iterate over all pairs of vertices.

```
n = int(input())
a = list(input())
b = list(input())

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        if a[i] + b[j] != 1:
            print("NO")
            exit()

print("YES")
for i in range(n):
    print(*[int(x) for x in a[i].split()])
```

A more efficient algorithm would be to use a hash table to store the number of edges from each vertex to each other vertex. This would allow us to check whether there exists a directed edge from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$ in constant time.

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correct. For example, the number of planets $N$ and the number of bridges $M$ are not separated by a space.
* **Incorrect data type:** The input data is not of the correct data type. For example, the coordinates of a planet are not integers.
* **Incorrect number of bridges:** The number of bridges in the input is not equal to the number of bridges in the output.
* **Incorrect distance calculation:** The distance between two planets is not calculated correctly. For example, the distance between two planets is calculated as the absolute value of the difference between their x-coordinates, instead of the sum of the absolute values of the differences between their x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and z-coordinates.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correct. For example, the output does not contain the maximum distance from each planet to all other planets.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems and bugs:

* **Check the input format carefully:** Make sure that the input format is correct before you start writing your code.

Title:
AIZU p02313 Area of Intersection between Two Circles

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect calculation of distance between the centers of the circles.** The distance between the centers of the circles is calculated as follows:

```
d = sqrt((c1x - c2x)**2 + (c1y - c2y)**2)
```

However, this formula is only correct if the circles are not overlapping. If the circles are overlapping, the distance between their centers will be less than the sum of their radii, and the area of intersection will be greater than zero.

2. **Incorrect calculation of the area of intersection of the circles.** The area of intersection of two circles is calculated as follows:

```
A = π * (r1 * r2) * cos(θ)
```

where `r1` and `r2` are the radii of the circles, and `θ` is the angle between the circles. However, this formula is only correct if the circles are not overlapping. If the circles are overlapping, the area of intersection will be greater than zero, but it will not be equal to the formula above.

3. **Incorrect rounding of the area of intersection.** The area of intersection of two circles is a floating-point number. When printing the area of intersection, it is important to round the number to the correct number of decimal places.

4. **Incorrect input handling.** The input to the problem is given in the following format:

```
c1x c1y c1r
c2x c2y c2r
```

where `c1x`, `c1y`, and `c1r` are the coordinates and radius of the first circle, and `c2x`, `c2y`, and `c2r` are the coordinates and radius of the second circle. It is important to check that the input is valid before attempting to calculate the area of intersection.

5. **Incorrect output formatting.** The output of the problem should be a single floating-point number, representing the area of intersection of the two circles. The number should be rounded to the correct number of decimal places.
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect calculation of distance between the centers of the circles.**

```
c1x = 0
c1y = 0
c1r = 1
c2x = 2
c2y = 0
c2r = 2
```

The correct answer should be 1.40306643968573875104, but the following implementation returns 0:

```
import math

c1x = int(input())
c1y = int(input())
c1r = int(input())
c2x = int(input())
c2y = int(input())
c2r = int(input())

d = math.sqrt((c1x - c2x)**2 + (c1y - c2y)**2)

if d > c1r + c2r:
    print(0)
else:
    print(d)
```

2. **Incorrect calculation of the area of intersection of the circles.**

```
c1x = 0
c1y = 0
c1r = 1
c2x = 1
c2y = 0
c2r = 1
```

The correct answer should be 0.5, but the following implementation returns 1:

```
import math

c1x = int(input())
c1y = int(input())
c1r = int(input())
c2x = int(input())
c2y = int(input())
c2r = int(input())

d = math.sqrt((c1x - c2x)**2 + (c1y - c2y)**2)

if d > c1r + c2r:
    print(0)
else:
    print(math.pi * (c1r * c2r) * math.cos(math.atan2(c1y - c2y, c1x - c2x)))
```

3. **Incorrect rounding of the area of intersection.**

```
c1x = 0
c1y = 0
c1r = 1
c2x = 2
c2y = 0
c2r = 2
```

The correct answer should be 1.40306643968573875104, but the following implementation returns 1.4030664396857387510400000000:

```

c1x = int(input())
c1y = int(input())
c1r = int(input())
c2x = int(input())
c2y = int(input())
c2r = int(input())

d = math.sqrt((c1x - c2x)**2 + (c1y - c2y)**2)

if d > c1r + c2r:
    print(0)
else:
    print(math.pi * (c1r * c2r) * math.cos(math.atan2(c1y - c2y, c1x - c2x)))
