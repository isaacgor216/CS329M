Title:
CODECHEF astrgame

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly using the dictionary.** The dictionary is a set of strings, and each string can only be used once. If a player incorrectly uses the dictionary, they may lose the game even if they could have won.
2. **Not considering all possible substrings.** When a player erases a substring, the remaining substring may become separated into multiple pieces. A player must consider all possible substrings that can be erased, even if they are not contiguous.
3. **Misunderstanding the rules of the game.** The rules of the game are complex, and it is easy to make mistakes. For example, a player cannot erase a substring that occurs partially to the left of another substring that has already been erased.
4. **Implementing the game incorrectly.** The game is implemented in a recursive function, and it is easy to make mistakes in the recursion. For example, a player may accidentally erase a substring that they did not intend to erase.
5. **Not handling errors correctly.** The game may throw errors if the input is invalid. For example, the input may contain a string that is not in the dictionary. A player must handle these errors correctly, or they may lose the game.

By following these tips, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
CODECHEF flow005

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for N.** If N is a large number, it may be necessary to use a data type such as `long` or `unsigned long` to avoid overflow errors.
2. **Not considering the order of the denominations.** The optimal solution may not be to use the largest denomination first. For example, if N is 11, it is better to use two 5s and one 1 than one 10 and one 1.
3. **Not using a greedy algorithm.** A greedy algorithm can often be used to find the optimal solution to this problem. A greedy algorithm works by making locally optimal decisions at each step. In this case, the locally optimal decision is to use the largest denomination that is less than or equal to N.
4. **Using an incorrect formula for the number of notes.** The number of notes of denomination d that are needed to make N is N / d, rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if N is 11, the number of 5s needed is 11 / 5 = 2.
5. **Not handling negative values of N.** The problem statement specifies that N must be non-negative. If N is negative, an error should be thrown.

Title:
CODECHEF lediv

Pain points:
**1. Using a brute force approach**

A brute force approach would be to iterate over all numbers from 2 to the largest element in the array, and for each number, check if it is a divisor of all elements in the array. This approach would be very inefficient, as it would require O(N * max(A)) time, where N is the number of elements in the array and max(A) is the largest element in the array.

**2. Using a greedy approach**

A greedy approach would be to start with the smallest element in the array, and repeatedly multiply it by 2 until it is a divisor of all elements in the array. This approach would be more efficient than the brute force approach, as it would only require O(N) time. However, it is still possible that this approach will not find a divisor of all elements in the array.

**3. Using a divide and conquer approach**

A divide and conquer approach would be to recursively divide the array into two halves, and then find the least common multiple of the divisors of the two halves. This approach would be the most efficient, as it would only require O(log(N)) time. However, it is more complex to implement than the other two approaches.

**4. Using a mathematical approach**

A mathematical approach would be to use the Chinese remainder theorem to find the least common multiple of all elements in the array. This approach would be the most elegant, but it is also the most difficult to implement.

**5. Using a probabilistic approach**

A probabilistic approach would be to randomly generate a number, and then check if it is a divisor of all elements in the array. If it is not, then generate another number and repeat. This approach would be very inefficient, but it is possible that it would find a divisor of all elements in the array eventually.

**6. Using a heuristic approach**

A heuristic approach would be to use a combination of the different approaches discussed above, in order to try to find a divisor of all elements in the array as quickly as possible. This approach would be the most practical, as it would be a compromise between efficiency and accuracy.

**7. Using a hybrid approach**

A hybrid approach would be to use a combination of the different approaches discussed above, in order to try to find a divisor of all elements in the array as efficiently as possible, while still maintaining a high degree of accuracy. This approach would be the most comprehensive, as it would combine the strengths of the different approaches.

Title:
CODECHEF potatoes

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the minimum number of potatoes that need to be harvested from the third field. For example, if the farmer harvested 1 potato from the first field and 3 potatoes from the second field, the sum is 4. If he is able to harvest a potato from the third field, that will make the sum 5, which is not prime. Hence, the answer is 2 (he needs two more potatoes to make the sum of harvested potatoes prime).
2. **Incorrect data type**. The developer may incorrectly use the wrong data type to store the number of potatoes harvested from each field. For example, if the farmer harvested 1000 potatoes from the first field and 1000 potatoes from the second field, the sum is 2000. If he is able to harvest a potato from the third field, that will make the sum 2001, which is not prime. Hence, the answer is 4 (he needs four more potatoes to make the sum of harvested potatoes prime).
3. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the number of potatoes that need to be harvested from the third field by one. For example, if the farmer harvested 1 potato from the first field and 3 potatoes from the second field, the sum is 4. If he is able to harvest a potato from the third field, that will make the sum 5, which is prime. Hence, the answer is 1 (he needs one more potato to make the sum of harvested potatoes prime).

Title:
CODECHEF subinc

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input and output data types are not specified in the problem statement. A developer may incorrectly assume that the input and output are integers, when in fact they are strings. This could lead to incorrect results.

**2. Using incorrect algorithms**

The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach. A developer may incorrectly use a brute force approach, which would be much slower.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

The problem statement specifies that the subarrays must be non-decreasing. A developer may incorrectly count subarrays that are not non-decreasing, or vice versa.

**4. Memory errors**

The problem statement does not specify the maximum size of the input array. A developer may incorrectly allocate too much memory, or not enough memory, which could lead to runtime errors.

**5. Incorrect edge cases**

The problem statement does not specify any edge cases. A developer may incorrectly handle edge cases, which could lead to incorrect results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1033_B. Square Difference

Pain points:
### 1. **Incorrect input format**.

The input format for this problem is `t a b`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `a` is the side length of Alice's square, and `b` is the side length of the square that Bob wants. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

For example, if the input is `6 5 13`, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will output an incorrect answer.

### 2. **Incorrect output format**.

The output format for this problem is `YES` or `NO`, depending on whether the area of the remaining piece of cloth is prime. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

For example, if the output is `yes`, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

### 3. **Incorrect calculation of the area of the remaining piece of cloth**.

The area of the remaining piece of cloth is `a^2 - b^2`. If the program incorrectly calculates the area of the remaining piece of cloth, it will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

For example, if the program calculates the area of the remaining piece of cloth as `a^2 + b^2`, it will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

### 4. **Incorrect check for primality**.

The program must check if the area of the remaining piece of cloth is prime. If the program incorrectly checks for primality, it will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

For example, if the program incorrectly checks for primality by dividing the number by 2, it will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

### 5. **Other bugs**

There are a number of other potential bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:

* Using incorrect data types
* Using incorrect algorithms
* Making incorrect assumptions
* Not handling errors correctly

By carefully considering these potential problems, developers can write code that is more likely to be correct.

CODEFORCES 1078_A. Barcelonian Distance

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the input will be interpreted incorrectly.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the distance.** The distance between two points can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. However, it's important to remember that the diagonal avenue is a special case, and the distance between two points on the avenue is not the same as the distance between two points on a regular street.
3. **Floating-point errors.** When calculating the distance between two points, it's important to use floating-point arithmetic. However, floating-point arithmetic is not exact, and it's possible to get rounding errors. To avoid this, you can use the `round()` function to round the distance to the nearest decimal place.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The output format for this problem is very specific. You need to output the distance to the nearest decimal place. For example, if the distance is 4.2426406871, you should output 4.24.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

1. **Be careful when reading the input.** Make sure to read the input carefully and make sure that you understand the format.
2. **Double-check your calculations.** Make sure that you've calculated the distance correctly.
3. **Use floating-point arithmetic.** Floating-point arithmetic is necessary for calculating the distance between two points.
4. **Round the distance to the nearest decimal place.** Make sure to round the distance to the nearest decimal place before outputting it.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

CODEFORCES 1146_E. Hot is Cold

Pain points:
 1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be two integers n,q (1 ≤ n,q ≤ 10^5) — the number of integers and the number of queries, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (-10^5 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^5) — the numbers, and each of the next q lines contains a character and an integer s_i, x_i. (s_i ∈ \{<, >\}, -10^5 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^5) – the queries.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be n integers c_1, c_2, …, c_n representing the array after all operations.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The code may not calculate the final array correctly. For example, the code may not consider all the queries, or it may make a mistake in the calculation of the new array.
4. **Memory leak**. The code may not release the memory allocated for the intermediate results, which may lead to a memory leak.
5. **Time complexity**. The code may have a time complexity that is too high. For example, the code may iterate over the array multiple times, or it may use a sorting algorithm that has a high time complexity.
6. **Space complexity**. The code may use too much space. For example, the code may create a new array that is larger than necessary, or it may use a data structure that has a high space complexity.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem states that the first line should contain two integers n and x, and the second line should contain n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect use of data structures**. The problem requires the use of a data structure to store the input array and to perform the required operations. If the wrong data structure is used, the program may not be able to perform the required operations efficiently or may even crash.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**. The algorithm for solving this problem is relatively simple, but it is important to implement it correctly in order to achieve the best possible performance. If the algorithm is implemented incorrectly, the program may not be able to solve the problem in time or may even produce incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. The problem statement specifies a few edge cases that must be handled correctly. If these edge cases are not handled correctly, the program may not be able to solve the problem correctly or may even crash.
5. **Incorrect debugging**. If the program is not producing the correct output, it is important to be able to debug the program and identify the source of the error. This can be difficult, but it is essential in order to fix the problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1185_G2. Playlist for Polycarp (hard version)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data types of the input and output values must match the ones specified in the problem statement. For example, if the input values are integers, the output values must also be integers.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. These errors occur when the programmer forgets to account for the first or last element in an array or list. For example, if the programmer is counting the number of elements in an array, they may forget to include the first element in the count.
4. **Indexing errors**. These errors occur when the programmer accesses an element in an array or list using an invalid index. For example, if the programmer tries to access the element at index 5 in an array that only has 4 elements, this will cause an error.
5. **Arithmetic errors**. These errors occur when the programmer performs an arithmetic operation incorrectly. For example, if the programmer tries to divide by zero, this will cause an error.
6. **Logical errors**. These errors occur when the programmer's code does not produce the desired output. For example, if the programmer is trying to find the maximum value in an array, but their code returns the minimum value instead, this is a logical error.
7. **Memory errors**. These errors occur when the programmer allocates too much or too little memory for a variable or data structure. For example, if the programmer allocates an array with a size that is too small, this will cause a memory error.
8. **Timeout errors**. These errors occur when the programmer's code takes too long to run. For example, if the programmer's code is trying to solve a problem that is computationally difficult, this could cause a timeout error.
9. **Security errors**. These errors occur when the programmer's code is vulnerable to attack. For example, if the programmer's code allows a malicious user to access sensitive data, this is a security error.
10. **Other errors**. There are many other possible errors that a programmer may encounter when solving a problem. These errors can be caused by a variety of factors, such as incorrect assumptions, incorrect implementation, or simply bad luck.

CODEFORCES 1204_E. Natasha, Sasha and the Prefix Sums

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is two integers n and m, separated by a space. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce an incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the maximal prefix sum**

The maximal prefix sum is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of the input array. To calculate the maximal prefix sum, we need to iterate over all possible subarrays and find the one with the maximum sum. This can be done using a dynamic programming approach.

**3. Incorrect modulo operation**

The output of the program must be modulo 998\: 244\: 853. If the output is not modulo, the program will produce an incorrect answer.

**4. Overflow**

The numbers in the input can be very large, so it is important to use a data type that can represent them without overflowing. In this problem, we can use the `long long` data type to represent the numbers.

**5. Runtime error**

The program must run in a reasonable amount of time. If the program takes too long to run, it will be timed out and will not produce an output.

**6. Memory error**

The program must not use too much memory. If the program uses too much memory, it will be killed by the operating system and will not produce an output.

**7. Incorrect output format**

The output of the program must be in the following format:

```

Title:
CODEFORCES 1221_D. Make The Fence Great Again

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correctly parsed by the compiler. This can lead to errors such as "unexpected end of input" or "invalid character". To avoid this, make sure that the input format is correct and that all required fields are present.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also important. The compiler will not accept incorrect output, and your program will not compile. Make sure that the output format is correct and that all required fields are present.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a fence that is not great even though it should be. To avoid off-by-one errors, be careful to increment and decrement variables correctly.

**4. Arithmetic errors**

Arithmetic errors can occur when a programmer makes a mistake in their calculations. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a fence that is great even though it should not be. To avoid arithmetic errors, be careful to check your calculations and make sure that they are correct.

**5. Memory errors**

Memory errors can occur when a programmer allocates too much or too little memory. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a fence that is great even though it should not be. To avoid memory errors, be careful to allocate the correct amount of memory for your program.

**6. Logical errors**

Logical errors are a type of error that occurs when a programmer makes a mistake in their logic. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a fence that is great even though it should not be. To avoid logical errors, be careful to check your logic and make sure that it is correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1418_E. Expected Damage

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the dynamic programming algorithm**

The dynamic programming algorithm for this problem is relatively straightforward. However, it is important to implement it correctly, as a bug in the implementation could lead to incorrect results.

One common mistake is to forget to update the values of the dp array when a new monster is encountered. This can lead to the algorithm incorrectly calculating the expected damage for the current shield.

Another common mistake is to use the wrong modulo operator when calculating the expected damage. The expected damage should be calculated modulo 998244353, but some programmers may accidentally use a different modulo operator, which will lead to incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

The input for this problem may contain some edge cases, such as a monster with strength 0 or a shield with durability 0. It is important to handle these edge cases correctly, as a bug in their handling could lead to incorrect results.

For example, if a monster has strength 0, then the expected damage for any shield is 0. However, if a shield has durability 0, then the expected damage for any monster is undefined. It is important to handle this case correctly by returning a special value, such as -1.

**3. Incorrect use of data structures**

The input for this problem may contain a large number of monsters and shields. It is important to use data structures that are efficient for storing and accessing this data.

For example, the input can be stored in a vector of integers. The monsters can be sorted by their strength, which will make it easier to iterate over them in the dynamic programming algorithm. The shields can be stored in a hash table, which will make it easy to look up the expected damage for a given shield.

**4. Incorrect use of mathematical operations**

The expected damage for a given shield is a fraction of the form x/y, where x and y are integers. It is important to perform the mathematical operations on these fractions correctly, as a bug in their implementation could lead to incorrect results.

For example, the expected damage should be calculated as x * y^-1 mod 998244353. However, some programmers may accidentally calculate it as x / y mod 998244353, which will lead to incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect use of the modulo operator**

The expected damage for a given shield is a fraction of the form x/y, where x and y are integers. It is important to use the modulo operator correctly when calculating this fraction, as a bug in its implementation could lead to incorrect results.

For example, the expected damage should be calculated as x * y^-1 mod 998244353. However, some programmers may accidentally calculate it as x * y^-1 % 998244353, which will lead to incorrect results.

CODEFORCES 1436_D. Bandit in a City

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type.** The input data is a string, but the program expects an integer. This can be fixed by using the `int()` function to convert the string to an integer.
2. **Incorrect index.** The program tries to access the element at index `n` in the array `a`, but the array only has `n - 1` elements. This can be fixed by checking that `n` is greater than or equal to 2 before accessing the element at index `n`.
3. **Off-by-one error.** The program counts the number of citizens on the square where the bandit is located, but it should not count the bandit himself. This can be fixed by subtracting 1 from the number of citizens on the square where the bandit is located.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The program assumes that the citizens will always split into two groups of equal size. This is not always the case, and the program will not always find the optimal solution. To fix this, the program needs to be modified to consider all possible ways that the citizens can split into groups.
5. **Memory leak.** The program does not free the memory that it allocates for the arrays `a` and `b`. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash. To fix this, the program needs to call the `free()` function to free the memory that it allocates for the arrays `a` and `b`.

CODEFORCES 1536_E. Omkar and Forest

Pain points:
**Possible Problems**

* **Incorrectly handling the input data.** The input data can be quite large, so it is important to make sure that you are correctly reading it in and storing it in memory.
* **Incorrectly calculating the number of valid configurations.** The number of valid configurations can be quite large, so it is important to make sure that you are correctly calculating it.
* **Using incorrect modulo arithmetic.** The modulo operator (%) is used to perform division with remainder. It is important to make sure that you are using the modulo operator correctly, especially when the numbers involved are large.
* **Incorrectly handling overflow.** When dealing with large numbers, it is important to make sure that you are not overflowing the integer data type.
* **Incorrectly handling boundary conditions.** The input data may contain boundary conditions that you need to handle correctly.

**Possible Bugs**

* **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over an array or a range of numbers, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. This can lead to incorrect results.
* **Incorrectly using pointers.** Pointers can be a source of bugs if they are not used correctly. Make sure that you are initializing pointers correctly and that you are dereferencing them correctly.
* **Incorrectly using floating-point numbers.** Floating-point numbers are not always precise, so it is important to make sure that you are using them correctly.
* **Incorrectly using recursion.** Recursion can be a powerful tool, but it is also a source of bugs. Make sure that you are correctly defining your recursive functions and that you are handling the base cases correctly.

**How to Avoid These Problems**

To avoid these problems, it is important to:

* Carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand the input and output formats.
* Write unit tests to verify that your code is correct.
* Use a debugger to step through your code and identify any errors.

Title:
CODEFORCES 329_E. Evil

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input specifies that the coordinates of the cities are integers in the range [0, 10^9]. However, if you use a data type that is too small, such as int, you may get incorrect results. For example, if you use int to store the coordinates of a city with x-coordinate 10^9, the value will be truncated to 2147483647, which is less than the actual value. This can lead to incorrect results when computing the distance between two cities.

**2. Using the wrong formula to compute the distance between two cities**

The Manhattan distance between two cities (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. However, some developers may mistakenly use the Euclidean distance, which is sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2). This can lead to incorrect results, especially when the cities are far apart.

**3. Not considering the wraparound effect**

The input specifies that the cities are on a two-dimensional Cartesian plane. This means that the x- and y-coordinates of a city can be negative. However, some developers may mistakenly assume that the x- and y-coordinates of a city are always non-negative. This can lead to incorrect results when computing the distance between two cities.

**4. Not handling the case where there is no Hamiltonian cycle**

The problem statement states that there exists a Hamiltonian cycle for the given cities. However, it is possible that there is no Hamiltonian cycle for a given set of cities. In this case, the developer should return -1 as the output.

**5. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved in O(n^2) time using a brute-force algorithm. However, there are more efficient algorithms that can be used to solve the problem in O(n log n) time. Using a more efficient algorithm can lead to a significant improvement in performance.
Test inputs:

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of operations is not a positive integer, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may not be able to find the shortest possible sequence of operations to destroy all bombs.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program may not properly release memory after it is no longer needed, which can lead to a memory leak. This can eventually cause the program to crash.
5. **Race conditions**. The program may not be thread-safe, which can lead to incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.
6. **Deadlocks**. The program may deadlock, which means that it will stop responding and will not be able to continue execution. This can happen if two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock.
7. **Stack overflows**. The program may overflow the stack, which means that it will run out of memory and will crash. This can happen if the program recursively calls itself too many times.
8. **Buffer overflows**. The program may overflow a buffer, which means that it will write data outside of the allocated memory. This can lead to security vulnerabilities.
9. **Format string vulnerabilities**. The program may use format strings incorrectly, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.
10. **SQL injection vulnerabilities**. The program may not properly escape SQL queries, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully follow the input and output formats, use correct logic, and avoid memory leaks, race conditions, deadlocks, stack overflows, buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and SQL injection vulnerabilities.

2. **Incorrect variable declaration.** The variables used in the program must be declared correctly, or the program may not work as expected. For example, if a variable is declared as the wrong type, or if it is not initialized, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program must be correct, or the program may not produce the desired output. For example, if the program does not correctly check for errors in the input, or if it does not correctly update the state of the program, the output may be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect use of functions.** The functions used in the program must be used correctly, or the program may not work as expected. For example, if a function is called with the wrong arguments, or if the function is not called in the correct order, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The program must handle errors correctly, or the program may crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the program encounters an error that it cannot handle, it may crash or produce incorrect output.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully follow the input format, correctly declare variables, use functions correctly, and handle errors correctly. Additionally, it is important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it produces the desired output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 445_E. DZY Loves Colors

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correct. For example, the input `2 1` is not correct because it does not have enough space between the two numbers.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not always correct. For example, the output `123` is not correct because it does not have a newline character at the end.

**3. Index out of bounds**

When iterating over an array, it is important to make sure that the index is not out of bounds. For example, the following code would cause an index out of bounds error:

```
for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
  // Do something with array[i]
}
```

**4. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a programmer forgets to add or subtract one when calculating an index. For example, the following code would cause an off-by-one error:

```
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
  sum += array[i];
}
```

The correct code would be:

```
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < array.length - 1; i++) {
  sum += array[i];
}
```

**5. Using the wrong data type**

It is important to use the correct data type for each variable. For example, the following code would cause a compile-time error because `x` is declared as an integer, but `y` is declared as a float:

```
int x = 10;
float y = x;
```

The correct code would be:

```
int x = 10;
float y = (float)x;
```

**6. Using uninitialized variables**

It is important to initialize all variables before using them. For example, the following code would cause a runtime error because `x` is uninitialized:

```
int x;
System.out.println(x);
```

The correct code would be:

```
int x = 10;
System.out.println(x);
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 568_C. New Language

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that the input is formatted correctly, or the program will not be able to process it correctly. For example, if the input contains a space between two letters, the program will not be able to correctly identify the letters as vowels or consonants.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem must be in the correct format. The output must be a single string of characters, and it must not contain any spaces or other punctuation. For example, if the correct answer is "abc", the output must be "abc" and not "abc " or "abc."

**3. Incorrect use of variables**

It is important to use variables correctly in this problem. For example, if you try to use a variable that has not been initialized, the program will not be able to compile. Similarly, if you try to use a variable that has been declared but not initialized, the program will not be able to run correctly.

**4. Incorrect logic**

The logic for this problem is fairly straightforward. However, it is important to make sure that the logic is correct. For example, if you try to compare two strings using the `==` operator, the program will not be able to correctly identify whether the strings are equal or not.

**5. Incorrect use of functions**

The functions that you use in this problem must be used correctly. For example, if you try to call a function that does not exist, the program will not be able to compile. Similarly, if you try to call a function with the wrong number of arguments, the program will not be able to run correctly.

**6. Incorrect use of data structures**

The data structures that you use in this problem must be used correctly. For example, if you try to add an element to a list that is full, the program will not be able to correctly add the element. Similarly, if you try to remove an element from a list that is empty, the program will not be able to correctly remove the element.

Title:
CODEFORCES 706_A. Beru-taxi

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type for distance calculation**

The distance between two points can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:

```
distance = sqrt( (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 )
```

However, if the coordinates of the points are of type `int`, the result of the calculation will also be of type `int`. This can lead to rounding errors, which can cause the final answer to be incorrect.

To avoid this problem, the coordinates of the points should be of type `float`.

**2. Incorrect data type for time calculation**

The time it takes for a taxi to travel from one point to another can be calculated using the following formula:

```
time = distance / speed
```

If the distance and speed are of type `int`, the result of the calculation will also be of type `int`. This can lead to rounding errors, which can cause the final answer to be incorrect.

To avoid this problem, the distance and speed should be of type `float`.

**3. Using the wrong formula for time calculation**

The formula for calculating the time it takes for a taxi to travel from one point to another is:

```
time = distance / speed
```

However, some developers mistakenly use the following formula:

```
time = distance * speed
```

This formula will give the wrong answer, because it is calculating the distance traveled, not the time.

**4. Using the wrong units for distance and speed**

The distance between two points is measured in units of length, such as meters or kilometers. The speed of a taxi is measured in units of speed, such as meters per second or kilometers per hour.

If the distance and speed are not in the same units, the final answer will be incorrect.

To avoid this problem, the distance and speed should be in the same units.

**5. Using the wrong value for pi**

The value of pi is approximately 3.1415926535. However, some developers mistakenly use the value 3.14 for pi.

This can lead to rounding errors, which can cause the final answer to be incorrect.

To avoid this problem, the correct value for pi should be used.

**6. Not taking into account the possibility of ties**

When multiple taxis are traveling to the same point, it is possible that they will arrive at the same time.

If this happens, the final answer should be the smallest possible time.

**7. Not handling errors correctly**

If there is an error in the input data, the program should handle the error gracefully.

For example, if the number of taxis is negative, the program should print an error message and exit.

**8. Not using comments**

Comments are used to explain the code to other developers. They can also be used to document the purpose of the code and to provide instructions on how to use it.

It is important to use comments in your code so that other developers can understand what it does.

**9. Not using proper indentation**

Proper indentation makes your code easier to read and understand. It also helps to prevent errors.

Make sure to use proper indentation in your code.

**10. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code to make sure that it works correctly. This can be done by writing unit tests or by running the code on a variety of input data.

By testing your code, you can catch errors early and prevent them from causing problems in production.

CODEFORCES 817_E. Choosing The Commander

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the bitwise XOR operator.** The bitwise XOR operator is often implemented incorrectly, resulting in incorrect results. For example, the following code would incorrectly compute the bitwise XOR of two numbers:

```
int bitwiseXOR(int a, int b) {
  return a ^ b;
}
```

The correct implementation of the bitwise XOR operator is as follows:

```
int bitwiseXOR(int a, int b) {
  return a ^ b;
}
```

2. **Incorrect use of the modulus operator.** The modulus operator (%) is often used incorrectly, resulting in incorrect results. For example, the following code would incorrectly compute the remainder of dividing a number by 2:

```
int remainder(int a, int b) {
  return a % b;
}
```

The correct implementation of the modulus operator is as follows:

```
int remainder(int a, int b) {
  return a % b;
}
```

3. **Incorrect use of the conditional operator.** The conditional operator (? :) is often used incorrectly, resulting in incorrect results. For example, the following code would incorrectly check if a number is even:

```
int isEven(int a) {
  return a % 2 == 0 ? true : false;
}
```

The correct implementation of the conditional operator is as follows:

```
int isEven(int a) {
  return a % 2 == 0;
}
```

4. **Incorrect use of the short-circuit evaluation operator.** The short-circuit evaluation operator (&& ||) is often used incorrectly, resulting in incorrect results. For example, the following code would incorrectly check if two numbers are equal:

```
bool areEqual(int a, int b) {
  return a == b && a != 0;
}
```

The correct implementation of the short-circuit evaluation operator is as follows:

```
bool areEqual(int a, int b) {
  return a == b;
}

Title:
CODEFORCES 842_E. Nikita and game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The tree traversal algorithm should visit each node exactly once, and the order in which the nodes are visited should not matter.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the distance between two nodes in the tree.** The distance between two nodes in a tree is the number of edges in the shortest path between the two nodes. This can be calculated using a breadth-first search or a depth-first search.
3. **Incorrect handling of special cases.** The problem statement specifies that the maximum cost of changing one class to another is x. If x is equal to 0, then there is no distance between any two nodes in the tree. If x is greater than the number of nodes in the tree, then there is no path between any two nodes in the tree.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The problem statement specifies that the output should be a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of classes that have a distance of x from some other class. The output should be formatted correctly, with each integer on a new line.
5. **Runtime errors.** The problem statement specifies that the input and output should be within a certain size limit. If the input or output is too large, the program may run out of memory or time.

CODEFORCES 933_E. A Preponderant Reunion

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correct. For example, the input may contain a negative integer, or a string instead of an integer.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correct. For example, the output may contain a non-integer, or a string instead of an integer.

Title:
CODEFORCES 960_B. Minimize the error

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong formula for calculating the error.** The error is defined as <image>. This means that we need to take the square of the difference between each element of A and B. For example, if A = [1, 2] and B = [3, 4], then the error is <image> = (1 - 3)^2 + (2 - 4)^2 = 10.

**2. Not considering the constraints on the number of operations that can be performed on each array.** The problem states that we can perform exactly k1 operations on array A and exactly k2 operations on array B. This means that we cannot perform more than k1 operations on A or more than k2 operations on B. For example, if k1 = 2 and k2 = 3, then we cannot perform 4 operations on array A or 5 operations on array B.

**3. Not choosing the best possible values for the elements of A and B.** The goal is to minimize the error, so we should choose values for the elements of A and B that will result in the smallest possible error. For example, if k1 = 2 and k2 = 3, then we should choose values for the elements of A and B such that the sum of the absolute values of the differences between the elements of A and B is minimized.

**4. Not using the fact that the error is symmetric.** The error is symmetric, meaning that it doesn't matter which array we perform the operations on first. This means that we can always choose to perform the operations on the array with the smaller sum of absolute values of the elements. For example, if A = [1, 2] and B = [3, 4], then the sum of the absolute values of the elements of A is 3 and the sum of the absolute values of the elements of B is 5. Since 3 < 5, we should always choose to perform the operations on array A first.

Title:
CODEFORCES 987_E. Petr and Permutations

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format for this problem is not very strict. It allows for a lot of different ways to write the input data. This can lead to errors if the developer does not correctly parse the input data.

For example, the input data could be written in a different order, or it could contain spaces or other characters that are not allowed. If the developer does not correctly parse the input data, their program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.

### 2. Incorrect output format

The output format for this problem is also not very strict. It allows for a lot of different ways to write the output data. This can lead to errors if the developer does not correctly format the output data.

For example, the output data could be written in a different order, or it could contain spaces or other characters that are not allowed. If the developer does not correctly format the output data, their program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.

### 3. Incorrect algorithm

The algorithm used to solve this problem is also not very straightforward. It requires the developer to be able to track the number of swaps that have been performed, and to be able to determine which method was used to generate the permutation.

If the developer does not correctly implement the algorithm, their program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.

### 4. Runtime errors

This problem can also be solved using a brute-force algorithm. This algorithm will iterate through all possible permutations of the numbers from 1 to n, and it will check if each permutation is a valid solution to the problem.

This algorithm can be very inefficient, and it can lead to runtime errors if the number of permutations is large.

### 5. Memory errors

This problem can also be solved using a dynamic programming algorithm. This algorithm will build up a table of solutions to the problem, and it will use this table to find the solution for the given input data.

This algorithm can be very memory-intensive, and it can lead to memory errors if the number of permutations is large.

### 6. Incorrect data

The data used to generate the test cases for this problem is not guaranteed to be correct. This means that the developer must be careful to check the data for errors before using it to solve the problem.

For example, the data could contain duplicate values, or it could contain values that are not between 1 and n. If the developer does not correctly check the data, their program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.
Test inputs:
### 1. Incorrect input format

```
1
1
```

This input is incorrect because it does not have a second line of input.

### 2. Incorrect output format

```
Petr
```

This output is incorrect because it does not have a newline character at the end.

### 3. Incorrect algorithm

```
n = int(input())

permutation = list(range(1, n + 1))

for i in range(3 * n):
    i1 = random.randint(0, n - 1)
    i2 = random.randint(0, n - 1)

    permutation[i1], permutation[i2] = permutation[i2], permutation[i1]

if permutation == list(range(1, n + 1)):
    print('Petr')
else:
    print('Um_nik')
```

This algorithm is incorrect because it does not correctly track the number of swaps that have been performed.

### 4. Runtime errors

```
n = int(input())

permutation = list(range(1, n + 1))

for i in range(n):
    i1 = random.randint(0, n - 1)
    i2 = random.randint(0, n - 1)

    permutation[i1], permutation[i2] = permutation[i2], permutation[i1]

if permutation == list(range(1, n + 1)):
    print('Petr')
else:
    print('Um_nik')
```

This algorithm is incorrect because it will run for a long time if n is large.

### 5. Memory errors

```
n = int(input())

permutation = list(range(1, n + 1))

for i in range(n):
    i1 = random.randint(0, n - 1)
    i2 = random.randint(0, n - 1)

    permutation[i1], permutation[i2] = permutation[i2], permutation[i1]

if permutation == list(range(1, n + 1)):
    print('Petr')
else:
    print('Um_nik')
```

This algorithm is incorrect because it will use a lot of memory if n is large.

### 6. Incorrect data

```

This data is incorrect because it contains a duplicate value (1).

HACKEREARTH caesar-cipher

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Caesar cipher algorithm.** The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher that can be implemented in a few lines of code. However, it is important to get the implementation correct, or the encrypted message will not be secure.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When shifting the letters of the message by a certain number of positions, it is important to make sure that the letters wrap around at the end of the alphabet. For example, if the message is "abc" and the key is 3, the encrypted message should be "def". However, if the implementation is incorrect and the letters are not wrapped around, the encrypted message will be "efg".
3. **Input validation errors.** The input to the Caesar cipher algorithm should be validated to ensure that it is valid. For example, the key should be a positive integer, and the message should be a string of characters. If the input is not valid, the algorithm should throw an error.
4. **Output formatting errors.** The output of the Caesar cipher algorithm should be formatted correctly. For example, the encrypted message should be a string of characters, and it should be separated from the key by a newline character.
5. **Security vulnerabilities.** The Caesar cipher is a very simple cipher, and it is not very secure. If the key is small, it is possible to brute-force the cipher and decrypt the message. Additionally, the Caesar cipher is not resistant to frequency analysis, which can be used to decrypt the message.

HACKEREARTH killing-white-walkers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect calculation of the position of the survivor.** The survivor is not always in the position of the first White Walker. For example, if there are 5 White Walkers, the survivor will be in the position of the 4th White Walker.
2. **Using an incorrect data type to store the number of White Walkers.** The number of White Walkers can be very large, so it is important to use a data type that can store large numbers.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem.** The problem can be solved using a simple algorithm, such as the following:

```
def find_survivor(n):
  # Initialize the position of the survivor to 1.
  survivor = 1

  # Iterate over the number of White Walkers.
  for i in range(2, n + 1):
    # If the current White Walker is the survivor, then skip it.
    if i == survivor:
      continue

    # Otherwise, kill the current White Walker and update the position of the survivor.
    survivor = (survivor + i) % n

  # Return the position of the survivor.
  return survivor
```

4. **Not handling edge cases correctly.** The problem may have edge cases, such as when the number of White Walkers is 1 or 2. It is important to handle these edge cases correctly.

1. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating through the list of numbers, it is important to make sure that you are checking the correct index. For example, if you are trying to check if the next number is smaller than the current number, you need to make sure that you are checking the number at index `i + 1`.
2. **Incorrect assumptions.** When solving a problem, it is important to make sure that you are not making any incorrect assumptions. For example, you might assume that the list of numbers is always sorted, or that the numbers are always positive.
3. **Mathematical errors.** When solving a problem that involves math, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct formulas and equations. For example, you might accidentally use the wrong formula to calculate the area of a circle.
4. **Logical errors.** When solving a problem, it is important to make sure that your logic is sound. For example, you might have a solution that works for some cases but not for others.
5. **Code errors.** When writing code to solve a problem, it is important to make sure that your code is correct. For example, you might have a typo in your code that causes it to malfunction.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer might accidentally iterate through the list of numbers twice, which would cause them to miss the first or last number.
* The developer might assume that the list of numbers is always sorted, which would cause them to incorrectly determine whether or not it is possible to modify the sequence into all zeros.
* The developer might accidentally use the wrong formula to calculate the sum of the numbers in the list, which would cause them to incorrectly determine whether or not it is possible to modify the sequence into all zeros.
* The developer might have a solution that works for some cases but not for others, due to a logical error in their code.
* The developer might have a typo in their code, which would cause it to malfunction.

Title:
HACKEREARTH upup

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly identifying the start of a word.** The problem statement specifies that each word is separated by one or more spaces. However, a developer might incorrectly identify the start of a word if there is a space before or after a punctuation mark. For example, the string "word1, word2" would be incorrectly split into two words: "word1," and "word2".
2. **Incorrectly capitalizing the first letter of a word.** The problem statement specifies that the first letter of each word should be capitalized. However, a developer might incorrectly capitalize the first letter of a word that does not start with a lowercase letter. For example, the string "123abc" would be incorrectly capitalized as "123ABC".
3. **Incorrectly handling words that contain multiple capital letters.** The problem statement does not specify how to handle words that contain multiple capital letters. A developer might incorrectly capitalize all of the letters in the word, or only the first letter. For example, the string "The quick brown fox" could be incorrectly capitalized as "The Quick Brown Fox" or "The quick brown fox".
4. **Incorrectly handling words that contain non-Latin letters.** The problem statement specifies that words consist of Latin letters as well as other symbols. However, a developer might incorrectly assume that all words contain only Latin letters. For example, the string "你好" would be incorrectly capitalized as "你好".
5. **Incorrectly handling strings that contain multiple spaces.** The problem statement specifies that each word is separated by one or more spaces. However, a developer might incorrectly count spaces that are not part of a word. For example, the string "word 1 word 2" would be incorrectly split into three words: "word", "1", and "word 2".

Title:
ATCODER p02722 AtCoder Beginner Contest 161 - Division or Subtraction

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type**

The input N is a positive integer, so it should be stored in a data type that can represent positive integers up to 10^12. For example, if you use an integer data type, you may get an overflow error when N is large.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the number of choices of K in which N becomes 1 in the end. A naive algorithm would be to try all possible values of K from 2 to N, and check if N becomes 1 after each operation. However, this algorithm has a time complexity of O(N), which is too slow for large values of N.

**3. Not handling special cases correctly**

The problem states that N is an integer, but it does not specify the range of values that N can take. For example, N could be negative or zero. If you do not handle these special cases correctly, your code may not work correctly.

**4. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

The problem states that N will become less than K in the end. However, it does not specify what happens if N is already less than K. If you do not handle this case correctly, your code may not work correctly.

**5. Using incorrect mathematical formulas**

The problem asks us to find the number of choices of K in which N becomes 1 in the end. To do this, we need to know the number of times that N is divided by K and the number of times that N is subtracted by K. If you use incorrect mathematical formulas, your answer may be incorrect.

**6. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved in O(log N) time using the following algorithm:

1. Initialize a counter C to 0.
2. While N is not equal to 1:
    * If N is divisible by 2, divide N by 2 and increment C by 1.
    * Otherwise, subtract 1 from N.
3. Print C.

Title:
ATCODER p02989 AtCoder Beginner Contest 132 - Divide the Problems

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of integers. If the developer uses an incorrect data type to store the input data, it may cause problems when the program tries to process the data. For example, if the developer uses a string to store the input data, it will not be able to correctly compare the values of the integers in the list.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the developer may try to solve the problem using a brute-force algorithm, which will be very inefficient. A more efficient algorithm would be to use a sorting algorithm to sort the list of integers and then use a binary search to find the value of K that makes the number of problems for ARCs and the number of problems for ABCs the same.

**3. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

The developer may not handle the boundary conditions correctly. For example, the developer may not check if the input data is valid or if the value of K is within the correct range. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

**4. Not handling errors correctly**

The developer may not handle errors correctly. For example, the developer may not catch exceptions that are thrown by the program. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

**5. Not testing the code**

The developer may not test the code thoroughly. This could lead to the program containing bugs that are not caught until it is deployed to production. To avoid this, the developer should test the code with a variety of input data and ensure that the program produces the correct results.

Title:
ATCODER p03130 Yahoo Programming Contest 2019 - Path

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly initializing the graph.** The graph should be initialized with all possible edges, not just the ones given in the input. For example, if the input is `1 2`, `2 3`, and `3 4`, the graph should be initialized with edges `1 2`, `2 3`, `3 4`, `1 3`, `2 4`, and `3 1`.
2. **Not considering all possible paths.** When traversing the graph, you need to consider all possible paths, not just the ones that are given in the input. For example, if the input is `1 2`, `2 3`, and `3 4`, you need to consider the path `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4`, as well as the path `1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4`.
3. **Misusing the `visited` array.** The `visited` array should be used to track which towns you have already visited. If you incorrectly use the `visited` array, you may end up visiting a town more than once, or you may not visit all of the towns.
4. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are many different algorithms that you can use to solve this problem. The most efficient algorithm is a depth-first search.
5. **Not handling edge cases correctly.** Make sure to handle edge cases correctly, such as the case where the graph is not connected.

Title:
ATCODER p03273 AtCoder Beginner Contest 107 - Grid Compression

Pain points:
The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are as follows:

1. **Incorrectly identifying the rows and columns that consist of only white squares.** This can lead to the developer performing the compression operation on a row or column that does not actually consist of only white squares, which will result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrectly updating the grid after each compression operation.** This can lead to the developer losing track of which rows and columns have been compressed, which will also result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Not handling the case where the grid is empty after all of the compression operations have been performed.** This can lead to the developer printing an empty grid, which is not the correct output.

In order to avoid these problems, the developer should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that they understand the constraints and the expected output. They should also carefully write their code and test it thoroughly to ensure that it is correct.

Here are some specific tips that may help the developer avoid these problems:

* Use a data structure to store the rows and columns of the grid. This will make it easier to identify the rows and columns that consist of only white squares.
* Use a separate data structure to store the compressed grid. This will make it easier to update the grid after each compression operation.
* Write unit tests to test your code. This will help you to catch errors in your code before they cause problems.

Title:
ATCODER p03430 AtCoder Grand Contest 021 - Reversed LCS

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem states that the input string `S` has length at most 300. However, if you try to use a `vector<char>` to store the characters in `S`, you will get a segmentation fault when `S` has length 301 or more. To avoid this, you should use a `string` instead of a `vector<char>`.
2. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** The problem asks you to find the longest common subsequence of two strings, `S` and `S'`. The naive approach to this problem is to use a brute-force algorithm that enumerates all possible subsequences of `S` and `S'` and then finds the longest one. However, this algorithm has a time complexity of O(N^2), where `N` is the length of `S`. For large values of `N`, this algorithm will be too slow. A more efficient approach is to use the dynamic programming algorithm known as the longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm. The LCS algorithm has a time complexity of O(N*M), where `M` is the length of `S'`.
3. **Incorrect handling of errors.** The problem states that the input string `S` consists of lowercase English letters. However, if you try to parse `S` as a string and then use the `isalpha()` function to check if each character is a lowercase English letter, you will get a runtime error if `S` contains any non-alphabetic characters. To avoid this, you should use the `std::regex_match()` function to check if `S` matches the regular expression `[a-z]+`.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The problem asks you to print the highest possible value achievable. However, if you simply print the value of the longest common subsequence of `S` and `S'`, you will not get the correct answer. The reason for this is that the longest common subsequence of `S` and `S'` may not be a contiguous substring of `S`. To get the correct answer, you need to find the longest contiguous substring of `S` that is also a subsequence of `S'`.
5. **Incorrect use of resources.** The problem states that the input string `S` has length at most 300. However, if you try to allocate a buffer of size 301 to store the characters in `S`, you will get a memory leak. To avoid this, you should allocate a buffer of size `S.length() + 1`.

Title:
ATCODER p03746 AtCoder Grand Contest 013 - Hamiltonish Path

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data structure**

The input graph is represented as a list of edges. This can be a problem if the graph is large, as the list can take up a lot of memory. A better solution would be to use an adjacency list, which stores each vertex's neighbors in a list. This would use much less memory, and would also be faster to iterate over.

**2. Not handling duplicate edges correctly**

The input graph may contain duplicate edges. This can be a problem if we try to use a simple algorithm to find a Hamiltonian path, such as the depth-first search algorithm. A better solution would be to use a more sophisticated algorithm, such as the A* algorithm, which can handle duplicate edges correctly.

**3. Not handling disconnected graphs correctly**

The input graph may be disconnected, meaning that it is not possible to reach every vertex from every other vertex. This can be a problem if we try to use a simple algorithm to find a Hamiltonian path, such as the breadth-first search algorithm. A better solution would be to use a more sophisticated algorithm, such as the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which can handle disconnected graphs correctly.

**4. Not handling graphs with multiple Hamiltonian paths correctly**

The input graph may have multiple Hamiltonian paths. This can be a problem if we only want to find one of the Hamiltonian paths. A better solution would be to use an algorithm that can find all of the Hamiltonian paths in the graph.

**5. Not handling graphs with self-loops correctly**

The input graph may contain self-loops. This can be a problem if we try to use a simple algorithm to find a Hamiltonian path, such as the depth-first search algorithm. A better solution would be to use a more sophisticated algorithm, such as the A* algorithm, which can handle self-loops correctly.

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input is given in the form of integers, but the problem statement mentions that the prices can be up to 10^12. This means that we need to use a data type that can store numbers that large. If we use an integer data type, we will get an overflow error.

**2. Not handling negative prices correctly**

The problem statement does not mention anything about negative prices, but it is possible that the input contains negative prices. If we do not handle negative prices correctly, we may get an incorrect answer.

**3. Not handling duplicate prices correctly**

The problem statement does not mention anything about duplicate prices, but it is possible that the input contains duplicate prices. If we do not handle duplicate prices correctly, we may get an incorrect answer.

**4. Not handling the case where the total price is 0 correctly**

The problem statement does not mention anything about the case where the total price is 0, but it is possible that the input contains a total price of 0. If we do not handle this case correctly, we may get an incorrect answer.

**5. Not handling the case where the input is empty correctly**

Title:
AIZU p00012 A Point in a Triangle

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect comparison of floating-point numbers**. Floating-point numbers are not precise, so it is possible for two numbers that are not equal to be compared as equal. This can lead to incorrect results in your program. To avoid this problem, you should use the `<=` and `>=` operators instead of the `==` operator when comparing floating-point numbers.
2. **Incorrect calculation of distances**. When calculating the distance between two points, it is important to use the correct formula. The formula for the distance between two points in Cartesian coordinates is:

```
d = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)
```

3. **Incorrect handling of degenerate triangles**. A degenerate triangle is a triangle with zero area. Degenerate triangles can occur when the three points are collinear or when two of the points are the same. Your program should handle degenerate triangles correctly.
4. **Incorrect handling of input errors**. Your program should handle input errors gracefully. For example, if the input contains invalid data, your program should print an error message and exit.
5. **Incorrect output formatting**. Your program should output the results in the correct format. For example, the output should be in all caps and should not contain any spaces.

Title:
AIZU p00931 Cornering at Poles

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not specified in the problem statement. A developer may incorrectly assume that the input format is a list of lists, where each inner list contains the x and y coordinates of a pole. This would result in an incorrect solution.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the distance between two points**

The distance between two points can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. However, a developer may incorrectly use the Euclidean distance, which does not take into account the curvature of the Earth. This would result in an incorrect solution.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the total distance traveled**

The total distance traveled can be calculated by summing the distances between each pair of consecutive poles. However, a developer may incorrectly add the distances in the wrong order, or may forget to add the distance from the starting point to the first pole and the distance from the last pole to the end point. This would result in an incorrect solution.

**4. Floating-point errors**

The calculations involved in this problem are likely to involve floating-point numbers. Floating-point numbers are subject to rounding errors, which can accumulate and lead to an incorrect solution. A developer should take care to minimize the effects of floating-point errors by using the correct rounding mode and by avoiding unnecessary calculations.

**5. Off-by-one errors**

A developer may incorrectly index into the list of poles, resulting in an off-by-one error. This would result in an incorrect solution.

**6. Incorrect handling of boundary conditions**

The problem statement does not specify what to do if the starting point or the end point is a pole. A developer should handle these cases correctly to avoid an incorrect solution.

Title:
AIZU p01064 Array Update 2

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Off-by-one errors**. When updating the array, it is important to make sure that you are updating the correct indices. A common mistake is to update the index one past the end of the array, which will cause the values to be overwritten.
* **Indexing errors**. When iterating through the array, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct indices. A common mistake is to use the wrong index, which will cause you to skip over or repeat values.
* **Arithmetic errors**. When calculating the new values of the array, it is important to make sure that you are doing the math correctly. A common mistake is to make a mistake in the order of operations, which will cause the wrong values to be calculated.
* **Boundary errors**. When updating the array, it is important to make sure that you are not going out of bounds. A common mistake is to try to update an index that is outside of the range of the array, which will cause an error.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

* **Use a debugger**. A debugger can help you track down errors by letting you step through your code line by line. This can be a helpful way to find off-by-one errors and indexing errors.
* **Write unit tests**. Unit tests can help you catch errors in your code before they cause problems. Unit tests should be written for each function in your code, and they should test all of the different possible inputs and outputs.
* **Use the right data types**. Make sure that you are using the right data types for your variables. For example, if you are storing integers, you should use the `int` type. Using the wrong data type can cause arithmetic errors.
* **Be careful with floating-point numbers**. Floating-point numbers can be imprecise, so it is important to be careful when using them. For example, you should avoid comparing floating-point numbers for equality.
* **Check for boundary errors**. Make sure that you are not going out of bounds when updating the array. You can do this by checking the index before you use it.

Title:
AIZU p01672 Point Distance

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a grid map of size N x N, where N is a positive integer. Each cell of the grid map can contain a number of molecules, which is a non-negative integer. If we use an integer data type to store the number of molecules in each cell, then we may encounter an overflow error when the number of molecules in a cell is large. To avoid this problem, we should use a floating-point data type to store the number of molecules in each cell.

**2. Using the wrong formula to calculate the distance between two points**

The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by the formula

```
d = sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)
```

If we use the wrong formula to calculate the distance between two points, then the output of the program will be incorrect.

**3. Not handling the case where there are no molecules in a cell**

The input data may contain a cell that does not contain any molecules. In this case, the distance between any two points in the cell is zero. We should handle this case by setting the distance to zero.

**4. Not handling the case where two points are the same**

The distance between two points is zero if and only if the two points are the same. We should handle this case by setting the distance to zero.

**5. Not sorting the distances in ascending order**

The output of the program should be a histogram of all pair distances, sorted in ascending order. We should sort the distances before printing them out.

Title:
AIZU p01814 Nearly Cyclic String

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of substring function.** The substring function in Python takes the start and end index of the substring as arguments. In this problem, the start index is inclusive and the end index is exclusive. So, if you want to get the substring from index 1 to index 5, you should use `S[1:6]`.
2. **Incorrect use of modulo operator.** The modulo operator in Python returns the remainder of a division. So, if you want to find the remainder of 10 divided by 3, you should use `10 % 3`.
3. **Incorrect use of list comprehension.** A list comprehension is a concise way to create a list. In this problem, you can use a list comprehension to create a list of all the substrings of the given string. For example, the following code will create a list of all the substrings of the string `"abc"`:

```
['a', 'b', 'c', 'ab', 'bc', 'ac']
```

4. **Incorrect use of for loop.** The for loop in Python iterates over a sequence. In this problem, you can use a for loop to iterate over all the queries. For each query, you can use a second for loop to iterate over all the substrings of the given string.
5. **Incorrect use of if statement.** The if statement in Python checks if a condition is true. In this problem, you can use an if statement to check if the given substring is a periodic string.

Here are some tips for solving this problem:

1. Use the substring function to get the substring of the given string.
2. Use the modulo operator to find the remainder of the length of the substring divided by the period.
3. Use a list comprehension to create a list of all the substrings of the given string.
4. Use a for loop to iterate over all the queries.
5. Use an if statement to check if the given substring is a periodic string.
Test inputs:
```
S = input()
Q = int(input())
for _ in range(Q):
    l, r, t = map(int, input().split())
    s = S[l-1:r]
    print("Yes" if (r-l+1)%t==0 else "No")
```
Title:
AIZU p01949 Route Calculator

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of variables**

When writing code, it is important to use variables correctly. For example, in the following code, the variable `i` is used to iterate over the rows of the grid, but it is also used to store the value of the current cell. This can lead to errors, such as the value of `i` being incremented when it should not be.

```
for i in range(H):
  for j in range(W):
    # Do something with the value of `a[i][j]`
    i += 1
```

**2. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that occurs when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. For example, in the following code, the loop iterates over the rows of the grid, but it does not include the last row. This can lead to errors, such as the value of `a[H][W]` not being processed.

```
for i in range(H):
  for j in range(W):
    # Do something with the value of `a[i][j]`
```

**3. Incorrect data types**

It is important to use the correct data types for variables. For example, in the following code, the variable `a` is declared as a list of lists, but it is actually being used to store a 2D array. This can lead to errors, such as the value of `a[0][0]` being overwritten when it should not be.

```
a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

# This will overwrite the value of `a[0][0]`
a[0][0] = 5
```

**4. Logic errors**

Logic errors are errors that occur when the logic of the code is incorrect. For example, in the following code, the loop will never terminate because the condition `i < H` is always true.

```
while i < H:
  # Do something
  i += 1
```

**5. Missing or incorrect error handling**

It is important to handle errors correctly. For example, if the user enters invalid input, the program should handle the error gracefully and not crash.

**6. Security vulnerabilities**

It is important to write secure code. For example, the following code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack because it does not check the size of the input before copying it into a buffer.

```
user_input = input()
buffer = b''
for i in range(len(user_input)):
  buffer += user_input[i]
```
Test inputs:

  cell = a[i // W][i % W]

  # Calculate the value of the current cell
  value = int(cell) if cell.isdigit() else cell

  # Update the maximum value
  max_value = max(max_value, value)

# Print the maximum value

```

**5. Missing or incorrect error handling**

```

Title:
AIZU p02098 The Mean of Angles

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input type**. The input should be two integers representing the angles θ1 and θ2. If the input is not in the correct format, the program will not be able to correctly calculate the angle between the two angles.
2. **Incorrect output type**. The output should be a single floating-point number representing the angle between the two angles in degrees. The output should be rounded to the nearest thousandth of a degree. If the output is not in the correct format, the program will not be accepted.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the angle**. The angle between two angles can be calculated using the following formula:

```
angle = (θ1 + θ2) / 2
```

However, it is important to note that the angle must be in the range [0, 360). If the angle is outside of this range, it must be adjusted accordingly.
4. **Floating-point errors**. When calculating the angle between two angles, it is important to be aware of floating-point errors. Floating-point errors can occur when the numbers are very small or very large. To avoid these errors, it is important to use the correct rounding method.
5. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors can occur when the index of an array or list is incorrect. This can cause the program to incorrectly calculate the angle between the two angles.
6. **Boundary errors**. Boundary errors can occur when the input values are at the edge of the valid range. For example, if the input values are 0 and 360, the program will incorrectly calculate the angle between the two angles as 180 degrees.
7. **Logic errors**. Logic errors can occur when the program is not correctly implemented. This can cause the program to incorrectly calculate the angle between the two angles or to crash.

By following these tips, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving the problem of finding the angle between two angles.

Title:
AIZU p02236 Optimal Binary Search Tree

Pain points:
1. The input format is not very clear. For example, it is not clear whether the probabilities should be given in a single line or multiple lines.
2. The problem statement does not specify how to handle ties when inserting keys into the binary search tree.
3. The problem statement does not specify how to handle the case where the sum of the probabilities is not 1.
4. The solution is not very efficient. It takes O(n^2) time to construct the optimal binary search tree.
5. The solution does not handle the case where some of the probabilities are negative.
6. The solution does not handle the case where some of the keys are repeated.
Test inputs:

Title:
AIZU p02382 Distance II

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong formula**

The Minkowski distance is defined as follows:

```
D_{xy} = (\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - y_i|^p)^{\frac{1}{p}}
```

However, a common mistake is to use the following formula instead:

```
D_{xy} = \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - y_i|^p
```

This will result in an incorrect answer.

**2. Using the wrong value for `p`**

The value of `p` must be a positive integer. If `p` is not a positive integer, the Minkowski distance will not be defined.

**3. Not using the correct order of operations**

When computing the Minkowski distance, it is important to use the correct order of operations. The following steps should be followed:

1. Square each of the differences between the corresponding elements of `x` and `y`.
2. Add the squared differences together.
3. Raise the sum to the power of `1 / p`.

If the steps are not performed in the correct order, the resulting distance will be incorrect.

**4. Using floating-point arithmetic**

The Minkowski distance is a real number, so it must be computed using floating-point arithmetic. If integer arithmetic is used, the resulting distance will be incorrect.

**5. Not using enough precision**

When computing the Minkowski distance, it is important to use enough precision to avoid rounding errors. If not enough precision is used, the resulting distance will be incorrect.

**6. Using an incorrect algorithm**

There are many different algorithms that can be used to compute the Minkowski distance. Not all algorithms are equally efficient or accurate. It is important to choose an algorithm that is appropriate for the problem at hand.

**7. Not handling errors correctly**

There are a number of ways that errors can occur when computing the Minkowski distance. It is important to handle these errors correctly in order to ensure that the resulting distance is correct.

**8. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code that is used to compute the Minkowski distance to ensure that it is correct. This can be done by testing the code with a variety of input values and checking that the results are correct.
