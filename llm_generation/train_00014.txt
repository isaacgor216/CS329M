Title:
CODECHEF admag

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the magic trick.** The developer may incorrectly implement the magic trick, resulting in the trick not working correctly. For example, the developer may not correctly account for the fact that the same integer may appear in more than one card.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the lexicographical sorting algorithm.** The developer may incorrectly implement the lexicographical sorting algorithm, resulting in the cards not being sorted correctly. This could cause the magic trick to not work correctly, as the developer may not be able to find the card that contains the integer that the user thought of.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the minimum number of cards required calculation.** The developer may incorrectly implement the calculation of the minimum number of cards required, resulting in the developer providing an incorrect answer. For example, the developer may not correctly account for the fact that the same integer may appear in more than one card.
4. **Incorrect input validation.** The developer may not correctly validate the input, resulting in the developer providing an incorrect answer. For example, the developer may not correctly check that the input is a valid integer.
5. **Incorrect output formatting.** The developer may not correctly format the output, resulting in the output being difficult to read or understand. For example, the developer may not correctly align the output or use the correct number of digits.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully review the problem statement and make sure that they understand the problem correctly. The developer should also carefully implement the magic trick, the lexicographical sorting algorithm, and the minimum number of cards required calculation. Finally, the developer should carefully validate the input and format the output correctly.

Title:
CODECHEF dragnxor

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement is not clear about what a "shuffle-A" is. It is not immediately obvious that a shuffle-A is any 5-bit integer having exactly two 1s in it. This could lead to a bug where the developer incorrectly assumes that a shuffle-A is any 5-bit integer, regardless of the number of 1s in it.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the bit-wise xor operator.** The bit-wise xor operator takes two bit strings of equal length and performs the logical XOR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result in each position is 1 if only the first bit is 1 OR only the second bit is 1, but will be 0 if both are 1 or both are 0. For example, 5 (0101) xor 3(0011) = 6(0110). In most languages it is represented using ^ symbol. 5 ^ 3 = 6. However, some developers may incorrectly implement the bit-wise xor operator by performing the bitwise OR operation on the two bit strings. This would result in a incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect handling of leading 0 bits.** The problem statement states that if the integer actually needs less than N bits to represent in binary, append sufficient number of leading 0 bits. For example, as shown in the problem statement for N = 5, A = 6 = (00110)2. However, some developers may forget to append the leading 0 bits, which would result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect use of the max function.** The problem statement asks for the maximum possible value of (shuffle-A xor shuffle-B). However, some developers may incorrectly use the max function to find the minimum possible value of (shuffle-A xor shuffle-B). This would result in an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect use of the pow function.** The problem statement states that the input integers A and B are less than 2^N. However, some developers may incorrectly use the pow function to calculate 2^N, which would result in an incorrect answer.
6. **Incorrect use of the bitwise AND operator.** The problem statement states that the input integers A and B are less than 2^N. However, some developers may incorrectly use the bitwise AND operator to check if an integer is less than 2^N, which would result in an incorrect answer.

Title:
CODECHEF jntuv1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the input should be a single integer, but the problem statement does not specify what to do if the input is not in the correct format. A developer could incorrectly assume that the input is always in the correct format and then encounter a runtime error when the input is invalid.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the nth number**. The problem statement specifies that the nth number in the series is given by the following formula:

```
nth_number = 3 if n is odd
nth_number = 4 if n is even
```

A developer could incorrectly calculate the nth number by using a different formula, or by making a mistake in the implementation of the formula.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The problem statement specifies that the output should be the nth number in the series. A developer could incorrectly output the wrong number, or could output the number in the wrong format.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully read and understand the problem statement and input format. They should also carefully implement the solution to ensure that it is correct. In addition, they should test their solution with a variety of inputs to ensure that it works correctly in all cases.

Title:
CODECHEF nukes

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem statement is not very clear, so it is important to read it carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked. For example, it is not immediately obvious that the particles are being bombarded one at a time.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution to this problem is not trivial, so it is important to make sure that you implement it correctly. For example, you need to be careful to handle the case where a particle is lost when it is going out from the last chamber.
3. **Incorrect test cases.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly. For example, you should test your solution with different values of A, N, and K.
4. **Incorrect submission.** Make sure that you submit your solution in the correct format. For example, you need to make sure that your output is a single line of K numbers, separated by spaces.
5. **Incorrect runtime.** The runtime of your solution is important, so you should try to optimize it as much as possible. For example, you can use a data structure like a heap to efficiently find the chamber with the most particles.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain a space between two integers, or it may contain a negative number. The developer should check the input format and handle incorrect input appropriately.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correct. For example, the output may contain a space between two numbers, or it may contain a negative number. The developer should check the output format and handle incorrect output appropriately.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the average value. For example, the developer may forget to divide the sum of the numbers by the number of numbers. The developer should carefully check the calculation and make sure that it is correct.
4. **Incorrect error handling**. The developer may incorrectly handle errors. For example, the developer may not handle errors that occur when reading the input or when calculating the average value. The developer should carefully handle all possible errors.
5. **Inefficient code**. The developer may write inefficient code. For example, the developer may use a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem. The developer should write efficient code that uses the best possible algorithms.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1028_B. Unnatural Conditions

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the two integers n and m should be separated by a single space. However, if the input contains two integers separated by multiple spaces, or if the input contains any characters other than digits, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of s(a) and s(b).** The sum of digits in a positive integer can be calculated by summing the digits of the integer one by one. However, if the integer contains leading zeros, these zeros must be ignored when calculating the sum of digits. For example, the sum of digits in the integer 00123 is 6, not 123.
3. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the two integers a and b should be printed on separate lines, and that both numbers must not contain leading zeros. However, if the output contains leading zeros, or if the output contains any characters other than digits, the program may receive a negative score.
4. **Incorrect solution.** The program may find a solution that does not satisfy the constraints of the problem. For example, the program may find a solution where s(a) < n or s(b) < n.
5. **Infinite loop.** The program may enter an infinite loop if it does not properly handle certain input conditions. For example, the program may enter an infinite loop if it is given an input where n = m.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and to understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the program thoroughly with a variety of different input values.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1046_H. Palindrome Pairs

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is a string array. But the developer may mistakenly assume that it is an integer array. This will cause the program to crash.

**2. Incorrect logic**

The developer may incorrectly assume that two strings are palindrome pairs if they are equal. For example, the strings "abc" and "cba" are not palindrome pairs, even though they are equal.

**3. Off-by-one error**

The developer may incorrectly count the number of palindrome pairs. For example, the developer may count the pair of strings "abc" and "cba" twice, when it should only be counted once.

**4. Memory leak**

The developer may not free the memory that is allocated for the string array. This will cause the program to run out of memory and crash.

**5. Race condition**

The developer may not synchronize access to the string array. This may cause the program to produce incorrect results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1092_C. Prefixes and Suffixes

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

When working with strings, it is important to use the correct data type. In Python, strings are represented by the `str` type. If you try to use an integer or a float to store a string, you will get an error.

**2. Forgetting to close files**

When you open a file in Python, you need to make sure to close it when you are finished with it. If you forget to close a file, it will remain open and take up resources on your computer.

**3. Using incorrect looping conditions**

When you are looping through a list of strings, it is important to make sure that you use the correct looping condition. If you use the wrong looping condition, you may end up skipping some strings or looping over the same string multiple times.

**4. Not handling errors correctly**

When you are working with code, it is important to handle errors correctly. If you ignore errors, your code may crash or produce incorrect results.

**5. Not using comments**

Comments are a great way to document your code and make it easier for other people to understand. By using comments, you can explain what your code is doing and why.

**6. Using too much memory**

When you are working with large data sets, it is important to be aware of how much memory your code is using. If your code uses too much memory, it may slow down your computer or even crash.

**7. Not being efficient**

There are many ways to write code that accomplishes the same task. However, some ways of writing code are more efficient than others. By writing efficient code, you can make your programs run faster and use less memory.

**8. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code regularly to make sure that it is working correctly. By testing your code, you can catch bugs early and prevent them from causing problems in production.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1111_A. Superhero Transformation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly identifying vowels and consonants.** The problem states that "we consider the letters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' to be vowels and all the other letters to be consonants." A developer who incorrectly identifies vowels and consonants will not be able to solve the problem correctly.
2. **Not considering all possible combinations of vowel and consonant changes.** The problem states that "s can be made equal to t by changing any vowel in s to any other vowel and any consonant in s to any other consonant." A developer who does not consider all possible combinations of vowel and consonant changes may incorrectly conclude that two strings cannot be transformed into each other when they actually can.
3. **Using incorrect logic to determine if two strings can be transformed into each other.** The problem states that "s can be made equal to t by changing any vowel in s to any other vowel and any consonant in s to any other consonant." A developer who uses incorrect logic to determine if two strings can be transformed into each other may incorrectly conclude that two strings can be transformed into each other when they actually cannot.
4. **Mishandling input or output.** The problem states that "The first line contains the string s having length between 1 and 1000, inclusive. The second line contains the string t having length between 1 and 1000, inclusive." A developer who mishandles input or output may not be able to solve the problem correctly.
5. **Other errors.** There are a number of other errors that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These errors include, but are not limited to, the following:
    * Using incorrect data types
    * Using incorrect algorithms
    * Making incorrect assumptions
    * Not testing the code thoroughly

Title:
CODEFORCES 1140_F. Extending Set of Points

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the extension algorithm.** The extension algorithm is not trivial, and it is easy to make mistakes when implementing it. For example, one common mistake is to forget to check whether the point (x_2, y_2) is already in R before adding it. Another common mistake is to add the point (x_2, y_2) to R even if it is not strictly necessary.
2. **Incorrect handling of queries.** The problem statement specifies that you must process two types of queries: add some point to S, or remove some point from it. It is important to make sure that you are processing the queries correctly. For example, you should not add a point to S if it is already in S, and you should not remove a point from S if it is not in S.
3. **Incorrect output.** The problem statement specifies that you must print q integers. i-th integer should be equal to the size of E(S) after processing first i queries. It is important to make sure that you are printing the correct output. For example, you should not print the size of S instead of the size of E(S).
4. **Memory errors.** The problem statement does not specify any constraints on the amount of memory that you can use. However, it is important to be aware of the possibility of memory errors. For example, if you are using a recursive algorithm, you need to make sure that you do not recurse too deeply.
5. **Time limit exceeded.** The problem statement specifies a time limit of 3 seconds. It is important to make sure that your solution runs within this time limit. For example, you should avoid using computationally expensive algorithms.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1159_D. The minimal unique substring

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data is given as two integers n and k. However, the developer may accidentally use the wrong data type, such as strings or floats. This can lead to incorrect results or errors.

**2. Using incorrect operators**

The problem statement specifies that the length of the minimal unique substring should be equal to k. However, the developer may accidentally use the wrong operator, such as < or >. This can lead to incorrect results or errors.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The problem statement requires the developer to find a string s of length n, consisting of symbols "0" and "1". However, the developer may accidentally use incorrect logic, such as using a loop that iterates over the string multiple times. This can lead to incorrect results or errors.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement specifies that (n mod 2) = (k mod 2). However, the developer may not handle this edge case correctly. This can lead to incorrect results or errors.

**5. Using inefficient algorithms**

The problem statement does not specify a time limit for the solution. However, the developer may use an inefficient algorithm, such as a brute-force approach. This can lead to slow performance and timeouts.

**6. Not testing the code**

The developer should always test their code before submitting it. This will help to catch errors and identify problems.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1181_D. Irrigation

Pain points:
**Possible Problems and Bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is `1 2 3`, the program will expect three integers, but only two are provided. This will cause the program to crash.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correctly formatted, which can make it difficult to read and understand. For example, if the output is `1,2,3`, the program will print the three numbers on separate lines, which can be confusing.
* **Incorrect logic:** The program may contain incorrect logic, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may incorrectly calculate the number of times a city has hosted the olympiad, which will lead to the wrong city being selected as the host.
* **Memory leaks:** The program may not properly release memory that it has allocated, which can lead to a memory leak. A memory leak can eventually cause the program to crash.
* **Race conditions:** The program may not be thread-safe, which can lead to incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.
* **Security vulnerabilities:** The program may contain security vulnerabilities, which can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or its data.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design and implement the program. The program should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and does not contain any bugs. The program should also be monitored for memory leaks and security vulnerabilities.

The problem specifies that the arrays are compared lexicographically. However, the developer may accidentally use the wrong comparison operator, such as `>` or `<`, instead of `<=` or `>=`. This will cause the incorrect array to be printed.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a simple algorithm that iteratively builds the array from left to right. However, the developer may accidentally use an incorrect algorithm, such as a recursive algorithm, which will not work correctly.

**4. Not handling all possible cases**

The problem specifies that the input data may contain multiple correct bracket arrays. However, the developer may accidentally only handle the case where there is a single correct bracket array. This will cause the incorrect array to be printed.

**5. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved in O(n * m) time using a simple algorithm. However, the developer may accidentally use a more complex algorithm, such as a dynamic programming algorithm, which will take O(n ^ 2 * m ^ 2) time.

Title:
CODEFORCES 125_D. Two progressions

Pain points:
**1. The input data may not be valid.** For example, the input may contain a negative number that is greater than 108, or a number that is not an integer. The developer should check the input data for validity and raise an error if it is not valid.
2. The developer may not correctly implement the algorithm for splitting a sequence into two arithmetic progressions. The algorithm is fairly simple, but it is easy to make mistakes. The developer should carefully review their code to make sure that it is correct.
3. The developer may not correctly format the output. The output should be two lines, each of which contains a list of numbers in an arithmetic progression. The numbers in each list should be separated by spaces. The developer should make sure that the output is formatted correctly.
4. The developer may not handle all possible cases. For example, the input may contain a sequence that cannot be split into two arithmetic progressions. The developer should handle this case gracefully and print an appropriate error message.
5. The developer may not be able to optimize their code. The algorithm for splitting a sequence into two arithmetic progressions is not very efficient. The developer should try to optimize their code as much as possible.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1325_F. Ehab's Last Theorem

Pain points:
 ### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format for this problem is very specific. It expects two integers `n` and `m` on the first line, followed by `m` lines of two integers each. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly and will likely crash.

### 2. Incorrect graph representation

The input graph must be a connected graph with no self-loops or multiple edges. If the graph is not connected, the program will not be able to find a simple cycle of length at least `√n`. If the graph contains self-loops or multiple edges, the program will not be able to find an independent set of size `√n`.

### 3. Incorrect algorithm

The algorithm used to find a simple cycle of length at least `√n` or an independent set of size `√n` must be correct. If the algorithm is incorrect, the program will not be able to find the desired solution.

### 4. Incorrect output format

The output for this problem must be in the following format:

```
1
<list of vertices in the independent set>
```

or

```
2
<length of the cycle>
<list of vertices in the cycle>
```

If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be graded correctly.

### 5. Runtime errors

The program must be able to run within the time limit specified by the problem. If the program runs too slowly, it will not be graded correctly.

### 6. Memory errors

The program must not use more memory than the amount specified by the problem. If the program uses too much memory, it will not be graded correctly.

### 7. Other errors

There are a number of other possible errors that could occur when solving this problem. These include:

* Errors in the data structures used to represent the graph
* Errors in the algorithms used to find a simple cycle of length at least `√n` or an independent set of size `√n`
* Errors in the code that prints the output
* Errors in the code that handles errors

It is important to be aware of all of these possible errors and to take steps to avoid them.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1344_E. Train Tracks

Pain points:
### Possible Problems

* **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain invalid characters or the number of lines may not match the expected number.
* **Incorrect data**. The input data may be incorrect. For example, the railroads may not form a tree rooted at station 1, or the trains may not be able to reach their destinations.
* **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm may not be correct. For example, the algorithm may not find the latest possible time of the first explosion or the minimum number of switch changes required to achieve this.
* **Incorrect implementation**. The implementation of the algorithm may be incorrect. For example, the implementation may have bugs or it may not be efficient enough.

### Possible Bugs

* **Off-by-one errors**. The algorithm may make off-by-one errors when computing the latest possible time of the first explosion or the minimum number of switch changes required to achieve this.
* **Incorrect data structures**. The algorithm may use incorrect data structures to store the railroads, trains, or other information. This can lead to incorrect results or slow performance.
* **Incorrect logic**. The algorithm may contain incorrect logic. This can lead to incorrect results or slow performance.
* **Memory leaks**. The algorithm may not free memory that it has allocated. This can lead to a memory leak and eventually cause the program to crash.
* **Synchronization issues**. The algorithm may not be thread-safe. This can lead to incorrect results or data corruption.

### How to Avoid These Problems

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input format and output format. It is also important to test the algorithm with a variety of input data to ensure that it is correct. Finally, it is important to use good programming practices, such as using the correct data structures and avoiding off-by-one errors, to reduce the risk of bugs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1366_E. Two Arrays

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of binary search**

A common mistake is to implement binary search incorrectly. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
def binary_search(array, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(array) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if array[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif array[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

The problem with this code is that it does not check for the case where the target is not found in the array. In this case, the code will return -1, which is not the correct answer.

To fix this, we can add a check at the end of the loop to see if the left and right pointers have crossed. If they have, then the target is not in the array and we can return -1.

```
def binary_search(array, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(array) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if array[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif array[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    # Check if the target is not in the array
    if left > right:
        return -1
```

**2. Off-by-one errors**

Another common mistake is to make an off-by-one error. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
def count_ways(n, m, a, b):
    # Initialize the dp array
    dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    # Base case
    dp[0][0] = 1

    # Recursively fill in the dp array
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            # Check if the current element is less than or equal to the current minimum
            if a[i - 1] <= b[j - 1]:
                # Add the number of ways to divide the array up to the current element
                # with the current minimum
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]
            else:
                # The current element is greater than the current minimum, so we cannot
                # divide the array up to the current element with the current minimum
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]

    # Return the number of ways to divide the array
    return dp[n][m]
```

The problem with this code is that the base case is incorrect. The base case should be dp[0][0] = 1, not dp[0][1] = 1. This is because the dp array is indexed from 0, not 1.

To fix this, we can simply change the base case to dp[0][0] = 1.

```
def count_ways(n, m, a, b):
    # Initialize the dp array
    dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    # Base case
    dp[0][0] = 1

    # Recursively fill in the dp array
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            # Check if the current element is less than or equal to the current minimum
            if a[i - 1] <= b[j - 1]:
                # Add the number of ways to divide the array up to the current element
                # with the current minimum
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]
            else:
                # The current element is greater than the current minimum, so we cannot
                # divide

Title:
CODEFORCES 1408_E. Avoid Rainbow Cycles

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, you might forget to add a space between two integers, or you might accidentally add a newline character. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The data types of the input values must be correct. For example, you cannot pass a string to an integer variable. This will cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When iterating over a list or array, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one element. This can cause the program to skip over an important part of the input or to process the same element twice.

**4. Logical errors**

The most common type of error is a logical error. This is when the program does not do what you intended it to do. For example, you might write a function to find the maximum value in a list, but the function returns the minimum value instead.

**5. Undefined behavior**

Undefined behavior is when the program does something that is not specified in the language's specification. This can happen when you divide by zero, or when you access a memory location that is out of bounds. Undefined behavior is dangerous because it can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**6. Security vulnerabilities**

A security vulnerability is a weakness in the program that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system. Security vulnerabilities can be caused by a variety of factors, such as incorrect input validation, insecure coding practices, and poor design decisions.

**7. Performance issues**

The program's performance can be affected by a number of factors, such as the algorithm used, the data structures used, and the compiler options used. It is important to optimize the program's performance so that it runs as fast as possible.

**8. Maintainability issues**

The program's maintainability can be affected by a number of factors, such as the use of comments, the use of descriptive variable names, and the use of modular design. It is important to write maintainable code so that it is easy to understand and modify.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1526_B. I Hate 1111

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specified in the problem statement is `t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000) — the number of testcases.

   ```
The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000) — the number of testcases.

The first and only line of each testcase contains a single integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) — the number you have to make.

Output

For each testcase, you should output a single string. If you can make x, output "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise, output "NO".

You can print each letter of "YES" and "NO" in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input


3
33
144
69


Output


YES
YES
NO
```

If the input format is not correct, the program may crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the input contains more than one integer on the first line, the program may crash.

2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specified in the problem statement is `YES` or `NO`.

   ```
Output

For each testcase, you should output a single string. If you can make x, output "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise, output "NO".

You can print each letter of "YES" and "NO" in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input


3
33
144
69


Output


YES
YES
NO
```

If the output format is not correct, the program may not be accepted by the judge. For example, if the output contains spaces or punctuation marks, the program may not be accepted.

3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program must be correct in order to produce the correct output. For example, the following program is incorrect:

   ```
def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        if x % 11 == 0:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program will not work correctly because it does not check if `x` is divisible by 111 or 1111. To fix this, we can add the following code:

   ```
def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        if x % 11 == 0 or x % 111 == 0 or x % 1111 == 0:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

4. **Incorrect data type.** The data type of the variables must be correct in order for the program to work correctly. For example, the following program is incorrect:

   ```
def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = input()
        if x % 11 == 0:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program will not work correctly because the variable `x` is a string, not an integer. To fix this, we can change the type of `x` to an integer:

   ```
def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        if x % 11 == 0:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

CODEFORCES 157_E. Cipher

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very clear. It is not explicitly stated that the input should be a list of strings, and it is not clear how to handle empty strings. This could lead to a bug where the program tries to iterate over an empty list or tries to perform an operation on an empty string.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also not very clear. It is not explicitly stated that the output should be a list of integers, and it is not clear how to handle the case where there are no valid words. This could lead to a bug where the program prints an incorrect output format or tries to print a number that is too large.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the number of valid words**

The problem statement states that the number of valid words is the number of words that can be transformed into the given word by performing zero or more operations. However, the code does not correctly calculate this number. It only considers the number of words that can be transformed into the given word by performing one operation. This could lead to a bug where the program returns an incorrect answer.

**4. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

The problem statement does not explicitly state how to handle edge cases, such as the case where the given word is empty or the case where the given word is a palindrome. This could lead to a bug where the program crashes or returns an incorrect answer.

**5. Incorrect use of modular arithmetic**

The problem statement states that the answer should be modulo 1000000007. However, the code does not correctly use modular arithmetic. This could lead to a bug where the program returns an incorrect answer.

CODEFORCES 178_B2. Greedy Merchants

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect data type:** The data type of the input values may be incorrect, which can also lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one error:** An off-by-one error occurs when a programmer miscounts by one when performing an operation. For example, if a programmer is iterating over a list of numbers and tries to access the element at index n, but the list only has n - 1 elements, an off-by-one error will occur.
4. **Logic error:** A logic error occurs when a programmer makes a mistake in the logic of their code. For example, if a programmer writes a function to find the maximum value in a list, but the function returns the minimum value instead, a logic error will occur.
5. **Memory leak:** A memory leak occurs when a programmer allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race condition:** A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even a program crash.
7. **Deadlock:** A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, but neither thread can do so. This can lead to the program being stuck in an infinite loop.
8. **Stack overflow:** A stack overflow occurs when a program tries to push more data onto the stack than it can handle. This can lead to the program crashing or even the operating system crashing.
9. **Buffer overflow:** A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold. This can lead to the program crashing or even the operating system crashing.
10. **Format string vulnerability:** A format string vulnerability occurs when a program uses a format string incorrectly. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

CODEFORCES 296_C. Greg and Array

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains integers that can be up to 10^5 in size. However, the code below uses `int` to store these integers, which is not enough. This will lead to overflow errors.

```
n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

To fix this, we can use `long` or `int64` to store the integers.

```
n, m, k = map(int64, input().split())
a = list(map(int64, input().split()))
```

**2. Not handling the corner cases**

The input contains some corner cases that the code below does not handle correctly. For example, the input could contain a negative number, or a number that is larger than 10^5.

```
n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(m):
    li, ri, di = map(int, input().split())
    for j in range(li, ri + 1):
        a[j] += di

for i in range(k):
    xi, yi = map(int, input().split())
    for j in range(xi, yi + 1):
        print(a[j], end=" ")
    print()
```

To fix this, we can add some error checking to the code. For example, we can check if the input is valid and if the numbers are within the correct range.

```
n, m, k = map(int64, input().split())
a = list(map(int64, input().split()))

for i in range(m):
    li, ri, di = map(int64, input().split())
    if li < 1 or li > n or ri < 1 or ri > n or di < 0 or di > 10^5:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input")
    for j in range(li, ri + 1):
        a[j] += di

for i in range(k):
    xi, yi = map(int64, input().split())
    if xi < 1 or xi > m or yi < 1 or yi > m:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input")
    for j in range(xi, yi + 1):
        print(a[j], end=" ")
    print()
```

**3. Using the wrong algorithm**

The code below uses a simple algorithm to solve the problem. However, this algorithm is not very efficient. For example, it takes O(n^2) time to execute all the queries.

```
n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(m):
    li, ri, di = map(int, input().split())
    for j in range(li, ri + 1):
        a[j] += di

for i in range(k):
    xi, yi = map(int, input().split())
    for j in range(xi, yi + 1):
        print(a[j], end=" ")
    print()
```

A more efficient algorithm would be to use a segment tree. This would allow us to solve the problem in O(n log n) time.

```
n, m, k = map(int64, input().split())
a = list(map(int64, input().split()))

tree = SegmentTree(n)

for i in range(m):
    li, ri, di = map(int64, input().split())
    tree.update(li - 1, ri, di)

for i in range(k):
    xi, yi = map(int64, input().split())
    print(tree.query(xi - 1, yi))

CODEFORCES 344_A. Magnets

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is `n`, followed by `n` lines of input. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output for this problem should be a single integer, the number of groups of magnets. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly output the answer and will likely receive a WA verdict.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When counting the number of groups of magnets, it is important to be careful not to count any groups twice. This can be avoided by keeping track of the previous magnet's polarity and only counting a new group when the polarity changes.
4. **Memory errors.** This problem does not require a lot of memory, but it is still possible to run out of memory if the input is large. To avoid this, it is important to use an efficient data structure to store the magnets.
5. **Time errors.** This problem can be solved in O(n) time, but it is possible to write a solution that runs in O(n^2) time. To avoid this, it is important to use a efficient algorithm to solve the problem.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is `n`, followed by `n` lines of input. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash. For example, the following input is incorrect:

```
1
100
```

This input is missing the second line of input, which should contain the polarity of the first magnet. The program will not be able to correctly parse this input and will likely crash.

* **Incorrect output format:** The output for this problem should be a single integer, the number of groups of magnets. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly output the answer and will likely receive a WA verdict. For example, the following output is incorrect:

```
3 magnets
```

This output is not a single integer, so the program will likely receive a WA verdict.

* **Off-by-one errors:** When counting the number of groups of magnets, it is important to be careful not to count any groups twice. This can be avoided by keeping track of the previous magnet's polarity and only counting a new group when the polarity changes. For example, the following code will not correctly count the number of groups of magnets:

```
def count_groups(magnets):
  """Counts the number of groups of magnets in the given list."""
  groups = 0
  for i in range(len(magnets) - 1):
    if magnets[i] != magnets[i + 1]:
      groups += 1
  return groups

magnets = ['01', '10', '10', '01']
print(count_groups(magnets))
```

This code will count the first two groups of magnets correctly, but it will incorrectly count the third group as two groups. This is because the code does not keep track of the previous magnet's polarity.

* **Memory errors:** This problem does not require a lot of memory, but it is still possible to run out of memory if the input is large. To avoid this, it is important to use an efficient data structure to store the magnets. For example, the following code uses a list to store the magnets, which can be inefficient for large inputs:

```
def count_groups(magnets):
  """Counts the number of groups of magnets in the given list."""
  groups = 0
  for magnet in magnets:
    if magnet not in groups:
      groups.append(magnet)
  return len(groups)

magnets = ['01', '10', '10', '01']
print(count_groups(magnets))
```

A more efficient way to store the magnets would be to use a set, which does not allow duplicate elements. This would prevent the code from adding the same magnet to the list multiple times, which would save memory.

* **Time errors:** This problem can be solved in O(n) time, but it is possible to write a solution that runs in O(n^2) time. To avoid this, it is important to use a efficient algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the following code uses a nested for loop to count the number of groups of magnets, which is inefficient

CODEFORCES 530_G. Levenshtein distance

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one errors.** When computing the Levenshtein distance, it is important to make sure that you are correctly computing the number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions. A common error is to forget to add 1 to the index of the character being inserted or deleted, or to subtract 1 from the index of the character being substituted.
2. **Incorrect handling of equal strings.** The Levenshtein distance between two equal strings is 0. However, some implementations of the Levenshtein distance algorithm will incorrectly return 1, because they will count the substitution of the first character with itself as a cost.
3. **Incorrect handling of empty strings.** The Levenshtein distance between an empty string and any other string is the length of the other string. However, some implementations of the Levenshtein distance algorithm will incorrectly return 1, because they will count the insertion of the first character of the other string as a cost.
4. **Incorrect handling of out-of-bounds errors.** When computing the Levenshtein distance, it is important to make sure that you are not trying to access characters that are out of bounds of the strings. A common error is to try to access the character at index -1 or index len(string) + 1.
5. **Incorrect handling of invalid characters.** The Levenshtein distance algorithm assumes that the input strings are composed of valid characters. If the input strings contain invalid characters, the algorithm may produce incorrect results.
6. **Incorrect handling of multiple threads.** The Levenshtein distance algorithm can be implemented in a multi-threaded fashion. However, it is important to make sure that the threads are properly synchronized, otherwise the algorithm may produce incorrect results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 766_A. Mahmoud and Longest Uncommon Subsequence

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input strings are non-empty and consist of lowercase letters of English alphabet. The length of each string is not bigger than 105 characters. If we use a wrong data type, such as `char`, to store the input strings, we may get a runtime error when the length of the input strings exceeds the maximum value that `char` can represent.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem is asking for the length of the longest uncommon subsequence. A naive solution would be to compare all possible subsequences of one string with all possible subsequences of the other string. This would take O(n^2) time, where n is the length of the longer string. A more efficient solution would be to use dynamic programming.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When computing the length of the longest uncommon subsequence, it is important to make sure that we don't count the same character twice. For example, if the two input strings are "abc" and "cba", the longest uncommon subsequence is "ab". However, if we accidentally count the first "a" twice, we will get the incorrect answer of "ac".

**4. Incorrect boundary conditions**

When computing the length of the longest uncommon subsequence, it is important to handle the boundary conditions correctly. For example, if one of the input strings is empty, the longest uncommon subsequence is the length of the other string.

**5. Using global variables**

It is important to use local variables whenever possible. Using global variables can make it difficult to track down bugs.

**6. Not using unit tests**

Unit tests are an essential part of any software development process. They can help to catch bugs early and prevent them from causing problems in production. When solving a problem, it is always a good idea to write unit tests to verify that your code is correct.

CODEFORCES 835_E. The penguin's game

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the icicles' temperatures.**

The problem states that the temperatures of the icicles are integers from 1 to 109. However, if you accidentally use a data type that is too small to store these values, you may get incorrect results. For example, if you use a 32-bit integer, you will only be able to store temperatures up to 2^31-1, which is less than 109.

**2. Asking too many questions.**

The problem states that you cannot ask more than 19 questions. If you exceed this limit, your program will receive a "Wrong answer" verdict.

**3. Asking an invalid question.**

The problem states that you can only ask about a non-empty subset of icicles. If you ask about an empty subset, your program will receive a "Wrong answer" verdict.

**4. Not flushing the output.**

The problem states that you must flush the output after printing the final answer. If you do not do this, your program will receive an "Idleness Limit Exceeded" verdict.

**5. Using the wrong format for the hacking input.**

The problem states that the hacking input must be in the following format:

```
n x y p1 p2
```

where 1 ≤ p1 < p2 ≤ n are the indexes of the special icicles. If you do not use this format, your program will not be able to hack the problem.
Test inputs:
1. **Using the wrong data type for the icicles' temperatures.**

```
4 2 1
```

This input will cause the program to crash because it tries to store the temperature of the special icicles (which is 1) in a 32-bit integer.

2. **Asking too many questions.**

```
10 3 4
? 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
? 1 1
? 1 1
```

This input will cause the program to receive a "Wrong answer" verdict because it asks more than 19 questions.

3. **Asking an invalid question.**

```
10 3 4
? 1
```

This input will cause the program to receive a "Wrong answer" verdict because it asks about an empty subset of icicles.

4. **Not flushing the output.**

```
4 2 1
! 1 3
```

This input will cause the program to receive an "Idleness Limit Exceeded" verdict because it does not flush the output after printing the final answer.

5. **Using the wrong format for the hacking input.**

```
4 2 1 p1 p2
```

This input will cause the program to crash because it does not follow the correct format for the hacking input.

CODEFORCES 856_A. Set Theory

Pain points:
**1. The input data may be malformed.** For example, the input may contain a negative number, a number that is too large, or a number that is not an integer. The developer should check the input data for errors and return an error message if any are found.
2. The developer may not correctly implement the algorithm for finding the set B. The algorithm should find a set of n different integers such that all n2 integers that can be obtained by summing up ai and bj for all possible pairs of i and j are different. The developer should carefully check their code to make sure that it is correct.
3. The developer may not correctly format the output. The output should be a single line that contains the answer to the problem. The answer should be either "YES" or "NO". If the answer is "YES", the output should also contain the set B. The developer should carefully check their code to make sure that the output is formatted correctly.
4. The developer may not handle all of the test cases correctly. The test cases may include cases where the set A is empty, the set A contains only one element, or the set A contains duplicate elements. The developer should carefully check their code to make sure that it handles all of the test cases correctly.

CODEFORCES 906_A. Shockers

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input may contain invalid data, such as a letter that is not lowercase English.
* The input may contain duplicate letters, which would make it impossible to uniquely determine the selected letter.
* The input may not contain enough information to uniquely determine the selected letter.
* The output may be incorrect if the selected letter is not a letter that appears in any of the words that Valentin says.
* The output may be incorrect if Valentin makes a guess about the selected letter that is not correct.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input and output for correctness. It is also important to use a robust algorithm to uniquely determine the selected letter, even if the input contains invalid data.

Title:
CODEFORCES 926_C. Is This a Zebra?

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not specified in the problem statement. The developer may assume that the input format is different from what is actually expected, which could lead to incorrect results.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not specified in the problem statement. The developer may assume that the output format is different from what is actually expected, which could lead to incorrect results.
* **Incorrect algorithm:** The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. This could lead to incorrect results or timeouts.
* **Incorrect data type:** The developer may use an incorrect data type to store the input data. This could lead to incorrect results or overflow errors.
* **Off-by-one error:** The developer may make an off-by-one error when calculating the width of a stripe or the number of stripes. This could lead to incorrect results.
* **Memory leak:** The developer may not properly free the memory allocated for the input data or the intermediate results. This could lead to a memory leak, which could eventually crash the program.
* **Timeout:** The developer's algorithm may take too long to run. This could lead to a timeout, which means that the program will be terminated before it can finish running.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. The developer should also carefully design and implement their algorithm, and test it thoroughly to ensure that it produces the correct results.
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect input format:**

```
n = 100000
a = [0 for _ in range(n)]
```

This input is incorrect because it does not specify the width of the photo.

2. **Incorrect output format:**

```
print('YES')
```

This output is incorrect because it does not follow the output format specified in the problem statement.

3. **Incorrect algorithm:**

```
def is_zebra(n, a):
  """Checks if the given photo can be a photo of zebra."""

  # Check if the width of the photo is even.

  if n % 2 != 0:
    return False

  # Check if all stripes have equal width.

  for i in range(n // 2):
    if a[i] != a[i + n // 2]:
      return False

  return True


n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

if is_zebra(n, a):
  print('YES')
else:
  print('NO')
```

This algorithm is incorrect because it does not consider the case where the photo contains only one stripe.

4. **Incorrect data type:**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

if is_zebra(n, a):
  print('YES')
else:
  print('NO')
```

This code is incorrect because it uses the `int` data type to store the width of the photo, which could lead to overflow errors.

5. **Off-by-one error:**

```
def is_zebra(n, a):
  """Checks if the given photo can be a photo of zebra."""

  # Check if the width of the photo is even.

  if n % 2 != 0:
    return False

  # Check if all stripes have equal width.

  for i in range(n // 2):
    if a[i] != a[i + n // 2 - 1]:
      return False

  return True


n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

if is_zebra(n, a):
  print('YES')
else:
  print('NO')
```

This code is incorrect because it makes an off-by-one error when calculating the width of the stripes.

6. **Memory leak:**

```
def is_zebra(n, a):

  # Check if the width of the photo is even.

  if n % 2 != 0:
    return False

  # Check if all stripes have equal width.

  return True


n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

if is_zebra(n, a):
  print('YES')
else:
  print('NO')
```

This code is incorrect because it does not properly free the memory allocated for the input data.

7. **Timeout:**

```
def is_zebra(n, a):
  """Checks if the given photo can be a photo of zebra."""

  # Check if the width of the photo is even.

  if n % 2 != 0:

  return True


n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

if is_zebra(n, a):
  print('YES')

Title:
CODEFORCES 955_A. Feed the cat

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is two integers hh and mm, followed by four integers H, D, C, and N. Make sure that your input code correctly parses the input data.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the cat's hunger level.** The cat's hunger level increases by D points each minute. Make sure that you correctly calculate the cat's hunger level at each time step.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of buns needed to feed the cat.** The number of buns needed to feed the cat is equal to the cat's hunger level divided by the number of points that each bun decreases hunger by. Make sure that you correctly calculate the number of buns needed.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the total cost of the buns.** The total cost of the buns is equal to the number of buns multiplied by the cost of each bun. Make sure that you correctly calculate the total cost of the buns.
5. **Incorrect rounding of the total cost of the buns.** The total cost of the buns must be rounded to three decimal digits. Make sure that you correctly round the total cost of the buns.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use the `int` data type to store the input integers. This will prevent errors caused by incorrect typecasting.
* Use the `str.split()` method to split the input string into an array of strings. This will make it easier to access the individual input values.
* Use the `int()` function to convert the input strings to integers. This will prevent errors caused by incorrect parsing of the input data.
* Use the `math.ceil()` function to round the total cost of the buns to three decimal digits. This will ensure that the output is correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 981_C. Useful Decomposition

Pain points:
**1. Input format**

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^{5}) the number of nodes in the tree.

Each of the next n - 1 lines contains two integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i) — the edges of the tree. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

**2. Output format**

If there are no decompositions, print the only line containing "No".

Otherwise in the first line print "Yes", and in the second line print the number of paths in the decomposition m. 

Each of the next m lines should contain two integers u_i, v_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n, u_i ≠ v_i) denoting that one of the paths in the decomposition is the simple path between nodes u_i and v_i. 

Each pair of paths in the decomposition should have at least one common vertex, and each edge of the tree should be presented in exactly one path. You can print the paths and the ends of each path in arbitrary order.

**3. Possible problems**

* The input may contain invalid data. For example, the number of nodes may be less than 2, or the edges may not form a tree.
* The input may be too large to fit in memory.
* The output may be too large to fit in the output buffer.
* The algorithm may not terminate in a reasonable amount of time.
* The algorithm may not produce the correct output.

**4. Possible bugs**

* The algorithm may not handle invalid input correctly.
* The algorithm may not be efficient enough to handle large inputs.
* The algorithm may not produce the correct output.

**5. How to avoid these problems**

* Be careful to check the input for validity.
* Use an efficient algorithm to solve the problem.
* Test your algorithm on a variety of inputs to make sure it produces the correct output.

2. **Incorrectly identifying the ending position of Little Arjit's army.** The ending position of Little Arjit's army is denoted by the last 'X' in the input string. If the developer incorrectly identifies the ending position, the number of enemies that survive will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrectly identifying the enemies.** The enemies are denoted by the letter 'O' in the input string. If the developer incorrectly identifies the enemies, the number of enemies that survive will be incorrect.
4. **Incorrectly identifying the fire.** The fire is denoted by the letter '*' in the input string. If the developer incorrectly identifies the fire, the number of enemies that survive will be incorrect.
5. **Incorrectly implementing the algorithm.** The algorithm for counting the number of enemies that survive is as follows:

   1. Iterate through the input string from left to right.
   2. If the current character is an 'X', move to the next character.
   3. If the current character is an 'O', increment the number of enemies that survive.
   4. If the current character is a '*', break out of the loop.

If the developer incorrectly implements the algorithm, the number of enemies that survive will be incorrect.

HACKEREARTH find-the-triangle-3

Pain points:
1. **Not handling invalid input.** The input may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers that are too large. The developer should check for these values and handle them appropriately.
2. **Not handling duplicate values.** The input may contain duplicate values, such as two sticks with the same length. The developer should handle these values by only considering each value once.
3. **Not finding all possible triangles.** The developer may only find a subset of the possible triangles, or may not find any triangles at all. The developer should use a brute-force approach to find all possible triangles.
4. **Not finding the triangle with the maximum perimeter.** The developer may find a triangle with a smaller perimeter than the optimal triangle. The developer should use a greedy algorithm to find the triangle with the maximum perimeter.
5. **Not printing the output in the correct format.** The developer should print the output in the format specified in the problem statement.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use a robust input validation library to check for invalid input values.
* Use a set data structure to store the unique values of the sticks. This will prevent the developer from considering duplicate values.
* Use a brute-force algorithm to find all possible triangles. This will ensure that the developer finds all of the possible triangles.
* Use a greedy algorithm to find the triangle with the maximum perimeter. This will ensure that the developer finds the triangle with the largest perimeter.
* Use a unit test framework to test the code. This will help the developer catch bugs early and prevent them from being released into production.

Title:
HACKEREARTH inter-city-travel-3

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modular arithmetic.** When computing the number of ways to travel from city i to city j by exactly taking a time of P hours, it is important to use modular arithmetic to ensure that the answer is correct. For example, if the number of ways to travel from city i to city j is 1000 and P is 10, then the answer should be 0, not 1000.
2. **Incorrect array indexing.** When iterating over the adjacency list of a city, it is important to make sure that you are indexing the array correctly. For example, if the adjacency list of a city is [1, 2, 3], then the third element of the array is 3, not 4.
3. **Incorrect use of memoization.** Memoization is a technique that can be used to speed up recursive algorithms. However, it is important to use memoization correctly in order to avoid bugs. For example, if you are memoizing the number of ways to travel from city i to city j by exactly taking a time of P hours, you need to make sure that you are only memoizing the values of P that are less than or equal to the current value of P. Otherwise, you will end up with incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect use of dynamic programming.** Dynamic programming is a technique that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. However, it is important to use dynamic programming correctly in order to avoid bugs. For example, if you are using dynamic programming to solve the knapsack problem, you need to make sure that you are only considering items that fit in the knapsack. Otherwise, you will end up with incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect use of bit manipulation.** Bit manipulation is a powerful technique that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. However, it is important to use bit manipulation correctly in order to avoid bugs. For example, if you are using bit manipulation to compute the number of bits set in a number, you need to make sure that you are using the correct operator. Otherwise, you will end up with incorrect results.

Title:
HACKEREARTH ones-and-zeros-and-minus-ones

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the array elements.** The input array contains only 0, -1, and 1, so it is tempting to use an integer array to store the elements. However, this can lead to problems if the array contains a negative number, as the integer type will not be able to represent the negative number correctly. To avoid this problem, you should use a signed integer type, such as `int32_t` or `int64_t`.
2. **Using the wrong data type for the function f.** The function f is defined as the ratio of the number of 1s to the number of -1s in the subarray. If the subarray contains no -1s, then the function f will be 0. However, if you try to divide by 0, you will get an error. To avoid this problem, you should check for the case where y == 0 before dividing x by y.
3. **Not using the most reduced fraction form.** The output format for the problem requires the function f to be printed in the most reduced fraction form. This means that the numerator and denominator should have no common factors other than 1. To achieve this, you can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator.
4. **Using an inefficient algorithm.** The problem can be solved in O(n) time using a simple greedy algorithm. However, there are more efficient algorithms that can be used to solve the problem in O(log n) time.
5. **Not handling edge cases correctly.** The problem statement specifies that the input array will contain only 0, -1, and 1. However, it is possible that the input array could contain other values. If this happens, you should handle the edge case by either returning an invalid output or by terminating the program.

HACKEREARTH the-wars-to-come-7

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The variable `N` should be an integer, but it is a string in the following code:

```
N = input()
```

2. **Incorrect comparison:** The following code will always return `True`:

```
if N == '1':
    print(1)
```

This is because the string `'1'` is always equal to the integer `1`.

3. **Incorrect indentation:** The following code is not indented correctly:

```
if N == '1':
    print(1)
else:
    print(2)
```

The correct indentation is:

```
if N == '1':

```

4. **Missing semicolon:** The following code is missing a semicolon:

```
if N == '1':

The correct code is:

```
if N == '1':
    print(1)

1. **Incorrect input type.** The input is an integer, but the developer may accidentally use a float or a string. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator.** The problem states that x is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1. The developer may accidentally use the wrong comparison operator, such as `>` or `<`, which would cause the program to produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect output format.** The problem states that the output should be 1 if x is equal to 0 and 0 if x is equal to 1. The developer may accidentally print the output in the wrong format, such as `1` or `0`, which would cause the program to produce incorrect output.
4. **Off-by-one error.** The developer may accidentally miscalculate the value of x, which would cause the program to produce incorrect output.
5. **Logical error.** The developer may make a logical error in their code, such as using the wrong variable or forgetting to check a condition. This would cause the program to produce incorrect output.

Title:
ATCODER p02811 AtCoder Beginner Contest 150 - 500 Yen Coins

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input is given in the format `K X`, where `K` is the number of 500-yen coins and `X` is the target amount of yen. If we use the `int` data type to store `K` and `X`, we may encounter an overflow error if `K` or `X` is too large. To avoid this, we should use the `long long` data type.

**2. Not considering the case where `K` is 0**

The problem statement states that `1 \leq K \leq 100`, but it does not specify what happens if `K` is 0. If we simply check if `K * 500 >= X`, we will get the wrong answer if `K` is 0. To avoid this, we should explicitly check if `K` is 0 and print `No` in that case.

**3. Not considering the case where `X` is not a multiple of 500**

The problem statement states that `1 \leq X \leq 10^5`, but it does not specify what happens if `X` is not a multiple of 500. If we simply check if `K * 500 >= X`, we will get the wrong answer if `X` is not a multiple of 500. To avoid this, we should explicitly check if `X` is a multiple of 500 and print `No` in that case.

**4. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The naive algorithm for solving this problem is to check if `K * 500 >= X`. However, this algorithm is not efficient, as it requires a O(1) time complexity. A more efficient algorithm is to use binary search. Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half until the target element is found. In this case, the search space is the set of all possible values of `K`. We can start by setting the left and right boundaries of the search space to 0 and 100, respectively. Then, we repeatedly divide the search space in half until the target element is found. To do this, we check if `K * 500 >= X`. If it does, then we set the right boundary to `K - 1`. Otherwise, we set the left boundary to `K + 1`. This process continues until the target element is found or the search space is empty.

**5. Not handling errors correctly**

There are a few potential errors that can occur when solving this problem. For example, the input data may be invalid, or the program may run out of memory. It is important to handle these errors correctly to ensure that the program terminates gracefully.

Title:
ATCODER p02948 AtCoder Beginner Contest 137 - Summer Vacation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm.** The greedy algorithm for this problem is to sort the jobs by their $A_i$ values in ascending order, and then take the jobs in that order until the deadline $M$ is reached. However, if there are two jobs with the same $A_i$ value, the greedy algorithm will incorrectly take the job with the smaller $B_i$ value. This can be fixed by breaking ties by taking the job with the larger $B_i$ value.
2. **Incorrect handling of the deadline.** The deadline $M$ is a day, so it must be an integer. However, if the input contains a non-integer value for $M$, the greedy algorithm will incorrectly crash. This can be fixed by checking that $M$ is an integer before using it in the algorithm.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum total reward.** The maximum total reward is the sum of the rewards of the jobs that are taken before the deadline $M$. However, if the deadline $M$ is less than the earliest $A_i$ value, the greedy algorithm will incorrectly return 0. This can be fixed by checking that $M$ is greater than or equal to the earliest $A_i$ value before calculating the maximum total reward.

Title:
ATCODER p03229 Tenka1 Programmer Beginner Contest - Align

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is an array of integers. If you use the wrong data type to store the array, you may get a runtime error. For example, if you use a `char` array to store the input data, you will get a runtime error when you try to access the elements of the array.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks you to find the maximum possible sum of the absolute differences between the adjacent elements. A naive solution would be to iterate through all possible permutations of the input array and find the one with the maximum sum of absolute differences. However, this solution is not efficient because it has a time complexity of O(N!). A more efficient solution is to use dynamic programming.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input array is empty. A common mistake is to assume that the maximum sum of absolute differences is 0 if the input array is empty. However, this is not always the case. For example, if the input array is `[-1]`, the maximum sum of absolute differences is 1.

**4. Using incorrect variable names**

It is important to use descriptive variable names when writing code. This makes your code more readable and easier to debug. For example, instead of using `a` to store the input array, you should use a more descriptive name such as `nums`.

**5. Forgetting to check for errors**

It is important to check for errors in your code. For example, you should check if the input array is valid before you try to access its elements. You should also check if the output array is large enough to store the results.

Title:
ATCODER p03377 AtCoder Beginner Contest 094 - Cats and Dogs

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The problem states that A and B are integers between 1 and 100, and X is an integer between 1 and 200. However, if you accidentally use a data type that is too small, you may get an incorrect answer. For example, if you use a `char` to store A, you will only be able to store values between 0 and 255, which is not enough for the problem.

**2. Not checking for overflow**

When adding A and B, you need to make sure that the result does not overflow. For example, if A is 127 and B is 128, the sum will be 255, which is too large for an integer.

**3. Using the wrong comparison operator**

The problem states that you need to check if it is possible that there are exactly X cats. This means that you need to check if X is less than or equal to A and greater than or equal to B. However, if you accidentally use the wrong comparison operator, you may get an incorrect answer. For example, if you use `>` instead of `>=`, you will incorrectly conclude that it is impossible for there to be exactly X cats.

**4. Not handling the corner cases**

The problem states that A and B must be positive integers. However, if you accidentally enter a negative value for A or B, your program will likely crash. You should always check for these corner cases and handle them appropriately.

**5. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a simple algorithm. However, if you use an incorrect algorithm, you may get an incorrect answer. For example, if you try to solve the problem by brute force, you will likely run out of time.

**6. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it. This will help you to catch any bugs and ensure that your code is correct. You can test your code by using a variety of test cases, including both positive and negative cases.

Title:
ATCODER p03544 AtCoder Beginner Contest 079 - Lucas Number

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Lucas number formula.** The Lucas number formula is $L_n = L_{n-1} + L_{n-2}$. A common mistake is to forget to subtract 1 from $n$ when calculating $L_{n-1}$ and $L_{n-2}$.
2. **Using an incorrect data type to store the Lucas number.** The Lucas number can grow very large, so it is important to use a data type that is large enough to store it. A common mistake is to use an integer data type, which can only store numbers up to a certain size.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** The Lucas number formula is recursive, so it is important to make sure that the indices are correct. A common mistake is to use the wrong index when calculating $L_{n-1}$ or $L_{n-2}$.
4. **Arithmetic overflow errors.** The Lucas number can grow very large, so it is important to be careful about arithmetic overflow errors. A common mistake is to add two numbers that are too large, which can cause the result to overflow.
5. **Incorrect input handling.** The input for this problem is a single integer. A common mistake is to read the input incorrectly, which can cause the program to crash or output incorrect results.
6. **Incorrect output formatting.** The output for this problem is a single integer. A common mistake is to format the output incorrectly, which can make it difficult to read.

Title:
ATCODER p03698 AtCoder Beginner Contest 063 - Varied

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of `set()`.** The `set()` function creates a set, which is an unordered collection of unique elements. If you try to add duplicate elements to a set, the second element will not be added. This can lead to incorrect results if you are using a set to check for duplicate elements in a list.
2. **Incorrect use of `in` operator.** The `in` operator checks whether an element is present in a list or set. If the element is not present, the `in` operator will return `False`. This can lead to incorrect results if you are using the `in` operator to check for the presence of an element in a set that does not contain the element.
3. **Incorrect use of `len()` function.** The `len()` function returns the number of elements in a list or set. If you try to use the `len()` function on an empty list or set, the `len()` function will return `0`. This can lead to incorrect results if you are using the `len()` function to check for the length of a list or set that is empty.
4. **Incorrect use of `for` loop.** The `for` loop iterates over a sequence of elements. If you try to use the `for` loop on a sequence that does not have any elements, the `for` loop will not iterate over any elements. This can lead to incorrect results if you are using the `for` loop to iterate over a sequence that is empty.
5. **Incorrect use of `if` statement.** The `if` statement checks whether a condition is true. If the condition is true, the `if` statement will execute the code block that follows the `if` statement. If the condition is false, the `if` statement will not execute the code block that follows the `if` statement. This can lead to incorrect results if you are using the `if` statement to check for a condition that is not true.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem is asking for the maximum number of pairs that Snuke can create, not the total number of cards.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm should iterate over all pairs of cards and check if they can form a pair. If they can, the number of pairs is incremented.
3. **Off-by-one error.** When checking if two cards can form a pair, it is important to make sure that the absolute value of the difference of the integers written on them is at most 1.
4. **Memory leak.** The algorithm should free any allocated memory when it is finished.
5. **Incorrect input handling.** The algorithm should check if the input is valid and handle any errors appropriately.

AIZU p00238 Time to Study

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the target time is not a number, or if the number of studies is not a number, the program may not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong type, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the start time or end time is not a number, the program may not be able to calculate the study time correctly.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When calculating the study time, it is easy to make off-by-one errors. For example, if the start time is 6:00 and the end time is 11:00, the study time is 5 hours, not 6 hours.
4. **Logic errors**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, which may cause the program to output incorrect results. For example, if the target time is 10 hours and the study time is 9 hours, the program may output "OK" instead of "1 hour shortage".
5. **Memory leaks**. The program may not release memory properly, which may cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may contain security vulnerabilities, which may allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully follow the input format, use the correct data types, and check for off-by-one errors. It is also important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it produces correct results.

Title:
AIZU p01154 Light The Room

Pain points:
```
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the number of corners is not an even integer, or the coordinates of a corner are not integers, or the coordinates of the lamp are not integers.
2. **Incorrect assumption**. The input does not meet the assumptions made in the problem statement. For example, two walls intersect or touch except for their ends, or the walls intersect or touch each other, or the walls do not turn each corner by a right angle, or the lamp does not exist strictly inside the room off the wall, or the x-coordinate of the lamp coincides with that of any wall, or the y-coordinate of the lamp coincides with that of any wall.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to calculate the length of the unilluminated part is incorrect. For example, the algorithm does not take into account all the walls of the room, or the algorithm does not take into account the fact that the walls reflect light only once, or the algorithm does not take into account the fact that the lamp is not directly on the wall.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed. For example, the output value does not have an arbitrary number of decimal digits, or the output value contains an error greater than 10-3.

Title:
AIZU p01293 Whist

Pain points:
Here are some of the most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is very specific, and it is easy to make mistakes. For example, the input should contain exactly 13 cards for each player, and each card should be represented by two characters. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to process it correctly.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is also very specific, and it is easy to make mistakes. For example, the winner should be either "NS" or "EW", and the score should be an integer. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce the correct output.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic of the program is very important, and it is easy to make mistakes. For example, the program needs to keep track of the number of tricks won by each team, and it needs to calculate the score for each team correctly. If the logic is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce the correct output.
* **Incorrect implementation:** The implementation of the program is also very important, and it is easy to make mistakes. For example, the program needs to use the correct data structures and algorithms to solve the problem efficiently. If the implementation is incorrect, the program will not be able to run correctly.

By following these tips, you can avoid some of the most common problems and bugs that developers encounter when solving this problem.

Title:
AIZU p01462 Network Reliability

Pain points:
* **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always strictly followed. For example, the input may contain spaces between numbers, or it may contain extra spaces. The developer should make sure to handle all possible input formats correctly.
* **Incorrect edge representation**. The edges in the input may be represented in different ways. For example, the edges may be represented as pairs of vertices, or they may be represented as lists of vertices. The developer should make sure to correctly parse the input and represent the edges in a consistent way.
* **Incorrect probability calculation**. The probability of an edge disappearing is calculated by multiplying the probability of each vertex disappearing. However, the developer may forget to multiply the probabilities together, or they may use the wrong probability for each vertex. The developer should make sure to correctly calculate the probability of an edge disappearing.
* **Incorrect graph connectivity calculation**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the connectivity of the graph after some edges have disappeared. For example, the developer may forget to consider the fact that some vertices may become isolated after some edges have disappeared. The developer should make sure to correctly calculate the connectivity of the graph after some edges have disappeared.

Title:
AIZU p02047 String Magic

Pain points:
```
Possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly comparing strings.** When comparing two strings, it is important to make sure that you are comparing them lexicographically. This means that you need to compare the characters in the strings from left to right, and the string that comes first in the dictionary should be considered to be less than the string that comes second. For example, the string "abc" should be considered to be less than the string "bcd".
* **Using the wrong data type.** When storing strings, it is important to use the correct data type. For example, if you are storing strings in a C++ program, you should use the `std::string` type. Using the wrong data type can lead to errors when you try to compare strings or perform other operations on them.
* **Not handling invalid input correctly.** The input for this problem may contain invalid data, such as strings that are empty or strings that contain non-alphabetic characters. It is important to handle invalid input gracefully so that your program does not crash.
* **Not using the most efficient algorithm.** There are a number of different algorithms that you could use to solve this problem. The most efficient algorithm will depend on the specific input data. It is important to choose an algorithm that is well-suited to the problem you are trying to solve.
* **Making a mistake in your code.** Even the best programmers make mistakes. It is important to carefully check your code for errors before you submit it. Some common mistakes to look for include typos, logic errors, and off-by-one errors.

Title:
AIZU p02189 Min Element

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one errors.** The most common bug is to forget to decrement `i` when checking if the next element is smaller than the current minimum. This can lead to the incorrect answer being returned.
2. **Incorrectly handling ties.** The problem statement specifies that if the minimum value appears in more than one place, the answer should be the smallest index of a minimum value. Some developers may incorrectly return the first index of a minimum value, even if there are smaller indices later in the sequence.
3. **Using incorrect data types.** The problem statement specifies that the input values can be up to 10^9, so it is important to use a data type that can represent these values. Using an incorrect data type can lead to incorrect results or errors.
4. **Not handling invalid input.** The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input is invalid. Some developers may simply ignore invalid input, which can lead to incorrect results or errors. Other developers may try to handle invalid input, but may do so incorrectly.
5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other potential bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. Some examples include:
    * Using incorrect looping logic
    * Using incorrect mathematical operations
    * Using incorrect error handling
    * Not handling edge cases

By being aware of these potential problems, developers can avoid them and write correct code.

AIZU p02343 Disjoint Set: Union Find Tree

Pain points:
1
1
1
 **1. Using the wrong data structure**

The disjoint-set data structure is a powerful tool for solving problems involving sets. However, it is important to use the correct data structure for the problem at hand. In this problem, we are given a list of queries that involve uniting and testing whether two elements are in the same set. A union-find tree is a natural choice for this problem, as it allows us to quickly unite sets and test whether two elements are in the same set.

**2. Not initializing the data structure correctly**

Before we can use a data structure, we must first initialize it. In this problem, we need to initialize a union-find tree with n nodes, where each node represents a set. We can do this by creating an array of size n, where each element in the array is initialized to its own index.

**3. Using the data structure incorrectly**

Once we have initialized the data structure, we need to use it correctly. In this problem, we need to use the union-find tree to unite sets and test whether two elements are in the same set. To unite two sets, we simply need to find the root of each set and then union the two roots. To test whether two elements are in the same set, we simply need to find the root of each element and then check if the two roots are the same.

**4. Not handling errors correctly**

It is important to handle errors correctly in any program. In this problem, we need to handle the following errors:

* The input is not valid.
* The input is too large.
* The input is too small.

We can handle these errors by checking the input before we use it. If the input is not valid, we can print an error message and exit the program. If the input is too large, we can print an error message and reduce the size of the input. If the input is too small, we can print an error message and increase the size of the input.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before you submit it. This will help you catch any bugs that you may have missed. You can test your code by running it on a few different inputs. You can also test your code by using a unit testing framework.
Test inputs:

Title:
AIZU p02476 Remainder of Big Integers

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The problem states that $A$ and $B$ can be up to $10^{1000}$, so we need to use a data type that can store such large numbers. If we use an integer type, we will get an overflow error.

**2. Using incorrect algorithms**

The naive algorithm for computing the remainder of $\frac{A}{B}$ is to repeatedly subtract $B$ from $A$ until $A$ is less than $B$. However, this algorithm will not work if $A$ is negative. A more efficient algorithm is to use the following formula:

```
R = A - (B * floor(A / B))
```

**3. Not handling special cases**

The problem states that $B \neq 0$, but we should still check for this condition to avoid a division by zero error.

**4. Using incorrect input format**

The problem states that the input should be two integers separated by a space character. If we do not follow this format, we will get an error.

**5. Not handling errors**

If any of the above problems occur, we should handle the errors gracefully. For example, we could print an error message and exit the program.
