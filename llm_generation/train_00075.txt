Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type for the stack.** The stack should be a list or array, not a string.
2. **Not initializing the stack.** The stack must be initialized before it can be used.
3. **Adding elements to the stack in the wrong order.** Elements should be added to the stack in the same order that they appear in the input string.
4. **Removing elements from the stack in the wrong order.** Elements should be removed from the stack in the opposite order that they were added.
5. **Not checking if the stack is empty before popping an element.** This will cause a `IndexError` exception.
6. **Not checking if the stack is full before pushing an element.** This will cause a `ValueError` exception.
7. **Using the wrong data type for the elements in the stack.** The elements in the stack should be strings, not integers or floats.
8. **Not handling the case where the input string contains no brackets.** The output should be `YES` in this case.
9. **Not handling the case where the input string contains unbalanced brackets.** The output should be `NO` in this case.

CODECHEF comm3

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input specifies that the range of the transceivers is `R â‰¤ 1,000`, but the code uses `int` to store `R`. This can lead to incorrect results if `R` is greater than `2147483647`.
2. **Incorrect calculation of distance**. The code uses the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the distance between two points. However, this is only accurate if the points are on a flat plane. If the points are on a curved surface, the distance will be different.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code checks if each pair of people can communicate directly. However, it does not check if all three people can communicate with each other. This can lead to incorrect results if there is a path between two people that does not go through the third person.
4. **Incorrect output**. The code outputs `yes` if any two people can communicate directly. However, the problem statement requires that all three people can communicate with each other. This can lead to incorrect results if there are two people who can communicate directly, but the third person cannot communicate with either of them.

To avoid these problems, the developer should use the following techniques:

1. Use the `long` data type to store `R`. This will prevent the code from overflowing if `R` is greater than `2147483647`.
2. Use the `hypot()` function to calculate the distance between two points. This function takes into account the curvature of the Earth and will return the correct distance even if the points are not on a flat plane.
3. Check if all three people can communicate with each other. This can be done by using a graph data structure to represent the relationships between people. Each person is represented by a vertex in the graph, and an edge is added between two vertices if the corresponding people can communicate directly. Then, a depth-first search or breadth-first search can be used to find a path between any two vertices in the graph. If there is a path between all three vertices, then all three people can communicate with each other.
4. Output `no` if there is no path between all three vertices in the graph.

Title:
CODECHEF gcd2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator (%).** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 returns 1, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1. However, if you try to use the modulo operator on two very large numbers, you may get an incorrect result. This is because the modulo operator only works on the last few digits of a number. For example, 1000000000000000000 % 3 returns 0, even though 1000000000000000000 is not divisible by 3.
2. **Incorrect use of the division operator (/).** The division operator (/) returns the quotient of a division operation. For example, 10 / 3 returns 3, because 10 divided by 3 is equal to 3. However, if you try to use the division operator on two very large numbers, you may get an incorrect result. This is because the division operator only works on the first few digits of a number. For example, 1000000000000000000 / 3 returns 333333333333333333, even though 1000000000000000000 is not evenly divisible by 3.
3. **Using the wrong data type.** When working with very large numbers, it is important to use the correct data type. For example, if you are working with numbers that are up to 250 digits long, you should use the `long long` data type. Using the wrong data type can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Not using enough precision.** When working with very large numbers, it is important to use enough precision. For example, if you are working with numbers that are up to 250 digits long, you should use at least 100 digits of precision. Using too little precision can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Not using the right algorithm.** There are many different algorithms for computing the GCD of two numbers. The most efficient algorithm for computing the GCD of two very large numbers is the Euclidean algorithm. Using the wrong algorithm can lead to incorrect results or to very slow execution times.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not described clearly. For example, it is not clear whether the input string can contain spaces.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not described clearly. For example, it is not clear whether the output should contain a newline character.
3. **Incorrect data type**. The input and output data types are not specified. For example, it is not clear whether the input string should be represented as a string or a list of characters.
4. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm may not be correct. For example, it may not work for all input cases.
5. **Incorrect implementation**. The implementation of the algorithm may contain bugs. For example, it may not handle edge cases correctly.
6. **Incorrect testing**. The test cases may not be comprehensive or may not test all aspects of the algorithm. This can lead to bugs that are not caught until the program is deployed in production.
7. **Incorrect documentation**. The documentation may not be clear or may not be complete. This can make it difficult for other developers to understand how to use the program.
8. **Incorrect deployment**. The program may be deployed in a way that makes it vulnerable to attack. For example, it may be deployed without proper security measures.

Title:
CODECHEF prpaln

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly checking if a string is a palindrome.** A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards and forwards. For example, "racecar" is a palindrome, but "apple" is not. To check if a string is a palindrome, you can use the following algorithm:

```
def is_palindrome(s):
  # Check if the string is empty or has only one character.
  if len(s) <= 1:
    return True

  # Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning of the string and one at the end.
  left = 0
  right = len(s) - 1

  # While the two pointers haven't met, check if the characters at each pointer are the same.
  while left < right:
    if s[left] != s[right]:
      return False

    # Move the pointers inwards.
    left += 1
    right -= 1

  # The string is a palindrome.
  return True
```

2. **Deleting the wrong character from a string.** When deleting a character from a string, it is important to make sure that you delete the correct character. For example, if you are trying to make the string "racecar" into a palindrome by deleting one character, you should delete the letter "e". If you delete the letter "r", the resulting string "raceca" is not a palindrome.

3. **Not handling edge cases.** When solving a problem, it is important to think about all of the possible edge cases. For example, the problem statement for this problem specifies that the string must be deleted exactly one character. If you try to delete more than one character, the resulting string will not be a palindrome.

4. **Using inefficient algorithms.** When solving a problem, it is important to use an efficient algorithm. For example, the algorithm for checking if a string is a palindrome that is listed above is O(n), where n is the length of the string. There are more efficient algorithms for checking if a string is a palindrome, such as the Manacher algorithm, which is O(n).

Title:
CODECHEF tf01

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the subset sum algorithm.** The subset sum algorithm is a recursive algorithm that takes a set of integers and a target sum as input and returns true if there exists a subset of the input set whose sum is equal to the target sum, and false otherwise. There are a number of ways to implement this algorithm, but one common way is to use a backtracking approach. This means that the algorithm starts by considering all possible subsets of the input set, and recursively checks each subset to see if its sum is equal to the target sum. If a subset is found whose sum is equal to the target sum, the algorithm returns true. Otherwise, the algorithm returns false.

One common bug that developers make when implementing the subset sum algorithm is to forget to check if the target sum is less than the sum of any of the elements in the input set. If this is the case, then the algorithm will never terminate, as it will continue to consider subsets of the input set that are impossible to have a sum equal to the target sum.

Another common bug that developers make when implementing the subset sum algorithm is to forget to check if the target sum is greater than the sum of all of the elements in the input set. If this is the case, then the algorithm will never find a subset whose sum is equal to the target sum.

2. **Incorrect input validation.** The input to the subset sum problem is a set of integers and a target sum. It is important to validate the input to ensure that it is in the correct format and that it contains valid values. One common mistake that developers make is to forget to check if the number of integers in the input set is equal to the number of elements in the target sum. If this is not the case, then the algorithm will not be able to find a solution.

Another common mistake that developers make is to forget to check if the integers in the input set are all non-negative. If this is not the case, then the algorithm will not be able to find a solution.

3. **Incorrect output formatting.** The output of the subset sum problem is a boolean value indicating whether or not there exists a subset of the input set whose sum is equal to the target sum. It is important to format the output correctly so that it is easy to understand. One common mistake that developers make is to forget to put a space between the boolean value and the newline character.

Another common mistake that developers make is to output the wrong boolean value. This can happen if the developer makes a mistake in the implementation of the subset sum algorithm.

4. **Incorrect error handling.** The subset sum problem can throw a number of errors, such as a divide by zero error or an out of memory error. It is important to handle these errors gracefully so that the program does not crash. One common mistake that developers make is to ignore these errors or to handle them incorrectly. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

5. **Incorrect use of resources.** The subset sum problem can be computationally expensive, especially for large input sets. It is important to use resources efficiently so that the program does not run out of memory or time. One common mistake that developers make is to allocate too much memory or to use too much CPU time. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

CODEFORCES 1012_E. Cycle sort

Pain points:
**Possible problems:**

1. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over the array, it is easy to make a mistake and iterate one index too far or not far enough. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrectly handling edge cases.** The problem statement specifies some specific edge cases, such as an empty array or an array that is already sorted. It is important to handle these cases correctly, or the solution will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrectly calculating the sum of cycle lengths.** When computing the sum of cycle lengths, it is easy to make a mistake and forget to include a cycle or include it twice. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Inefficient algorithms.** The problem can be solved in O(n log n) time, but it is possible to write a solution that runs in O(n^2) time or even worse. It is important to choose an efficient algorithm, or the solution will be too slow.
5. **Memory leaks.** When allocating and freeing memory, it is important to make sure to do so correctly. Memory leaks can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.

**Possible bugs:**

1. **Undefined behavior.** The problem statement does not specify what should happen if the input is invalid. If the input is invalid, the solution may behave in an undefined way, such as crashing or returning incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect output.** The solution may output incorrect results, such as a negative number of operations or a cycle that does not sort the array.
3. **Uncaught exceptions.** The solution may throw an exception that is not caught. This can cause the program to crash.
4. **Security vulnerabilities.** The solution may contain security vulnerabilities, such as a buffer overflow or a SQL injection vulnerability. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain access to the system.

It is important to avoid these problems when solving the problem. By following the tips below, you can help to ensure that your solution is correct and efficient.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1081_G. Mergesort Strikes Back

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the merge sort algorithm.** The merge sort algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the input array into two halves until each half contains a single element, and then merges the two halves together. A common mistake is to incorrectly implement the merge step, which can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the expected number of inversions.** The expected number of inversions is a function of the number of elements in the array and the maximum depth of recursion. A common mistake is to incorrectly calculate this function, which can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. A common mistake is to incorrectly use the modulo operator, which can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect input or output formatting.** The input and output of the problem should be formatted correctly. A common mistake is to incorrectly format the input or output, which can lead to the problem being rejected by the judge.
5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:

CODEFORCES 1170_E. Sliding Doors

Pain points:
YES
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of doors is not a positive integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values must be correct. For example, if the number of doors is a string, the program will crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that occurs when the programmer forgets to add or subtract one from a calculation. For example, if the program is supposed to find the sum of the first 100 numbers, but the programmer only adds the first 99 numbers, the result will be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be correct. For example, if the program is supposed to find the maximum value in an array, but the programmer uses the minimum value instead, the result will be incorrect.
5. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when the program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results or crashing.
7. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, but neither thread can do so. This can lead to the program running indefinitely or crashing.
8. **Buffer overflows**. Buffer overflows occur when a program writes data to a buffer that is not large enough to hold the data. This can lead to the program crashing or being corrupted.
9. **Format string vulnerabilities**. Format string vulnerabilities occur when a program uses a format string that is not properly sanitized. This can lead to the program being exploited by an attacker.
10. **SQL injection attacks**. SQL injection attacks occur when an attacker injects malicious code into a SQL query. This can lead to the attacker gaining unauthorized access to the database.

CODEFORCES 1513_C. Add One

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect modulo operation**

When calculating the length of the resulting number, it is important to use the modulo operator correctly. For example, if the resulting number is 1000000000, the modulo operator should be applied as follows:

```
result % 10**9 + 7
```

**2. Off-by-one error**

Another common mistake is to make an off-by-one error when calculating the length of the resulting number. For example, if the resulting number is 1000000000, the length should be 10, not 9.

**3. Incorrect use of the factorial function**

The factorial function can be used to calculate the number of ways to arrange a set of objects. However, it is important to use the factorial function correctly. For example, the factorial of 5 is 120, not 50.

**4. Incorrect use of the binomial coefficient**

The binomial coefficient can be used to calculate the number of ways to choose k objects from a set of n objects. However, it is important to use the binomial coefficient correctly. For example, the binomial coefficient of 5 choose 2 is 10, not 50.

**5. Incorrect use of the fibonacci sequence**

The fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers. The fibonacci sequence can be used to solve a variety of problems. However, it is important to use the fibonacci sequence correctly. For example, the 10th fibonacci number is 55, not 50.

CODEFORCES 188_G. Array Sorting

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong sorting algorithm**

The most common mistake is to use the wrong sorting algorithm. For example, bubble sort is a very inefficient sorting algorithm, and it should not be used for large arrays.

**2. Not using a stable sorting algorithm**

A stable sorting algorithm preserves the original order of equal elements in the array. This is important for some applications, such as when sorting a list of students by their names.

**3. Using a sorting algorithm that does not work on Roco**

Roco is a functional programming language, and some sorting algorithms that work on other languages may not work on Roco. For example, the quicksort algorithm does not work on Roco because it uses mutable state.

**4. Using a sorting algorithm that is not efficient**

Some sorting algorithms are more efficient than others. For example, merge sort is a more efficient sorting algorithm than bubble sort.

**5. Not handling duplicate elements correctly**

Some sorting algorithms handle duplicate elements differently. For example, the quicksort algorithm places duplicate elements together in the sorted array, while the merge sort algorithm places duplicate elements in their original order.

**6. Not handling the case where the array is empty**

Some sorting algorithms do not handle the case where the array is empty correctly. For example, the quicksort algorithm will throw an error if the array is empty.

**7. Not handling the case where the array contains all the same elements**

Some sorting algorithms do not handle the case where the array contains all the same elements correctly. For example, the quicksort algorithm will not sort the array if it contains all the same elements.

CODEFORCES 20_B. Equation

Pain points:
1. The developer may not understand the problem correctly. For example, they may think that the equation is of the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, when it is actually of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.
2. The developer may not know how to solve a quadratic equation.
3. The developer may not know how to print floating-point numbers with a certain number of digits after the decimal point.
4. The developer may not know how to handle the case where the equation has no roots or infinite roots.
5. The developer may make a mistake in their code. For example, they may forget to add a break statement in a loop, or they may mistype a variable name.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. Make sure you understand the problem correctly before you start coding.
2. If you don't know how to solve a quadratic equation, there are plenty of resources available online.
3. Make sure you know how to print floating-point numbers with a certain number of digits after the decimal point.
4. Be careful when handling the case where the equation has no roots or infinite roots.
5. Run your code through a debugger to check for errors.

Title:
CODEFORCES 235_D. Graph Game

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect assumptions**

The first assumption that the developer makes is that a "tree" should have the same number of edges and nodes. This is not true in general. A tree can have more or fewer edges than nodes.

The second assumption that the developer makes is that it is okay to choose any node in "Line A". This is not true in general. The best node to choose in "Line A" is the weight-center of the tree.

**2. Incorrect implementation**

The developer's implementation of the "Divide And Conquer By Node" method is incorrect. The method should not delete the node that is chosen in "Line A". This will cause the tree to become disconnected, which will invalidate the method's correctness.

**3. Incorrect expectation**

The developer's expectation of the total cost of the procedure is incorrect. The total cost of the procedure is not always the same, even if the graph is connected. The total cost depends on the order in which the nodes are chosen in "Line A".

**4. Incorrect error checking**

The developer does not check the input for errors. This could lead to incorrect results if the input is invalid.

**5. Incorrect output formatting**

The developer's output is not formatted correctly. The output should be a single real number, with an absolute or relative error of no more than 10^-6.

CODEFORCES 260_B. Ancient Prophesy

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not specified.** The problem statement does not specify the input format. This could lead to problems if the input is not in the expected format. For example, if the input is a string with spaces, the code may not be able to parse it correctly.
2. **The output format is not specified.** The problem statement does not specify the output format. This could lead to problems if the output is not in the expected format. For example, if the output is a string with spaces, the code may not be able to print it correctly.
3. **The problem statement does not specify the range of valid dates.** The problem statement does not specify the range of valid dates. This could lead to problems if the code tries to parse a date that is not in the valid range. For example, if the code tries to parse a date in the year 2016, it will fail.
4. **The problem statement does not specify the number of days in each month.** The problem statement does not specify the number of days in each month. This could lead to problems if the code tries to parse a date with a day that is not valid for that month. For example, if the code tries to parse a date with a day of 31 in the month of February, it will fail.
5. **The problem statement does not specify the leap year rule.** The problem statement does not specify the leap year rule. This could lead to problems if the code tries to parse a date in a leap year. For example, if the code tries to parse a date with a day of 29 in the month of February in a non-leap year, it will fail.
6. **The problem statement does not specify how to handle ambiguous dates.** The problem statement does not specify how to handle ambiguous dates. This could lead to problems if the code tries to parse a date that could be interpreted in multiple ways. For example, the date "02-29-2015" could be interpreted as either February 29, 2015 or March 1, 2015.
7. **The problem statement does not specify how to handle dates that are not mentioned in the prophecy.** The problem statement does not specify how to handle dates that are not mentioned in the prophecy. This could lead to problems if the code tries to print a date that is not mentioned in the prophecy. For example, if the prophecy does not mention the date "12-31-2015", the code should not print that date.

Title:
CODEFORCES 284_B. Cows and Poker Game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of players who can show their hands.** The most common mistake is to count the number of players who are not folded, rather than the number of players who are not folded and not in.
2. **Using the wrong data type to store the number of players who can show their hands.** The number of players who can show their hands can be very large, so it is important to use a data type that can store large numbers.
3. **Misusing the `count()` function.** The `count()` function counts the number of occurrences of a given element in a list. It is important to make sure that the list is sorted before using the `count()` function, otherwise the results will be incorrect.
4. **Using an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem.** The problem can be solved using a simple algorithm that iterates through the list of players and counts the number of players who are not folded and not in.
5. **Not handling edge cases correctly.** The problem has a few edge cases that need to be handled correctly, such as the case where all of the players are folded or the case where all of the players are in.

Title:
CODEFORCES 331_E2. Deja Vu

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when writing it. For example, you might forget to put a space between two numbers, or you might put the numbers in the wrong order. Make sure to carefully check your input format before submitting your solution.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The input data for this problem is all integers, so you need to make sure that your code is reading the data correctly. For example, if you accidentally read a string as an integer, your code will give the wrong answer.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** This problem is full of off-by-one errors, so it's important to be careful when writing your code. For example, you might forget to add 1 to a variable when you're iterating over a list, or you might subtract 1 from a variable when you're checking a condition.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The logic for this problem is a bit tricky, so it's easy to make a mistake. For example, you might forget to account for the fact that Neo can visit the same shop multiple times.
5. **Memory errors.** This problem can be memory-intensive, so it's important to be careful about how you allocate and free memory. For example, you might accidentally allocate too much memory, or you might forget to free memory that you're no longer using.
6. **Time errors.** This problem can be time-consuming, so it's important to optimize your code as much as possible. For example, you might use a faster algorithm, or you might parallelize your code.

Title:
CODEFORCES 354_E. Lucky Number Representation

Pain points:
```
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer t, which represents the number of test cases. However, if the input contains more than one integer on the first line, or if the first integer is not a positive integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that each line of output should contain exactly six lucky numbers, or the integer -1 if there is no solution. However, if the output contains more than six lucky numbers, or if the output contains any non-lucky digits, the program will produce an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the sum of lucky numbers**. The program must calculate the sum of the lucky numbers in each test case and compare it to the given integer n. If the sum of the lucky numbers is not equal to n, the program must print -1. However, if the sum of the lucky numbers is greater than n, the program will produce an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect handling of negative integers**. The input format specifies that all integers should be positive. However, if the input contains a negative integer, the program will crash.
5. **Incorrect handling of 64-bit integers**. The input format specifies that the input and output should be read and written using the %I64d specifier. However, if the input or output contains a 64-bit integer, the program will crash.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the input format and output format specifications, and to test the program thoroughly with a variety of input values.

CODEFORCES 39_H. Multiplication Table

Pain points:
3 3
 **1. Using the wrong data type for the input or output.** The input is a single integer, so you should use `int` or `long` to store it. The output is a table of numbers, so you should use a two-dimensional array to store it.
2. **Using the wrong formula for multiplication.** The formula for multiplication in a positional notation with radix `k` is `a * b = (a mod k) * (b mod k) + a * (b / k) + b * (a / k)`. Make sure you use this formula correctly.
3. **Not handling edge cases correctly.** What happens if the input is less than 2 or greater than 10? What happens if the output table is empty? Make sure you handle these cases correctly.
4. **Using incorrect indentation.** Make sure your code is properly indented so that it is easy to read.
5. **Using incorrect variable names.** Use descriptive variable names so that your code is easy to understand.
6. **Making logical errors.** Make sure your code is logically correct. Test your code thoroughly to make sure it works correctly.

    for j in range(k - 1):
        table[i][j] = (i + 1) * (j + 1)

for row in table:
    print(*row)
```

2. **Using the wrong formula for multiplication.**

```
k = int(input())

table = [[0 for _ in range(k - 1)] for _ in range(k - 1)]

for i in range(k - 1):
    for j in range(k - 1):
        table[i][j] = (i * j) % k

for row in table:
    print(*row)
```

3. **Not handling edge cases correctly.**

```

Title:
CODEFORCES 425_D. Sereja and Squares

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two integers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if you forget to add a newline character at the end of the output, the program will not be able to produce the correct output.

**3. Incorrect data type**

The input and output data types are not always specified explicitly, so it is easy to make a mistake when casting the data to the correct type. For example, if you try to compare an integer with a floating-point number, the program will not be able to perform the comparison correctly.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when you forget to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to incorrect results, such as counting one square too many or one square too few.

**5. Logical errors**

Logical errors are a type of bug that occurs when the program is not doing what it is supposed to do. For example, if the program is supposed to find all of the squares in a given set of points, but it only finds some of the squares, then there is a logical error in the program.

**6. Runtime errors**

Runtime errors are a type of bug that occurs when the program is running. For example, if the program tries to divide by zero, or if it runs out of memory, then the program will crash.
Test inputs:
**1. Incorrect input format**

```

Title:
CODEFORCES 44_B. Cola

Pain points:
1. The developer may not correctly understand the problem statement. For example, they may think that the bottles of cola are distinguishable, when in fact they are not.
2. The developer may not correctly implement the algorithm for counting the number of ways to buy n liters of cola. For example, they may not account for the fact that the bottles of cola are indistinguishable.
3. The developer may not correctly handle the edge cases. For example, they may not handle the case where n is less than 1 or greater than 10000.
4. The developer may not correctly format the output. For example, they may not print the output as a single integer.
5. The developer may not catch all the errors in their code. For example, they may not catch a divide-by-zero error.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that they understand it correctly. They should also carefully implement the algorithm for counting the number of ways to buy n liters of cola, making sure to account for all the possible edge cases. Finally, the developer should test their code thoroughly to make sure that it does not contain any errors.

Title:
CODEFORCES 470_F. Pairwise Sums

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a single line of space-separated integers. The first number is n (2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 50) â€” the size of the array. The following n numbers are the elements of the array (1 â‰¤ ai â‰¤ 1000). If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect array size.** The array size should be between 2 and 50. If the array size is less than 2 or greater than 50, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will likely crash.
3. **Incorrect array elements.** The array elements should be between 1 and 1000. If any of the array elements are less than 1 or greater than 1000, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will likely crash.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** When computing the sum of two array elements, it is important to make sure that you are not off by one. For example, if you are computing the sum of the first and second elements of the array, you should not add the first element to the second element and then subtract 1. This will result in an incorrect answer.
5. **Indexing errors.** When accessing elements of the array, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct index. For example, if you are trying to access the first element of the array, you should use the index 0, not the index 1. This will result in an incorrect answer.
6. **Memory errors.** If the program does not allocate enough memory to store the array, it will likely crash. This can happen if the array is too large or if the program is running on a system with limited memory.
7. **Floating-point errors.** When computing the sum of two array elements, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct floating-point arithmetic. For example, if you are computing the sum of two numbers that are very close to each other, you may get an incorrect answer if you are using the wrong rounding mode.
8. **Other bugs.** There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. Some common examples include:
    * Using the wrong data type for the array elements
    * Using the wrong algorithm to compute the sums
    * Not handling special cases correctly
    * Making incorrect assumptions about the input data
    * Failing to check for errors
9. **Test cases.** It is important to test your program thoroughly to make sure that it is working correctly. This includes testing with both valid and invalid input data. It is also important to test your program with different data sets to make sure that it is not susceptible to any particular type of input.

Title:
CODEFORCES 494_D. Birthday

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

When working with large numbers, it is important to use the correct data types. In this problem, the input and output are given modulo 109 + 7, so we need to use a data type that can store numbers up to that size. The int data type is only guaranteed to store numbers up to 231 - 1, so it is not sufficient for this problem. We can use the long long data type, which is guaranteed to store numbers up to 263 - 1.

**2. Using incorrect algorithms**

The naive algorithm for solving this problem would be to iterate over all pairs of vertices and calculate the value of f(u, v) for each pair. This would take O(n^2) time, which is too slow for large values of n.

A more efficient algorithm is to use dynamic programming. We can create a table T[i][j] where T[i][j] stores the value of f(i, j) modulo 109 + 7. We can then fill in the table in a bottom-up fashion, starting with the leaves of the tree. For each vertex v, we can calculate the value of T[v][v] as 0. For each edge (u, v), we can calculate the value of T[u][v] as T[u][u] + T[v][v] - 2 * T[u][v]. Once the table is filled in, we can simply iterate over the q queries and output the value of T[u][v] for each query.

**3. Incorrect implementation**

Even if you use the correct data types and algorithms, you can still make mistakes in your implementation. It is important to carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand the problem before you start coding. It is also important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct.

**4. Runtime errors**

When running your code on a large input, you may encounter runtime errors. These errors can be caused by a variety of factors, such as running out of memory or running out of time. To avoid these errors, it is important to optimize your code as much as possible. You can also use a debugger to help you track down the source of the error.

**5. Incorrect output**

Even if your code is correct, you may still get incorrect output if you do not format your output correctly. It is important to make sure that your output is in the correct format, and that it matches the expected output.

  a = list(map(int, input().split()))
  for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
      if a[i] > a[j]:
        return i, j
  return -1, -1

if __name__ == "__main__":

CODEFORCES 846_E. Chemistry in Berland

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is a list of integers, but the developer may accidentally use a list of strings or a list of floats. This will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect index**. The developer may accidentally index the list of materials out of bounds. This will cause the program to crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may implement the solution incorrectly. This will cause the program to output the wrong answer.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may accidentally add or subtract one from a calculation. This will cause the program to output the wrong answer.
5. **Infinite loop**. The developer may implement a loop that never terminates. This will cause the program to run forever.
6. **Memory leak**. The developer may allocate memory that is never freed. This will eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
7. **Security vulnerability**. The developer may implement a program that is vulnerable to attack. This could allow attackers to gain access to the user's system or data.
8. **Incorrect error handling**. The developer may not handle errors correctly. This could cause the program to crash or behave in an unexpected way.
9. **Undocumented features**. The developer may implement features that are not documented. This could cause users to use the program in unintended ways, which could lead to problems.
10. **Poor user interface**. The developer may create a user interface that is difficult to use or understand. This could frustrate users and make them less likely to use the program.

CODEFORCES 868_A. Bark to Unlock

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input contains two lowercase English letters, which should be represented as a string of two characters. However, the developer might accidentally use an integer data type to store the password, which would lead to incorrect results.

**2. Not handling the case where the password is not found**

The problem statement states that Kashtanka can bark several words in a line forming a string containing the password. However, the developer might not handle the case where the password is not found, which would lead to an incorrect answer.

**3. Not handling the case where the password is repeated**

The problem statement states that the words are guaranteed to be distinct. However, the developer might not handle the case where the password is repeated, which would lead to an incorrect answer.

**4. Not handling the case where the password is too long**

The problem statement states that the password is a string of two characters. However, the developer might not handle the case where the password is longer than two characters, which would lead to an incorrect answer.

**5. Not handling the case where the number of words is too small**

The problem statement states that Kashtanka knows n distinct words. However, the developer might not handle the case where the number of words is less than n, which would lead to an incorrect answer.

**6. Not handling the case where the number of words is too large**

The problem statement states that the number of words is at most 100. However, the developer might not handle the case where the number of words is greater than 100, which would lead to an incorrect answer.
Test inputs:
```
# Incorrect data type

pwd = 'aa'
n = 2
words = ['ab', 'ac']

# Not handling the case where the password is not found

pwd = 'aa'

# Not handling the case where the password is repeated

pwd = 'aa'
n = 2
words = ['aa', 'ab']

# Not handling the case where the password is too long

Title:
CODEFORCES 893_D. Credit Card

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect variable type**

The input contains two integers n and d, but the code uses n and d as strings. This will cause a type error.

**2. Incorrect boundary check**

The code checks if n and d are less than or equal to 0, but it should check if they are greater than or equal to 0. This will cause a runtime error.

**3. Incorrect calculation**

The code calculates the minimum number of days Luba has to deposit money by subtracting the number of days when the amount of money on her account is negative from the total number of days. However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not take into account the days when the amount of money on her account is zero.

**4. Incorrect output**

The code prints the minimum number of days Luba has to deposit money, but it does not print a newline character after the output. This will cause the output to be printed on the same line as the input.

**5. Missing error handling**

The code does not handle the case where the amount of money on Luba's account goes greater than d. This will cause a runtime error.

**6. Inefficient algorithm**

The code uses a brute-force algorithm to find the minimum number of days Luba has to deposit money. This algorithm is inefficient because it takes O(n^2) time to run.

**7. Unclear code**

The code is not well-commented and it is difficult to understand what it is doing. This makes it difficult to debug the code and to find errors.

Title:
CODEFORCES 915_A. Garden

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the input/output.** The input and output of this problem are integers, so you should make sure to use the `int` data type when reading and writing the data.
2. **Not handling the edge cases.** The problem statement specifies that `1 â‰¤ n, k â‰¤ 100`, so you should make sure to handle these edge cases.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** The optimal solution to this problem is to find the bucket that can water the largest segment of the garden and then use that bucket to water the garden.
4. **Making a mistake in your implementation.** This is the most common type of bug, and it can be caused by a variety of factors, such as typos, logic errors, and incorrect assumptions.
5. **Not testing your code.** It is important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. This can be done by running your code on a variety of input/output pairs, or by using a unit testing framework.

Title:
CODEFORCES 938_B. Run For Your Prize

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is specified in the problem statement. If the input format is not followed, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce incorrect output.

For example, if the input is "3\n2 3 9" instead of "3\n2 3 9", the program will not be able to parse the input correctly and will produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also specified in the problem statement. If the output format is not followed, the program will not be able to correctly output the answer and will receive a presentation error.

For example, if the output is "8\n" instead of "8", the program will receive a presentation error.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve the problem must be correct in order to produce the correct output. If the algorithm is incorrect, the program will produce incorrect output.

For example, if the algorithm used to solve the problem is to always pick up the first prize, the program will produce incorrect output for any input that contains more than one prize.

**4. Runtime errors**

The program must be able to run to completion in a reasonable amount of time. If the program runs out of time, it will receive a time limit exceeded error.

For example, if the program uses a recursive algorithm to solve the problem, it may run out of time for large inputs.

**5. Memory errors**

The program must not use more memory than is allowed. If the program uses too much memory, it will receive a memory limit exceeded error.

For example, if the program uses a data structure that is too large, it may receive a memory limit exceeded error.
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect input format**

```
3
2 3 9
```

This input is incorrect because it does not follow the specified input format. The input should be a single line containing the number of prizes, followed by a newline, followed by a second line containing the positions of the prizes.

2. **Incorrect output format**

```
8
```

This output is incorrect because it does not follow the specified output format. The output should be a single integer, representing the minimum number of seconds it will take to collect all the prizes.

3. **Incorrect algorithm**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 0
for i in range(1, n):
    ans += abs(a[i] - a[i-1])

print(ans)
```

This program is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the friend can also pick up prizes. The correct algorithm should take into account both the position of the prizes and the positions of the two players.

4. **Runtime errors**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 0
for i in range(1, n):
    ans += abs(a[i] - a[i-1])

print(ans)
```

This program may run into a runtime error if the input is very large. The problem is that the program uses a nested loop to iterate over all of the prizes. This can be very inefficient for large inputs.

5. **Memory errors**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 0
for i in range(1, n):
    ans += abs(a[i] - a[i-1])

print(ans)
```

This program may run into a memory error if the input is very large. The problem is that the program uses a list to store the positions of the prizes. This can be very inefficient for large inputs.

CODEFORCES 963_B. Destruction of a Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not as described in the problem statement. This could be caused by a typo in the code, or by the user entering incorrect input.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not as described in the problem statement. This could be caused by a typo in the code, or by the user not following the instructions correctly.
3. **Incorrect solution.** The code does not correctly solve the problem. This could be caused by a logical error in the code, or by the code not being efficient enough.
4. **Runtime error.** The code does not run correctly and terminates with an error. This could be caused by a number of reasons, such as a divide by zero error, or an out-of-bounds error.
5. **Memory error.** The code runs out of memory and terminates with an error. This could be caused by a large input, or by the code allocating too much memory.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement, and to test the code thoroughly before submitting it.

Title:
CODEFORCES 990_E. Post Lamps

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

When reading the input, it is important to use the correct data type. For example, if the input contains integers, you should read it as integers, not as strings. Otherwise, you may get incorrect results.

**2. Using incorrect logic**

The logic of your solution should be correct. For example, if you are asked to find the minimum cost of a post lamp, you should not return the maximum cost.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are very common. For example, if you are asked to find the length of a string, you should make sure to include the terminating null character in your count.

**4. Using uninitialized variables**

When you declare a variable, you should initialize it to a value. Otherwise, the variable may contain garbage data, which can lead to incorrect results.

**5. Using incorrect indexes**

When you are iterating over an array, you should make sure to use the correct indexes. For example, if you are iterating over an array of size n, you should not use an index greater than n.

**6. Not handling special cases**

When you are writing a program, you should always handle special cases. For example, if the input is empty, you should handle that case.

**7. Using inefficient algorithms**

There are many different algorithms for solving a problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. You should choose the most efficient algorithm for your problem.

**8. Not debugging your code**

Before submitting your code, you should always debug it to make sure that it is correct. You can debug your code by running it on small test cases and checking the results.

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly specified. For example, the input should be in the format `N`, where `N` is the number of sugarcanes. However, the input may contain extra spaces or tabs, or it may not be in the correct format.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be in the format `YES` or `NO`, but the output may contain extra spaces or tabs, or it may not be in the correct format.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the logic may not account for all possible cases.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The logic may be correct, but the implementation may contain off-by-one errors. For example, the logic may correctly calculate the answer, but the implementation may return the wrong answer because it is off by one.
5. **Memory errors**. The program may run out of memory if it is not properly designed. For example, the program may allocate too much memory or it may not free memory that is no longer needed.
6. **Time errors**. The program may run too slowly if it is not properly designed. For example, the program may use a brute-force algorithm that takes a long time to run.
7. **Race conditions**. The program may not be thread-safe if it is not properly designed. For example, the program may access shared data without locking it, which can lead to incorrect results.
8. **Deadlocks**. The program may deadlock if it is not properly designed. For example, the program may have two threads that are waiting for each other to release a lock, which can prevent both threads from ever running.
9. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may contain security vulnerabilities if it is not properly designed. For example, the program may allow a malicious user to gain access to sensitive data or to execute arbitrary code.

HACKEREARTH chandu-and-his-girlfriend-returns

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the merge function.** The merge function should take two sorted arrays as input and output a merged sorted array. However, a developer may accidentally implement the merge function incorrectly, such as by merging the arrays in ascending order instead of descending order. This would result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect use of the in-place merge algorithm.** The in-place merge algorithm is a very efficient way to merge two sorted arrays, but it is important to use it correctly. A developer may accidentally use the in-place merge algorithm on two arrays that are not sorted, which would result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common source of bugs in merge sort. A developer may accidentally increment or decrement an index by one too many or too few, which would result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Memory errors.** A developer may accidentally allocate too much or too little memory for the merged array. This could result in a segmentation fault or a heap overflow.
5. **Time complexity.** The merge sort algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n). A developer may accidentally implement the merge sort algorithm incorrectly, such as by using an inefficient sorting algorithm, which would result in a much slower runtime.

Title:
HACKEREARTH discover-the-monk

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always as expected. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. The developer should make sure to handle all possible input formats correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not always as expected. For example, the output may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be formatted correctly. The developer should make sure to output the correct format.
3. **Incorrect data type**. The input and output data may be of the wrong type. For example, the input may contain strings when it should contain numbers, or the output may contain numbers when it should contain strings. The developer should make sure to convert the data to the correct type before processing it.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when the developer miscounts by one. For example, the developer may iterate through the array one index too low or one index too high. This can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Index out of bounds errors**. Index out of bounds errors occur when the developer tries to access an element of an array that does not exist. This can happen when the developer iterates through the array one index too many. This can lead to a runtime error.
6. **Arithmetic errors**. Arithmetic errors can occur when the developer performs incorrect arithmetic operations. For example, the developer may divide by zero or try to take the square root of a negative number. This can lead to incorrect results or a runtime error.
7. **Logic errors**. Logic errors occur when the developer makes a mistake in the logic of their code. For example, the developer may assume that a certain condition is always true when it is not. This can lead to incorrect results.
8. **Memory errors**. Memory errors can occur when the developer allocates too much or too little memory. This can lead to a runtime error.
9. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or a runtime error.
10. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can lead to a deadlock, which is a situation where no thread can make progress.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or it may contain a string that is not a name. The developer should check the input format and handle errors appropriately.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correct. For example, the output may contain a name that is not in the correct format, or it may not be sorted correctly. The developer should check the output format and handle errors appropriately.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may implement the logic incorrectly. For example, the developer may not correctly sort the names or may not correctly handle ties. The developer should carefully review the logic and ensure that it is correct.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer may not release memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to memory leaks, which can eventually cause the program to crash. The developer should carefully manage memory and release it when it is no longer needed.
5. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer may introduce security vulnerabilities into the program. For example, the developer may allow attackers to inject malicious code into the program or to access sensitive data. The developer should carefully review the code for security vulnerabilities and fix any that are found.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input may contain numbers that are too large to be represented by an integer. In this case, the developer should use a larger data type, such as a long.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may accidentally count one more or one less than the correct number of cheesecakes. This can be avoided by carefully checking the logic of the code.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may use an algorithm that is not optimal. For example, a brute-force algorithm would be very inefficient for this problem. A more efficient algorithm would be to use a greedy approach.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. The developer may make a mistake in implementing the algorithm. This can be avoided by carefully testing the code.
5. **Runtime error**. The developer may make a mistake that causes the code to run into a runtime error. This can be avoided by carefully checking the code for errors.

HACKEREARTH playing-with-substrings

Pain points:
The number of distinct substrings of S such that T is a substring of S is 6
 1. **Off-by-one errors.** When finding the length of a substring, it is easy to accidentally count one character too many or too few. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect use of substring functions.** The substring function can be used to extract a substring from a string. However, it is important to use the function correctly. For example, if you want to extract the substring from index 1 to index 3, you need to use the following syntax: `substring(S, 1, 3)`.
3. **Incorrect use of string comparison operators.** The string comparison operators `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` can be used to compare two strings. However, it is important to use the operators correctly. For example, if you want to check if two strings are equal, you need to use the following syntax: `S == T`.
4. **Incorrect use of logical operators.** The logical operators `&&`, `||`, and `!` can be used to combine two or more boolean expressions. However, it is important to use the operators correctly. For example, if you want to check if two strings are equal or both strings are empty, you need to use the following syntax: `S == T || S == "" || T == "" `.
5. **Incorrect use of control flow statements.** The control flow statements `if`, `else`, and `switch` can be used to control the flow of execution of a program. However, it is important to use the statements correctly. For example, if you want to print the number of distinct substrings of a string, you need to use the following syntax: `if (T is a substring of S) {
    count++;
}`.
6. **Incorrect use of functions.** Functions can be used to group together related code. However, it is important to use functions correctly. For example, if you want to write a function to find the number of distinct substrings of a string, you need to use the following syntax: `function findDistinctSubstrings(S) {
    count = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < S.length; i++) {
        for (j = i + 1; j < S.length; j++) {
            if (S.substring(i, j) == T) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}`.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line of the input should contain the number of days, N. However, if the input format is incorrect, such as if the first line does not contain an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is a string of characters, but the program expects the data to be an integer. If the data type is incorrect, the program will crash.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The program may incorrectly count the number of C's in a coding streak. For example, if the coding streak is "CCCC", the program may incorrectly count it as 4 instead of 5.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The program may use incorrect logic to find the longest coding streak. For example, the program may only consider the coding streaks that occur within a single day, and not the coding streaks that span multiple days.
5. **Memory leak**. The program may not properly release memory that it has allocated. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
6. **Race condition**. The program may not be thread-safe, which can lead to incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.
7. **Security vulnerability**. The program may not be secure, which can allow attackers to access sensitive data or take control of the system.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of `in` operator**. The `in` operator checks if a certain value exists in a sequence. In this problem, we need to check if a certain character exists in a string. To do this, we can use the `str.find()` method.
2. **Incorrect use of `ord()` function**. The `ord()` function returns the ASCII code of a character. In this problem, we need to convert characters to lowercase so that we can compare them correctly. To do this, we can use the `chr()` function.
3. **Incorrect use of `list()` function**. The `list()` function creates a list from a sequence. In this problem, we need to create a list of all the vowels in a string. To do this, we can use the `filter()` function.
4. **Incorrect use of `join()` function**. The `join()` function joins a list of strings into a single string. In this problem, we need to join the vowels in a string with a comma. To do this, we can use the `','.join()` method.
5. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. In this problem, we need to handle the case where there are no vowels in the string. To do this, we can use the `if` statement.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect variable type**

The problem states that the input is a string, but the code below tries to convert it to an integer. This will cause a `TypeError`.

```python
n = int(input())
s = input()
```

**2. Missing `else` statement**

The code below will only print the output for the first test case. The output for the remaining test cases will be ignored.

```python
if s == 'AC':
    print('AC x 1')

```python
print(s)
```

**4. Using an uninitialized variable**

The code below tries to print the value of `c`, but `c` has not been initialized, so this will cause a `NameError`.

```python
print(c)
```

**5. Using the wrong format specifier**

The code below tries to print the value of `c` as a string, but the format specifier `%d` is used, which is for printing an integer. This will cause a `ValueError`.

Title:
ATCODER p02744 Panasonic Programming Contest 2020 - String Equivalence

Pain points:
ba
 bb **1. Using an incorrect sorting algorithm**

The problem asks for the strings in lexicographical order. However, if you use an incorrect sorting algorithm, you may not get the correct answer. For example, if you use bubble sort, you may get the following output for `N = 3`:

```
abc
acb
bac
bca
cab
cba
```

This is incorrect because `abc` is lexicographically smaller than `acb`.

**2. Using an incorrect definition of isomorphism**

The problem defines isomorphism as follows:

```
Strings s and t are said to be isomorphic when the following conditions are satisfied:

* |s| = |t| holds.
* For every pair i, j, one of the following holds:
* s_i = s_j and t_i = t_j.
* s_i \neq s_j and t_i \neq t_j.
```

However, some developers may incorrectly define isomorphism as follows:

```
Strings s and t are said to be isomorphic when the following conditions are satisfied:

* |s| = |t| holds.
* For every pair i, j, s_i = t_j.
```

This is incorrect because it does not take into account the case where `s_i` and `t_j` are equal but not in the same position. For example, the strings `abc` and `cba` are isomorphic under this incorrect definition, but they are not isomorphic under the correct definition.

**3. Using an incorrect definition of normal form**

The problem defines normal form as follows:

```
A string s is said to be in normal form when the following condition is satisfied:

* For every string t that is isomorphic to s, s \leq t holds. Here \leq denotes lexicographic comparison.
```

However, some developers may incorrectly define normal form as follows:

```
A string s is said to be in normal form when the following condition is satisfied:

* s is lexicographically smaller than every string that is isomorphic to it.
```

This is incorrect because it does not take into account the case where two strings are isomorphic and have the same lexicographic order. For example, the strings `abc` and `cba` are both in normal form under this incorrect definition, even though they are isomorphic and have the same lexicographic order.

**4. Not handling the case where N = 1**

The problem does not explicitly state that N can be 1, but it is implied by the fact that the output format includes a single string. However, some developers may not be aware of this and may try to print the empty string for N = 1. This is incorrect because the empty string is not a string of length 1.

**5. Not handling the case where N = 2**

The problem does not explicitly state that N can be 2, but it is implied by the fact that the output format includes two strings. However, some developers may not be aware of this and may try to print only one string for N = 2. This is incorrect because there are two strings of length 2 that are in normal form: `aa` and `ab`.

**6. Not handling the case where N > 2**

The problem does not explicitly state that N can be greater than 2, but it is implied by the fact that the input format includes an integer N. However, some developers may not be aware of this and may try to print the strings in normal form for N = 1 or 2 even if N is greater than 2. This is incorrect because the strings in normal form for N = 1 or 2 are not the same as the strings in normal form for N > 2.
Test inputs:
**1. Using an incorrect sorting algorithm**

```
N = 3
```

**2. Using an incorrect definition of isomorphism**

```
N = 3

**3. Using an incorrect definition of normal form**

N = 3
```

**4. Not handling the case where N = 1**

```
N = 1
```

**5. Not handling the case where N = 2**

```
N = 2
```

**6. Not handling the case where N > 2**

```
N = 4

Title:
ATCODER p02879 AtCoder Beginner Contest 144 - 9x9

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is specified as follows:

```
A B
```

However, a developer may accidentally input the format as follows:

```
A,B
```

This would cause the program to crash.

2. **Incorrect calculation**. The program must calculate the product of A and B and output the result. However, a developer may accidentally calculate the product incorrectly. For example, the following code would output the incorrect result of 100 for the input `2 5`:

```
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
print(a * b)
```

The correct calculation would be:

```
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
print(a * b)
```

3. **Off-by-one error**. The program must check if the product of A and B is between 1 and 20. However, a developer may accidentally check if the product is between 0 and 19. This would cause the program to output the incorrect result of -1 for the input `9 9`:

```
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
if a * b >= 1 and a * b <= 20:
    print(a * b)
else:
    print(-1)
```

The correct check would be:

```
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
if a * b >= 1 and a * b <= 20:
    print(a * b)
else:
    print(-1)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly followed. For example, the input may not have the correct number of elements, or the elements may not be in the correct format.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The developer may make a mistake in the calculation of the number of ways to climb up the stairs. For example, the developer may forget to take into account the fact that the treads of the broken steps are dangerous to set foot on.
3. **Incorrect modulo operation**. The developer may incorrectly perform the modulo operation. For example, the developer may forget to add 1 to the result of the modulo operation.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The developer may incorrectly format the output. For example, the developer may not print the output in the correct format, or the developer may print the output to the wrong file.
5. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the developer may encounter a runtime error, or the developer may introduce a security vulnerability.

ATCODER p03153 KEYENCE Programming Contest 2019 - Connecting Cities

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains integers that can be up to 10^9. If we use the wrong data type, such as int, we will get an overflow error.

**2. Not handling the edge cases**

The input contains two special cases: N = 1 and N = 2. We need to handle these cases separately.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The naive algorithm for this problem is to consider all possible pairs of cities and find the minimum cost of connecting them. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(N^2). We can improve the time complexity by using a more efficient algorithm, such as Kruskal's algorithm.

**4. Not using the right data structures**

We can use a union-find data structure to find the minimum cost of connecting all the cities. This data structure allows us to quickly find the connected components of the graph and find the minimum cost of connecting two components.

**5. Making a mistake in the implementation**

It is easy to make a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm. We need to be careful to avoid off-by-one errors and other common mistakes.

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is given as integers, but some developers may accidentally use the wrong data type, such as strings or floats. This can lead to incorrect results.

**2. Not handling edge cases**

The input data may contain edge cases, such as negative numbers or zeroes. Developers should make sure to handle these cases correctly.

**3. Making a logical error**

The problem statement is fairly straightforward, but it is still possible to make a logical error in the solution. For example, a developer might incorrectly assume that the stock of juice will always increase over time.

**4. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved in O(T) time, but a developer might accidentally use a slower algorithm, such as O(T^2) time.

**5. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. This can be done by running the code on a variety of input data sets.

2. **Incorrect calculation**. The sandglass is turned over at specific times, and the amount of sand in each bulb changes over time. The developer must be careful to calculate the correct amount of sand in each bulb at each time.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may accidentally miss a turn or add an extra turn when calculating the amount of sand in each bulb. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect indexing**. The input data is given in a specific format, and the developer must be careful to index the data correctly. This can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Memory leak**. The developer may accidentally create a memory leak when allocating memory for the data structures used to solve the problem. This can lead to the program crashing or running out of memory.
6. **Timeout**. The developer may not write efficient enough code to solve the problem within the time limit. This can lead to the program being timed out and not being able to finish.
7. **Incorrect output format**. The developer must print the output in the correct format. This can lead to the program being incorrect even if the logic is correct.

ATCODER p03943 AtCoder Beginner Contest 047 - Fighting over Candies

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**. The input format is `a b c`, but the input may contain extra spaces or new lines. For example, `10 30 20 ` or `10 30 20\n`. The developer should check the input format and raise an error if it is not correct.

**2. The input values are not valid**. The input values should be integers between 1 and 100. For example, `a = -1`, `b = 101`, or `c = 100.5`. The developer should check the input values and raise an error if they are not valid.

**3. The output format is not correct**. The output should be either `Yes` or `No`. The developer should check the output format and raise an error if it is not correct.

**4. The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem**. There are many different ways to solve this problem. The developer should choose an algorithm that is efficient and correct.

**5. The developer may make a mistake in their implementation of the algorithm**. The developer should carefully review their code to make sure that there are no errors.

**6. The developer may not test their code sufficiently**. The developer should test their code with a variety of input values to make sure that it is correct.

Title:
AIZU p00035 Is it Convex?

Pain points:
**1. The input data may not be in the correct format.** The input data should be a list of 8 numbers, representing the x and y coordinates of the four points in order. If the data is not in the correct format, the program will not be able to process it correctly and may produce incorrect results.
2. **The points may not be distinct.** The four points in the input data must be distinct, meaning that no two points can have the same x and y coordinates. If two or more points are the same, the program will not be able to determine whether the quadrilateral is convex or not.
3. **The points may not be collinear.** The four points in the input data must not be collinear, meaning that they cannot all lie on the same line. If the points are collinear, the program will not be able to determine whether the quadrilateral is convex or not.
4. **The points may not be in the correct order.** The points in the input data must be given in the order that they are connected by the edges of the quadrilateral. If the points are not given in the correct order, the program will not be able to determine whether the quadrilateral is convex or not.
5. **The program may not be able to correctly determine whether the quadrilateral is convex or not.** There are a number of different ways to determine whether a quadrilateral is convex or not. The program may not be able to correctly implement one of these algorithms, or it may not be able to handle all of the possible cases.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input data and make sure that it is in the correct format. The developer should also make sure that the points are distinct, collinear, and in the correct order. Finally, the developer should carefully implement the algorithm for determining whether the quadrilateral is convex or not.

Title:
AIZU p00167 Bubble Sort

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect comparison of array elements.** When comparing two array elements, it is important to make sure that you are comparing the correct elements. For example, if you are trying to sort an array of numbers, you should not compare the strings that represent the numbers.
2. **Incorrect swapping of array elements.** When swapping two array elements, it is important to make sure that you are swapping the correct elements. For example, if you are trying to sort an array of numbers, you should not swap the strings that represent the numbers.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are many different sorting algorithms, and it is important to use the correct algorithm for the problem you are trying to solve. For example, bubble sort is not a very efficient sorting algorithm, so you should not use it if you are sorting a large dataset.
4. **Not handling edge cases correctly.** When writing a sorting algorithm, it is important to handle edge cases correctly. For example, what should you do if the array is empty? What should you do if the array contains only one element?
5. **Using incorrect data types.** When sorting an array, it is important to use the correct data types for the elements in the array. For example, if you are sorting an array of numbers, you should use the `int` data type, not the `string` data type.
6. **Not using a test suite.** When writing a sorting algorithm, it is important to use a test suite to verify that the algorithm is working correctly. A test suite should include tests for all of the possible edge cases.
7. **Not using a debugger.** When debugging a sorting algorithm, it is helpful to use a debugger to step through the code and identify the source of the bug. A debugger can also be used to track down memory leaks and other problems.

Title:
AIZU p01222 Walk under a Scorching Sun

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is very strict. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash. For example, if the number of buildings and roads are not separated by a space, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The input data are all integers. If the input data are not integers, the program will crash. For example, if the height of a building is 1.5, the program will crash.

**3. Off-by-one error**

When calculating the intersection of a line and a polygon, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, if you are calculating the intersection of a line and a triangle, you might forget to include the first or last point of the triangle.

**4. Floating-point error**

When calculating the length of a line segment, it is easy to make a floating-point error. For example, if you are calculating the length of a line segment with endpoints (0, 0) and (1, 1), you might get a slightly different answer than âˆš2.

**5. Undefined behavior**

The C++ standard allows for undefined behavior in some cases. For example, if you divide a number by zero, the behavior is undefined. If you are not careful, you might accidentally cause undefined behavior in your program.

**6. Memory leak**

If you do not free the memory that you allocate, you will have a memory leak. A memory leak can eventually cause your program to crash.

**7. Race condition**

If multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time, you might get a race condition. A race condition can cause your program to produce incorrect results or to crash.

**8. Deadlock**

If two threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, you might get a deadlock. A deadlock can cause your program to hang indefinitely.

AIZU p01538 Kakezan

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not correct. For example, if the input is "1 2 3", the program will crash because it expects the input to be "1\n2\n3\n".

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not correct. For example, if the output is "1 2 3 a", the program will crash because it expects the output to be "1\n2\n3\n".

**3. Incorrect calculation**

The program may calculate the answer incorrectly. For example, if the input is "1024", the program may output "3" instead of "2". This is because the program does not take into account the fact that 1024 can be split into 10 * 24 or 102 * 4.

**4. Infinite loop**

The program may enter an infinite loop. For example, if the input is "999999", the program may enter an infinite loop because it keeps splitting the number into 99999 and 99.

**5. Memory leak**

The program may leak memory. For example, if the program uses a linked list to store the numbers, it may not free the memory for the nodes that are no longer needed. This can eventually lead to a memory leak.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly specified in the problem statement. A developer may incorrectly assume that the input format is `N M`, where `N` is the number of participants and `M` is the number of winners. This can lead to errors when parsing the input.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the optimal number of rounds**

The optimal number of rounds is given by the formula `ceil(log2(N))`. A developer may incorrectly calculate this formula, leading to an incorrect answer.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the winners in each round**

The winners in each round are determined by finding the `M` smallest values in the list of participants. A developer may incorrectly calculate these values, leading to an incorrect answer.

**4. Incorrect calculation of the total cost of the tournament**

The total cost of the tournament is given by the sum of the costs of each round. A developer may incorrectly calculate these costs, leading to an incorrect answer.

**5. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

AIZU p01974 Pigeonhole principle

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the pigeonhole principle.** The pigeonhole principle states that if you have $n$ pigeons and $n - 1$ pigeonholes, then at least one pigeonhole will contain more than one pigeon. In this problem, we can use the pigeonhole principle to argue that there must exist two numbers in the input list that have a difference of $N - 1$. However, a developer who incorrectly implements the pigeonhole principle may not be able to find these two numbers.
2. **Incorrect handling of duplicate numbers in the input list.** The input list may contain duplicate numbers. If a developer does not handle duplicate numbers correctly, they may not be able to find two numbers in the input list that have a difference of $N - 1$.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the value difference between two numbers.** The value difference between two numbers is the absolute value of one number minus the other number. A developer who incorrectly calculates the value difference may not be able to find two numbers in the input list that have a difference of $N - 1$.
4. **Incorrect output of the two numbers with the desired value difference.** The output of this problem should be two numbers in the input list that have a difference of $N - 1$. A developer who incorrectly outputs the two numbers may not be able to satisfy the problem requirements.
5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These bugs could include incorrect handling of boundary conditions, incorrect use of data structures, and incorrect logic.

Title:
AIZU p02120 Cluster Network

Pain points:
Possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format of the problem is not always strictly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces or newlines, or the numbers may be in a different format than expected. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
* **Incorrect data type:** The data type of the input values may not be what the program expects. For example, the input may contain strings when the program expects numbers, or vice versa. This can also cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic of the program may be incorrect. For example, the program may not correctly check for all possible edge cases, or it may not correctly implement the algorithm. This can also cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
* **Off-by-one errors:** The program may contain off-by-one errors, which are errors where the program increments or decrements a variable by one too many or too few times. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
* **Memory leaks:** The program may leak memory, which means that it does not properly free up memory that it has allocated. This can eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
* **Race conditions:** The program may contain race conditions, which are errors that occur when two or more parts of the program try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output or crash.
* **Deadlocks:** The program may deadlock, which means that two or more parts of the program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can ever finish. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely.
* **Unhandled exceptions:** The program may not handle exceptions properly. For example, the program may not catch errors that are thrown by the operating system or other libraries. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the program thoroughly with a variety of input values. Finally, it is important to use good programming practices, such as using descriptive variable names and comments, and following the style guide for the programming language that you are using.

Title:
AIZU p02260 Selection Sort

Pain points:
**1. Off-by-one errors**

The most common mistake when implementing a sorting algorithm is to make an off-by-one error. This means that you accidentally increment or decrement an index by one too many or too few times. For example, in the selection sort algorithm, you need to iterate through the array from index 0 to `A.length - 1`. If you accidentally iterate from index 0 to `A.length`, you will miss the last element in the array.

**2. Using the wrong variable**

Another common mistake is to use the wrong variable. For example, in the selection sort algorithm, you need to keep track of the smallest element in the array. If you accidentally use the variable `i` to keep track of the smallest element, you will end up swapping the wrong elements.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

It is important to handle edge cases when implementing a sorting algorithm. For example, what happens if the array is empty? What happens if the array contains only one element? You need to make sure that your algorithm works correctly in all cases.

**4. Not using the right data type**

You need to make sure that you are using the right data type for your array. For example, if you are sorting an array of integers, you should use the `int` data type. If you use the `double` data type, you will lose precision and your results will be incorrect.

**5. Not using efficient algorithms**

There are many different sorting algorithms. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. You should choose an algorithm that is efficient for the size of your data set. For example, if you are sorting a small data set, you can use a simple algorithm like bubble sort. If you are sorting a large data set, you should use a more efficient algorithm like merge sort or quick sort.

for i in range(N):
    for j in range(i + 1, N):
        if A[j] < A[i]:
            A[i], A[j] = A[j], A[i]

print(*A)
print(N - 1)
```

**2. Using the wrong variable**

```
N = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(N):
    for j in range(i, N):
        if A[j] < A[i]:
            A[i], A[j] = A[j], A[i]

print(*A)
print(N - 1)
```

**3. Not handling edge cases**

```
N = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

if N == 0:
    print([])
    print(0)
elif N == 1:
    print(A[0])
    print(0)
else:
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(i + 1, N):
            if A[j] < A[i]:
                A[i], A[j] = A[j], A[i]

    print(*A)
    print(N - 1)
```

**4. Not using the right data type**

```
N = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(N):
    for j in range(i + 1, N):
        if A[j] < A[i]:
            A[i], A[j] = A[j], A[i]

print(*A)
print(N - 1)
```

**5. Not using efficient algorithms**

```
N = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(N):
    for j in range(i + 1, N):
        if A[j] < A[i]:
            A[i], A[j] = A[j], A[i]

print(*A)
print(N - 1)
Title:
AIZU p02408 Finding Missing Cards

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not clear.**

The input format is not clear. For example, it is not clear whether the input should be a single line or multiple lines. It is also not clear whether the input should be a list of strings or a list of tuples.

**2. The output format is not clear.**

The output format is also not clear. For example, it is not clear whether the output should be a single line or multiple lines. It is also not clear whether the output should be a list of strings or a list of tuples.

**3. The problem is not well-defined.**

The problem is not well-defined. For example, it is not clear what is meant by "missing cards". It is also not clear what is the expected output.

**4. The problem is too easy.**

The problem is too easy. The solution is straightforward and can be implemented in a few lines of code.

**5. The problem is too hard.**

The problem is too hard. The solution is not straightforward and requires a lot of thinking and effort to implement.
