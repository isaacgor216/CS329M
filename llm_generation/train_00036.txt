Title:
CODECHEF chsparr

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

1. The input format is not specified clearly. Does the input include the number of test cases?
2. The output format is not specified clearly. Does the output include the number of test cases?
3. The constraints are not specified clearly. What are the maximum and minimum values for N, m, x, y, Ai?
4. The example is not clear. What is the output for the first test case? What is the output for the second test case?
5. The problem statement is not clear. What does it mean to "add a new element x + y in the middle of elements x and y"?
6. The solution is not correct. The solution does not take into account the fact that the array A may be empty.
7. The solution is not efficient. The solution uses a nested loop, which is inefficient for large values of N.
8. The solution is not modular. The solution does not use the modulo operator, which is required to get the correct answer.

Here are some possible solutions to these problems and bugs:

1. The input format can be specified as follows:

```
T
N m x y
A1 A2 ... AN
```

where T is the number of test cases, N is the number of elements in the array A in the beginning, m is the amount of minutes, x is the start of the range for finding sum, and y is the end of the range for finding sum. The array A is given in the second line of the input.

2. The output format can be specified as follows:

```
Case #1: <output for the first test case>
Case #2: <output for the second test case>
...
```

3. The constraints can be specified as follows:

```
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^3
1 ≤ m ≤ 30
1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ size of the array A (|A|) after m minutes
```

4. The example can be clarified as follows:

```
The first test case has N = 3, m = 1, x = 1, and y = 5. The array A is given as [1, 6, 9]. After the first minute, the array A will be equal to {1, 7, 6, 15, 9}. The sum of all elements in the array A after the first minute is 38.

The second test case has N = 3, m = 2, x = 6, and y = 7. The array A is given as [1, 6, 9]. After the second minute, the array A will be equal to {1, 8, 7, 13, 6, 21, 15, 24, 9}. The sum of elements between the 6th and 7th positions in the array A after the second minute is 36.
```

5. The problem statement can be clarified as follows:

```
After each minute, Chef iterates over the array A in order from left to right, and takes every two neighbouring pair of elements, say x and y, he adds a new element x + y in the middle of elements x and y. For example, if the initial array A = {1, 6, 9}, after the first minute, the array A will be equal to {1, 7, 6, 15, 9}. Please note that the elements shown in the bold font are the newly added elements during the first minute. As you can observe that 7 = 1 + 6, and 15 = 6 + 9.
```

6. The solution can be corrected as follows:

```
def solve(N, m, x, y):
    # Initialize the array A.
    A = [0] * (N + m)
    # Copy the elements from the original array A to the new array A.
    for i in range(N):
        A[i] = A[i]
    # Iterate over the array A in order from left to right.
    for i in range(N):
        # If the current element is not 0, then add it to the sum.
        if A[i] != 0:
            sum = sum + A[i]
        # Iterate over the next m elements

CODEFORCES 1007_E. Mini Metro

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very clear. It is not clear how to represent the number of stations, hours, and capacity of each train. This can lead to errors in the input code.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the number of trains**

The number of trains needed to stay in the game for t hours is not always equal to the number of stations. For example, if the number of people at each station is less than the capacity of the train, then only one train is needed.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the number of people at each station**

The number of people at each station can change over time. This means that the number of people at a station at the end of an hour may be different from the number of people at the beginning of the hour. This can lead to errors in the calculation of the number of trains needed.

**4. Incorrect calculation of the maximum capacity of each station**

The maximum capacity of each station can change over time. This means that the maximum capacity of a station at the end of an hour may be different from the maximum capacity of the station at the beginning of the hour. This can lead to errors in the calculation of the number of trains needed.

**5. Incorrect calculation of the number of people arriving at each station**

The number of people arriving at each station can change over time. This means that the number of people arriving at a station at the end of an hour may be different from the number of people arriving at the station at the beginning of the hour. This can lead to errors in the calculation of the number of trains needed.

**6. Incorrect calculation of the time when the train arrives at each station**

The time when the train arrives at each station can change over time. This means that the time when the train arrives at a station at the end of an hour may be different from the time when the train arrives at the station at the beginning of the hour. This can lead to errors in the calculation of the number of trains needed.

CODEFORCES 1030_E. Vasya and Good Sequences

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is `n`, followed by a list of `n` integers. However, if the input format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the input is `3 6 7 14`, the program will crash because it expects `n` to be an integer.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer. However, if the output format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the output is `"1 2 3 4"`, the program will crash because it expects a single integer.

**3. Using incorrect data types**

The data types used in this problem are important. For example, if the integers in the input are represented as strings, the program may crash or produce incorrect output. It is important to use the correct data types for each input and output value.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

This problem has a few edge cases that need to be handled. For example, what happens if the input is empty? What happens if all of the integers in the input are the same? The program should be able to handle these edge cases correctly.

**5. Not using efficient algorithms**

The time and space complexity of the algorithm used to solve this problem are important. A naive algorithm may take a long time to run or use a lot of memory. It is important to use an efficient algorithm to solve this problem.

**6. Not debugging the code**

It is important to debug the code to find any errors before submitting it. This can be done by running the code on small test cases and checking the output. It is also helpful to use a debugger to step through the code and see what it is doing.

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input contains two integers n and p, which represent the length of the initial string and the length of the allowed prefix of Latin alphabet. If n or p is greater than 10^5, the program will overflow.

**2. Using incorrect index**

CODEFORCES 1144_B. Parity Alternated Deletions

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains integers that can be up to 10^6. If we use an integer data type to store the elements of the array, we may get an overflow error. To avoid this, we can use a long long data type.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The naive algorithm for solving this problem is to iterate over all the elements of the array and delete all the elements that have the same parity as the last deleted element. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2). We can improve the time complexity by using a greedy algorithm. The greedy algorithm works as follows:

1. We start by deleting the first element of the array.
2. We iterate over the remaining elements of the array. If the current element has the same parity as the last deleted element, we skip it. Otherwise, we delete the current element.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n).

**3. Not handling special cases**

The input may contain special cases, such as an empty array or an array with all elements of the same parity. We need to handle these special cases correctly.

**4. Incorrect output**

We need to make sure that the output is correct. For example, if the input is an empty array, the output should be 0.

**5. Coding errors**

We need to make sure that our code is free of errors. For example, we need to make sure that we are using the correct data types and that we are not making any arithmetic errors.

CODEFORCES 1184_B3. The Doctor Meets Vader (Hard)

Pain points:
The following are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect graph representation:** The input graph may be represented incorrectly, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, if an edge is represented in the wrong direction, then the shortest distance between two nodes may be incorrect.
* **Incorrect spaceship and base data:** The input data for the spaceships and bases may be incorrect, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, if a spaceship's attack strength is less than a base's defense, then the spaceship will not be able to attack the base.
* **Incorrect dependency data:** The input data for the dependencies may be incorrect, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, if a spaceship is dependent on another spaceship that is not operated, then the first spaceship will not be able to be operated.
* **Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm:** The greedy algorithm used to find the maximum total profit may be incorrect, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, if the algorithm does not consider all possible combinations of spaceships and bases, then it may not find the optimal solution.
* **Incorrect output:** The output of the program may be incorrect, which could lead to confusion or errors. For example, if the program prints the wrong answer, then the user may not be able to correctly interpret the results.

By carefully checking the input data and implementing the greedy algorithm correctly, these problems and bugs can be avoided.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1202_C. You Are Given a WASD-string...

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of data structures**. For example, using a list to store the input string instead of a string object. This can lead to errors when trying to access elements of the list out of bounds.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. These are common when working with arrays and indices. For example, if you are trying to access the element at index `i` of an array, but you accidentally write `i + 1`, you will be accessing the element at index `i + 1`, which is outside the bounds of the array.
3. **Incorrect looping conditions**. When looping over an array, it is important to make sure that you are not looping over the same element multiple times. For example, if you are looping over an array of length `n`, you should use the following condition in your loop: `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`.
4. **Incorrect use of mathematical operators**. For example, using the `+` operator to add two strings together will not produce the desired result. Instead, you should use the `+` operator to concatenate two strings together.
5. **Incorrect use of logical operators**. For example, using the `&&` operator to check if two conditions are both true will not work if one of the conditions is false. Instead, you should use the `||` operator to check if either of the conditions is true.
6. **Incorrect use of control flow statements**. For example, using the `if` statement to check if a condition is true will not work if the condition is false. Instead, you should use the `else` statement to execute code if the condition is false.
7. **Incorrect use of functions**. For example, calling a function with the wrong number of arguments will not produce the desired result. Make sure that you are calling functions with the correct number of arguments and that the arguments are of the correct type.
8. **Incorrect use of classes**. For example, creating a class with the wrong methods or properties will not work as expected. Make sure that you are creating classes with the correct methods and properties and that you are using them correctly.
9. **Incorrect use of exceptions**. For example, not catching an exception that is thrown by a function will cause your program to crash. Make sure that you are catching any exceptions that are thrown by your functions and handling them appropriately.
10. **Incorrect use of threading**. For example, not using locks when accessing shared data between threads can lead to data corruption. Make sure that you are using locks whenever you need to access shared data between threads.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1219_H. Function Composition

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect array traversal**

The array can be traversed in the wrong order, which will lead to incorrect results. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3]` and the query is `m = 2, y = 3`, then the function should return `1`, but if the array is traversed in the wrong order, the function will return `0`.

**2. Incorrect calculation of function values**

The function values can be calculated incorrectly, which will also lead to incorrect results. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3]` and the query is `m = 2, y = 3`, then the function value should be `3`, but if the function is calculated incorrectly, the function value will be `2`.

**3. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

The edge cases should be handled correctly, otherwise the function may return incorrect results. For example, if the array is empty and the query is `m = 1, y = 1`, then the function should return `0`, but if the edge cases are not handled correctly, the function may return `1`.

**4. Incorrect use of data structures**

The data structures used to store the array and the function values should be used correctly, otherwise the function may run into memory issues or time out. For example, if the array is very large, using a linked list to store the array may lead to memory issues.

**5. Incorrect use of algorithms**

The algorithms used to solve the problem should be used correctly, otherwise the function may run into time out issues. For example, if the array is very large, using a brute force algorithm to solve the problem may lead to time out.

**6. Incorrect error handling**

The function should handle errors correctly, otherwise the function may crash or produce incorrect results. For example, if the input is invalid, the function should return an error message instead of crashing.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1328_F. Make k Equal

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct.**

The input format of the problem is "n k\na_1, a_2, ..., a_n". However, some developers may mistakenly input the format as "k n\na_1, a_2, ..., a_n". This will cause the program to crash.

**2. The developer does not consider the corner cases.**

The problem states that "1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5". However, some developers may mistakenly assume that "n ≤ k". This will cause the program to crash when n is greater than k.

**3. The developer does not handle the case where all elements are equal.**

The problem states that "You want to obtain at least k equal elements in the array". However, some developers may mistakenly assume that "You want to obtain exactly k equal elements in the array". This will cause the program to output an incorrect answer when all elements are equal.

**4. The developer does not use the most efficient algorithm.**

The problem can be solved in O(n) time. However, some developers may use a slower algorithm, such as O(n^2) time. This will cause the program to run slower than necessary.

**5. The developer does not test the program thoroughly.**

The developer should test the program with a variety of inputs, including inputs that are valid, invalid, and corner cases. This will help to ensure that the program is correct and robust.
Test inputs:

Title:
CODEFORCES 1369_D. TediousLee

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect implementation of the RDB data structure.** This could lead to incorrect results, as the algorithm would be operating on an incorrect representation of the tree.
* **Incorrect implementation of the claw finding algorithm.** This could lead to the algorithm missing some claws, or incorrectly identifying claws that are not actually claws.
* **Incorrect implementation of the coloring algorithm.** This could lead to the algorithm coloring vertices that should not be colored, or not coloring vertices that should be colored.
* **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The input and output specifications are very specific, and any deviation from these specifications could lead to incorrect results.
* **Incorrect use of modular arithmetic.** This could lead to incorrect results, as the algorithm would be operating on numbers that are not properly represented in the modulo.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1391_C. Cyclic Permutations 

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**

When calculating the number of cyclic permutations, you may accidentally use the wrong modulo operator. For example, you might use `% 1000000007` instead of `% 10^9+7`. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**2. Forgetting to account for the edge between the first and last elements**

When building the graph of a permutation, you must remember to add an edge between the first and last elements. This is because a simple cycle must have at least three elements, and the first and last elements must be connected in order to form a cycle.

**3. Not considering all possible permutations**

When calculating the number of cyclic permutations, you must consider all possible permutations of the elements. This means that you cannot simply count the number of permutations that have a simple cycle, you must also count the number of permutations that do not have a simple cycle.

**4. Using an incorrect algorithm**

There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. However, not all of these algorithms are correct. You must make sure that you are using an algorithm that is guaranteed to give the correct answer.

**5. Making a programming error**

Even if you have a correct algorithm, you can still make a programming error when implementing it. This could result in an incorrect answer. It is important to carefully check your code for errors before submitting it.

-1 **Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving problems. Make sure that you understand the problem statement clearly before you start coding.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** Even if you understand the problem statement correctly, you can still make mistakes when implementing the solution. Be careful to avoid typos and other programming errors.
3. **Incorrect test cases.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly. Make sure to test your solution with a variety of different inputs, including inputs that are close to the boundary conditions.
4. **Incorrect debugging.** If your solution does not work correctly, it can be difficult to figure out what is wrong. Make sure to use a systematic approach to debugging, such as the following:
    * **Identify the problem.** What is the specific error that your solution is producing?
    * **Isolate the problem.** Can you find a small piece of code that is causing the error?
    * **Fix the problem.** Make a change to the code that fixes the error.
    * **Re-test your solution.** Make sure that your solution now works correctly.
5. **Failure to submit your solution on time.** This is a common problem that can cost you valuable points. Make sure to submit your solution on time, even if it is not perfect. You can always improve your solution later.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly calculating the minimum number of operations required to obtain the desired string.** For example, a developer might incorrectly assume that the minimum number of operations is equal to the number of characters in the string that are not in the matrix.
* **Incorrectly implementing the shifting operation.** For example, a developer might incorrectly shift the columns by the wrong amount or in the wrong direction.
* **Incorrectly testing the solution.** A developer might test the solution with inputs that are too easy or too difficult. This can lead to the developer incorrectly believing that the solution is correct when it is not.
* **Incorrectly debugging the solution.** A developer might incorrectly identify the problem or incorrectly fix the problem. This can lead to the developer spending a lot of time debugging the solution when it is not necessary.
* **Failure to submit the solution on time.** A developer might forget to submit the solution or submit it too late. This can cost the developer valuable points.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the cost of the path may be less than 0 or greater than 10^9.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not find the minimum cost path or may find a path with a cost greater than the minimum possible cost.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. The implementation of the algorithm may be incorrect. For example, the implementation may contain bugs that cause the algorithm to crash or produce incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect testing**. The test cases used to test the algorithm may be incorrect. For example, the test cases may not test all possible cases or may test cases that are not relevant to the problem.
6. **Incorrect debugging**. The debugging process may be incorrect. For example, the debugger may not be able to find the source of the bug or may find a bug that does not exist.
7. **Incorrect submission**. The submission of the solution may be incorrect. For example, the solution may not be uploaded to the competition website or may be uploaded in an incorrect format.

CODEFORCES 161_B. Discounts

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of integers, but the developer may mistakenly read it as a list of strings. This will lead to incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the minimum price**

The minimum price is calculated as the sum of the prices of all items, minus the discounts for the items in carts that contain stools. The developer may forget to subtract the discounts, or may incorrectly calculate them.

**3. Incorrect distribution of items into carts**

The developer may incorrectly distribute the items into carts, resulting in a suboptimal solution. For example, the developer may put all the stools into one cart, and all the pencils into another cart. This will not result in the minimum total price.

**2. Not considering the case where s is lexicographically smaller than t**

The problem states that the name should be lexicographically strictly larger than the neighbour's son's name t. However, some developers may not consider the case where s is lexicographically smaller than t. In this case, the correct answer is `-1`.

**3. Not considering the case where s and t are equal**

The problem states that the name should be lexicographically strictly larger than the neighbour's son's name t. However, some developers may not consider the case where s and t are equal. In this case, the correct answer is s.

**4. Not considering the case where there is no lexicographically minimum string that is lexicographically strictly larger than t**

The problem states that the name should be lexicographically strictly larger than the neighbour's son's name t and also, lexicographically minimum. However, some developers may not consider the case where there is no lexicographically minimum string that is lexicographically strictly larger than t. In this case, the correct answer is `-1`.

**5. Using a naive algorithm**

The problem can be solved in O(n log n) time using a sorting algorithm. However, some developers may use a naive algorithm that takes O(n^2) time. This would result in a very slow program.

CODEFORCES 228_D. Zigzag

Pain points:
 * The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are:

  1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two integers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
  2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format for this problem is also very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if you forget to add a newline character at the end of each line, the program will not be able to output the correct answer.
  3. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the zigzag function, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, if you forget to add 1 to the index of the first element in the range, the program will calculate the wrong answer.
  4. **Incorrect array indexing.** When accessing elements of the array, it is easy to make a mistake and index out of bounds. For example, if you try to access the element at index n+1, where n is the size of the array, the program will crash.
  5. **Memory leaks.** When allocating memory for the array, it is important to free the memory when you are finished with it. If you do not free the memory, the program will eventually run out of memory and crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 29_E. Quarrel

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is two integers n and m, followed by m lines of two integers each. Each line represents a road between two crossroads. The first integer on each line is the number of the first crossroads, and the second integer is the number of the second crossroads. The crossroads are numbered from 1 to n.

If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce an incorrect output. For example, if the input contains a line with three integers instead of two, the program will not be able to correctly parse the line and will produce an incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect data**

The data for this problem is a set of roads between crossroads. The roads must be represented as two integers, the first of which is the number of the first crossroads and the second of which is the number of the second crossroads. The crossroads are numbered from 1 to n.

If the data contains a road that does not exist, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem and will produce an incorrect output. For example, if the data contains a road between crossroads 1 and 3, when there is no road between those crossroads, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem and will produce an incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect solution**

The solution to this problem is a pair of routes, one for Bob and one for Alex. Each route is a list of crossroads, starting with the crossroads where the person starts and ending with the crossroads where the person ends. The crossroads are numbered from 1 to n.

If the solution is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem and will produce an incorrect output. For example, if the solution contains a road that does not exist, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem and will produce an incorrect output.

**4. Inefficient solution**

The time complexity of the solution to this problem is O(n^2). This is because the algorithm must iterate over all possible pairs of crossroads and check if there is a path between them. This can be a very time-consuming process, especially for large values of n.

**5. Incorrect implementation**

The implementation of the solution to this problem must be correct in order for the program to correctly solve the problem. If the implementation is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem and will produce an incorrect output.

**6. Runtime errors**

The program must be able to run without any runtime errors. If the program contains any runtime errors, it will not be able to correctly solve the problem and will produce an incorrect output.

**7. Memory errors**

The program must be able to run without any memory errors. If the program contains any memory errors, it will not be able to correctly solve the problem and will produce an incorrect output.

CODEFORCES 323_C. Two permutations

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when entering the data. For example, if you forget to put a space between two numbers, the input will be incorrect.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output for this problem should be a list of integers, one per line. Make sure to format your output correctly, or the judge will not be able to grade your solution.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When working with modulo arithmetic, it's easy to make a mistake and get an incorrect answer. Be careful to check your calculations carefully, and make sure that you understand the modulo operator.
4. **Incorrect use of variables.** When solving this problem, you will need to use a number of variables to keep track of the state of the computation. Make sure to initialize these variables correctly, and use them consistently throughout your code.
5. **Uncaught exceptions.** Your code should be able to handle any errors that might occur, such as invalid input or division by zero. Make sure to catch and handle any exceptions that your code might throw, or the judge will not be able to grade your solution.
6. **Inefficient algorithms.** The time complexity of your solution should be O(n + m), where n is the number of elements in the permutations and m is the number of queries. There are a number of ways to optimize your algorithm, such as using binary search or sorting the data.
7. **Memory leaks.** Your code should not leak memory. Make sure to free any memory that you allocate, and close any open files or sockets.
8. **Incorrect logic.** Make sure that your code is correct. This means that it should produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
9. **Unclear code.** Your code should be easy to read and understand. Use clear variable names, and comment your code so that other people can understand what it does.
10. **Bad coding style.** Your code should follow the style guidelines for your programming language. This will make it easier for other people to read and understand your code.

Title:
CODEFORCES 348_A. Mafia

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format:** The input format specifies that the first line should contain an integer n, and the second line should contain n space-separated integers. However, a developer may accidentally read the input incorrectly, for example, by reading the first line as a string instead of an integer. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of rounds:** The minimum number of rounds required is the sum of the maximum number of rounds that each person wants to play. However, a developer may accidentally calculate the minimum number of rounds incorrectly, for example, by forgetting to add one to the maximum number of rounds for each person. This would cause the program to produce incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors:** A developer may accidentally make an off-by-one error when calculating the minimum number of rounds, for example, by forgetting to add one to the number of rounds required for the first person. This would cause the program to produce incorrect output.
4. **Memory errors:** A developer may accidentally allocate too much or too little memory, which could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
5. **Synchronization errors:** A developer may accidentally introduce synchronization errors into the program, which could cause the program to deadlock or produce incorrect output.
6. **Race conditions:** A developer may accidentally introduce race conditions into the program, which could cause the program to produce incorrect output.
7. **Security vulnerabilities:** A developer may accidentally introduce security vulnerabilities into the program, which could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or its data.
8. **Usability issues:** A developer may accidentally make the program difficult to use, for example, by using confusing or inconsistent error messages. This could cause users to give up on using the program or to make incorrect use of the program.
9. **Performance issues:** A developer may accidentally make the program inefficient, for example, by using inefficient algorithms or data structures. This could cause the program to run slowly or to use too much memory.
10. **Maintainability issues:** A developer may accidentally make the program difficult to maintain, for example, by using poor coding practices or by not following a consistent coding style. This could make it difficult to fix bugs or to add new features to the program.

CODEFORCES 392_D. Three Arrays

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem states that each array has `n` elements, but the input format does not specify the size of the arrays. This could lead to a bug where the developer tries to access an element of an array that is out of bounds.
2. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** The problem requires the developer to find the minimum possible sum of `u + v + w`, but the naive approach of iterating over all possible values of `u`, `v`, and `w` and finding the minimum sum is not efficient. A more efficient approach would be to use a greedy algorithm.
3. **Incorrect handling of errors.** The problem does not specify what to do if the input is invalid. This could lead to a bug where the developer tries to process invalid input, which could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect output formatting.** The problem states that the output should be a single integer, but the example output contains multiple integers. This could lead to a bug where the developer outputs the wrong answer.
5. **Incorrect variable naming.** The problem uses the variable names `a`, `b`, and `c` to refer to the three arrays. This could lead to confusion if the developer is not familiar with the problem statement.
6. **Incorrect comments.** The problem does not include any comments, which could make it difficult for the developer to understand the code.
7. **Inefficient code.** The code could be made more efficient by using a more efficient algorithm or by using a more efficient data structure.
8. **Unnecessary code.** The code could be simplified by removing unnecessary code.
9. **Untested code.** The code has not been tested, which could lead to bugs that are not caught until the code is deployed in production.
10. **Insecure code.** The code does not take into account security issues, which could lead to vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

Title:
CODEFORCES 464_D. World of Darkraft - 2

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is two integers, n and k. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

**2. Incorrect calculation of expected value**

The expected value of a random variable is the sum of the product of each possible outcome and its probability. In this problem, the possible outcomes are the number of coins earned after each monster is defeated. The probability of each outcome is the probability that a new item is of a certain level.

To calculate the expected value, we need to sum the product of each possible outcome and its probability. However, if the calculation is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

**3. Floating-point error**

Floating-point numbers are not exact representations of real numbers. This means that when a floating-point number is rounded to a certain number of digits, it may not be exactly equal to the real number. This can lead to errors in the calculation of the expected value.

To avoid floating-point error, it is important to use the correct rounding mode and to make sure that the numbers are not rounded too much.

**4. Incorrect use of functions**

The problem statement provides a number of functions that can be used to solve the problem. If these functions are used incorrectly, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

For example, the `rand()` function can be used to generate a random number. However, if this function is used incorrectly, the program may generate a number that is not in the correct range.

**5. Incorrect use of data structures**

The problem statement may require the use of data structures such as arrays, lists, or sets. If these data structures are used incorrectly, the program may not be able to correctly store or access the data.

For example, if an array is used to store the number of coins earned after each monster is defeated, the program may not be able to correctly access the data if the array is not initialized correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 630_A. Again Twenty Five!

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. For example, 5 % 10 returns 5, because 5 divided by 10 leaves a remainder of 5. However, if you use the modulo operator on a very large number, you may get an incorrect result. For example, 2 ** 64 % 10 returns 7, even though the last two digits of 2 ** 64 are 64. This is because the modulo operator only returns the remainder of the division, and the remainder of 2 ** 64 divided by 10 is not the same as the last two digits of 2 ** 64.
2. **Incorrect use of the exponentiation operator.** The exponentiation operator (**) raises a number to a power. For example, 5 ** 2 returns 25. However, if you use the exponentiation operator on a very large number, you may get an incorrect result. For example, 2 ** 1000000000000000000 % 10 returns 7, even though the last two digits of 2 ** 1000000000000000000 are 64. This is because the exponentiation operator only returns the last two digits of the number, and the last two digits of 2 ** 1000000000000000000 are not the same as the last two digits of 2 ** 1000000000000000000 % 10.
3. **Incorrect use of the factorial function.** The factorial function (!) returns the product of all the numbers from 1 to a given number. For example, 5! returns 120. However, if you use the factorial function on a very large number, you may get an incorrect result. For example, 1000000000! returns -1, even though the last two digits of 1000000000! are 00. This is because the factorial function only returns the last two digits of the number, and the last two digits of 1000000000! are not the same as the last two digits of 1000000000! % 100.

2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input may not be correct. For example, the input may contain strings instead of numbers. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating over a list or array, it is important to make sure that the index is incremented correctly. An off-by-one error can cause the program to skip or repeat an element, which can lead to incorrect output.
4. **Logic errors**. The logic of the program may be incorrect. For example, the program may not correctly check for all possible cases. This can lead to incorrect output.
5. **Memory leaks**. The program may not release memory that it is no longer using. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions**. When multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is important to make sure that the data is accessed in a consistent manner. A race condition can occur when two threads try to access the same data at the same time, which can lead to incorrect output.
7. **Deadlocks**. When multiple threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, it is possible for a deadlock to occur. A deadlock occurs when each thread is waiting for the other thread to release the lock, and neither thread can proceed.
8. **Buffer overflows**. When a program writes data to a buffer that is not large enough, it can cause a buffer overflow. A buffer overflow can overwrite data on the stack, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.
9. **Format string vulnerabilities**. When a program uses a format string to print data, it is possible for an attacker to inject malicious code into the program. This can lead to security vulnerabilities.
10. **SQL injection vulnerabilities**. When a program uses a SQL query to retrieve data from a database, it is possible for an attacker to inject malicious code into the query. This can lead to security vulnerabilities.

 **1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data contains integers that can be as large as 10^9. If you use an integer data type that is too small, you will get overflow errors. For example, if you use `int` in C++, you will get an overflow error for inputs like `1000000000`.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks you to find the sum of medians of a set of numbers. The naive algorithm is to sort the numbers and then find the medians. However, this algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n). There are more efficient algorithms that have a time complexity of O(n).

**3. Not handling corner cases**

The problem statement mentions some corner cases, such as the case where the set is empty. You need to make sure that your code handles these corner cases correctly.

**4. Using incorrect code**

There are many ways to write incorrect code. For example, you might use the wrong data type, use the wrong algorithm, or not handle corner cases correctly. It is important to carefully review your code before submitting it to make sure that it is correct.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it to make sure that it is correct. You can test your code by using a variety of test cases, including both simple and complex test cases.

CODEFORCES 909_D. Colorful Points

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the `in` operator.** The `in` operator checks if a value is present in a sequence. For example, `'a' in 'abc'` would return `True`. However, if you try to use the `in` operator on a sequence that doesn't exist, you will get a `TypeError`. For example, `'a' in [1, 2, 3]` would return `False`.
2. **Incorrect use of the `del` operator.** The `del` operator deletes a value from a sequence. For example, `del [1, 2, 3][1]` would delete the second element of the list, which is `2`. However, if you try to use the `del` operator on a sequence that doesn't exist, you will get a `TypeError`. For example, `del [1, 2, 3][4]` would return `TypeError`.
3. **Incorrect use of the `range()` function.** The `range()` function returns a sequence of numbers from a starting point to an ending point. For example, `range(1, 10)` would return the numbers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`. However, if you try to use the `range()` function with a negative starting point, you will get a `ValueError`. For example, `range(-1, 10)` would return `TypeError`.
4. **Incorrect use of the `len()` function.** The `len()` function returns the length of a sequence. For example, `len([1, 2, 3])` would return `3`. However, if you try to use the `len()` function on a sequence that doesn't exist, you will get a `TypeError`. For example, `len([1, 2, 3])` would return `TypeError`.
5. **Incorrect use of the `isalpha()` function.** The `isalpha()` function checks if a string is alphabetic. For example, `'a'.isalpha()` would return `True`. However, if you try to use the `isalpha()` function on a string that contains non-alphabetic characters, you will get a `False`. For example, `'123'.isalpha()` would return `False`.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

* **Use the `type()` function to check if a value is a sequence.** For example, `type('abc')` would return `str`, which is a sequence.
* **Use the `len()` function to check if a sequence is empty.** For example, `len('')` would return `0`, which means the sequence is empty.
* **Use the `in` operator to check if a value is present in a sequence.** For example, `'a' in 'abc'` would return `True`.
* **Use the `del` operator to delete a value from a sequence.** For example, `del [1, 2, 3][1]` would delete the second element of the list, which is `2`.
* **Use the `range()` function to return a sequence of numbers.** For example, `range(1, 10)` would return the numbers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`.
* **Use the `isalpha()` function to check if a string is alphabetic.** For example, `'a'.isalpha()` would return `True`.

CODEFORCES 931_A. Friends Meeting

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer a, and the second line should contain a single integer b. However, if the input contains more than one integer on a line, or if the input contains a non-integer value, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the output should be a single integer, representing the minimum total tiredness the friends should gain if they meet in the same point. However, if the output contains more than one integer, or if the output contains a non-integer value, the program will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum total tiredness**. The minimum total tiredness is the sum of the tiredness of the first friend and the tiredness of the second friend. However, if the program incorrectly calculates the tiredness of either friend, or if the program incorrectly calculates the sum of the two tiredness values, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. When calculating the minimum total tiredness, it is important to make sure that the friends meet in the same point. This means that the sum of the two friends' tiredness values must be equal to the absolute value of the difference between their initial positions. However, if the program makes an off-by-one error in its calculations, the friends may not meet in the same point, and the output will be incorrect.
5. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:
    * Using the wrong data type to store the friends' positions or tiredness values.
    * Using an incorrect algorithm to calculate the minimum total tiredness.
    * Making a logical error in the program's logic.
    * Failing to handle errors correctly.

By carefully avoiding these potential problems, developers can write a correct and efficient solution to this problem.

CODEFORCES 985_A. Chess Placing

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format specifies that the first line of the input should contain one integer n, and the second line should contain <image> integer numbers pi. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash or produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format specifies that the program should print one integer, which is the minimum number of moves required to place all the pieces in the cells of the same color. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly produce output and will likely crash or produce incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of moves**

The minimum number of moves required to place all the pieces in the cells of the same color can be calculated by finding the maximum distance between any two pieces. However, if the program does not correctly calculate this distance, it will likely produce incorrect output.

**4. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

The input may contain edge cases, such as a chessboard of size 1 or a chessboard with no pieces on it. The program must be able to correctly handle these edge cases and produce the correct output.

**5. Incorrect use of data structures**

The program must use data structures that are appropriate for the problem being solved. For example, if the program is using a hash table to store the positions of the pieces, it must make sure that the hash table is large enough to store all of the pieces. If the hash table is not large enough, the program will likely crash or produce incorrect output.

Title:
HACKEREARTH bobs-journey-5

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type to store the cities.** If the cities are stored as strings, then it is possible that two cities with the same first letter will be considered to be the same city. For example, if the cities are "bhopal" and "delhi", then they will both be stored as the string "b" and Bob will not be able to remember them distinctly.
2. Not using a set to store the cities. A set is a data structure that only stores unique elements. This means that if two cities are added to a set, then only one of them will be stored in the set. This is important for this problem because it ensures that Bob will not be able to remember two cities with the same first letter.
3. Not using a loop to iterate over the cities. If the cities are not iterated over, then Bob will not be able to remember all of them.
4. Not checking if the set is full after each city is added. If the set is full, then Bob will not be able to remember any more cities.
5. Not printing the correct output. The output should be "YES" if Bob is able to remember all of the cities and "NO" if he is not able to remember all of them.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use an integer data type to store the cities. This will ensure that two cities with the same first letter will be considered to be different cities.
* Use a set to store the cities. This will ensure that only unique cities are stored in the set.
* Use a loop to iterate over the cities. This will ensure that Bob will be able to remember all of the cities.
* Check if the set is full after each city is added. This will ensure that Bob will not be able to remember any more cities if the set is full.
* Print the correct output. The output should be "YES" if Bob is able to remember all of the cities and "NO" if he is not able to remember all of them.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly using the merge function.** The merge function takes two strings as input and returns a new string that is a combination of the two input strings. However, some developers may incorrectly use the merge function by passing in three or more strings. This will result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrectly using the shuffle function.** The shuffle function takes a string as input and returns a new string that is a permutation of the input string. However, some developers may incorrectly use the shuffle function by passing in a string that is not a permutation of the input string. This will result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrectly using the reverse function.** The reverse function takes a string as input and returns a new string that is the reverse of the input string. However, some developers may incorrectly use the reverse function by passing in a string that is not a palindrome. This will result in an incorrect answer.

Title:
HACKEREARTH trailing-zero-problem-1

Pain points:
7 **1. Using a naive approach**

A naive approach to solve this problem would be to calculate the factorial of `n` and then count the number of trailing zeros. This approach is **exponential** in time complexity, and so it will not be able to solve large instances of the problem.

**2. Using a divide and conquer approach**

A divide and conquer approach to solve this problem would be to first divide `n` by 5, and then recursively calculate the length of the factorial of the resulting number. The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is equal to the number of trailing zeros in `(n / 5)!` plus the number of times 5 divides `n`. This approach is **O(log n)** in time complexity, and so it will be able to solve large instances of the problem.

**3. Using a dynamic programming approach**

A dynamic programming approach to solve this problem would be to create a table `dp[i]`, where `dp[i]` represents the length of the factorial of `i`. We can then fill in the table in a bottom-up fashion, starting with `dp[0] = 0`. For each `i > 0`, we can calculate `dp[i]` as follows:

```
dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (i // 5)
```

This approach is **O(n)** in time complexity, and so it will be able to solve large instances of the problem.

**4. Using a bit manipulation approach**

A bit manipulation approach to solve this problem would be to use the fact that the number of trailing zeros in a number is equal to the number of times the number 5 divides the number. We can use this fact to calculate the number of trailing zeros in `n!` by counting the number of times the number 5 divides `n`. This approach is **O(log n)** in time complexity, and so it will be able to solve large instances of the problem.

**5. Using a mathematical approach**

A mathematical approach to solve this problem would be to use the following formula:

```
length(n!) = n * (log n - log 5) + 1
```

This formula is derived from the fact that the number of trailing zeros in a number is equal to the number of times the number 5 divides the number. This approach is **O(1)** in time complexity, and so it will be able to solve large instances of the problem.

**6. Using a combination of approaches**

In some cases, it may be possible to use a combination of approaches to solve this problem. For example, we could use a divide and conquer approach to calculate the number of trailing zeros in `(n / 5)!`, and then use a mathematical approach to calculate the number of trailing zeros in `n!`. This approach would be **O(log n)** in time complexity, and so it would be able to solve large instances of the problem.

Title:
ATCODER p02574 AtCoder Beginner Contest 177 - Coprime

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong algorithm**

The most common mistake is to use the wrong algorithm to solve the problem. For example, you might try to use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of all the numbers in the list, but this will not work if any of the numbers are negative.

**2. Not handling edge cases**

Another common mistake is to not handle edge cases. For example, what if the list is empty? Or what if all the numbers in the list are the same? You need to make sure that your code handles these cases correctly.

**3. Using incorrect data types**

It is important to use the correct data types when solving this problem. For example, if you are using Python, you should use the `int` data type for all the numbers in the list. Using the wrong data type could lead to incorrect results.

**4. Making a mistake in your implementation**

Even if you use the correct algorithm and handle all the edge cases, you could still make a mistake in your implementation. This could be anything from a simple typo to a more complex error. It is important to carefully review your code before you submit it to make sure that it is correct.

**5. Not testing your code**

Finally, it is important to test your code before you submit it. This will help you to catch any bugs that you might have missed. You can test your code by using a variety of test cases, including both positive and negative cases.

ATCODER p02705 AtCoder Beginner Contest 163 - Circle Pond

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect calculation of pi**. The most common mistake is to use the wrong value for pi. The correct value is `3.141592653589793`.
2. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers**. Floating-point numbers are not exact, and rounding errors can cause your output to be incorrect. To avoid this, you should use the `round()` function to round your output to the desired precision.
3. **Incorrect use of the `pow()` function**. The `pow()` function raises a number to a power. In this problem, you need to raise 2 to the power of `R`, which you can do with the following code:
```
circumference = 2 * math.pi * R
```
4. **Incorrect use of the `math.pi` constant**. The `math.pi` constant is a built-in Python function that returns the value of pi. You can use it in your code like this:
```
circumference = 2 * math.pi * R
```
5. **Incorrect use of the `print()` function**. The `print()` function prints a value to the console. In this problem, you need to print the circumference of the circle. You can do this with the following code:

Title:
ATCODER p02834 AtCoder Beginner Contest 148 - Playing Tag on Tree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the game rules**

The game rules are not clearly defined, so it is possible to implement them incorrectly. For example, one possible mistake is to assume that Takahashi and Aoki always move to adjacent vertices. Another mistake is to assume that Takahashi and Aoki always move to the same vertex.

**2. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

The input may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers that are too large. It is important to handle these edge cases correctly, or the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect use of data structures**

The problem requires the use of a data structure to represent the tree. If the data structure is not implemented correctly, the program may not be able to solve the problem efficiently.

**4. Incorrect use of algorithms**

The problem can be solved using a variety of algorithms. However, some algorithms are more efficient than others. It is important to choose the right algorithm for the problem, or the program may not be able to solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time.

**5. Incorrect error handling**

The program should be able to handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input is invalid, the program should print an error message and exit.

**6. Incorrect testing**

It is important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. This can be done by writing unit tests, integration tests, and system tests.

**7. Incorrect documentation**

The program should be well-documented so that other developers can understand how it works. The documentation should include a description of the problem, the solution, and the implementation.

**8. Incorrect deployment**

Once the program is complete, it must be deployed to a production environment. This process involves copying the program to the production server, configuring the server, and starting the program.

ATCODER p02971 AtCoder Beginner Contest 134 - Exception Handling

Pain points:
1. **Index out of bound**. The input size `N` may be greater than `200000`, which is the maximum size of an array in Python. To avoid this, we can use a list instead of an array.
2. **Value overflow**. The input values `A_i` may be greater than `200000`, which is the maximum value that can be represented by an integer in Python. To avoid this, we can use a long integer type.
3. **Incorrect comparison**. The problem asks us to find the maximum value among the `N-1` elements other than `A_i`. However, we may accidentally compare `A_i` with itself, which will always result in a tie. To avoid this, we can use a `set` to store all the elements other than `A_i`.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The problem asks us to print `N` lines. However, we may accidentally print only `N-1` lines or more than `N` lines. To avoid this, we can use a `for` loop to iterate over the `N` elements.

Title:
ATCODER p03107 AtCoder Beginner Contest 120 - Unification

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect array initialization**

When initializing an array, it is important to make sure that the array is large enough to hold all of the elements that you will be storing in it. If the array is not large enough, then you may end up with an out-of-bounds error.

For example, the following code will cause an out-of-bounds error:

```
int arr[10];
arr[11] = 10; // Error!
```

To avoid this problem, make sure to initialize the array with a size that is large enough to hold all of the elements that you will be storing in it.

**2. Using the wrong data type**

When storing data in an array, it is important to use the correct data type. If you use the wrong data type, then you may end up with incorrect results.

For example, the following code will cause incorrect results:

```
int arr[10];
arr[0] = "hello"; // Error!
```

The variable `arr[0]` is of type `int`, but the string "hello" is of type `char[]`. This means that when you store the string "hello" in the array, it will be truncated to the first character.

To avoid this problem, make sure to use the correct data type for each element in the array.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when you accidentally miscount by one. This can happen when you are iterating over an array, adding or removing elements from an array, or calculating the size of an array.

For example, the following code will cause an off-by-one error:

```
int arr[10];
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  // Do something with arr[i]
}
```

The problem with this code is that the loop iterates over the array from 0 to arr.length - 1. This means that the last element in the array, arr[9], will not be processed.

To avoid this problem, make sure to check the bounds of your array before accessing or modifying any elements.

**4. Using uninitialized variables**

When using a variable, it is important to make sure that it has been initialized before you use it. If you use a variable that has not been initialized, then you may end up with an unexpected value.

For example, the following code will cause an error:

```
int x;
System.out.println(x); // Error!
```

The variable `x` has not been initialized, so it does not have a value. This means that when you try to print the value of `x`, you will get an error.

To avoid this problem, make sure to initialize all of your variables before you use them.

**5. Forgetting to free memory**

When you allocate memory for an object, it is important to free that memory when you are finished with it. If you do not free the memory, then it will continue to occupy memory on your computer, even though you are no longer using it.

For example, the following code will cause a memory leak:

```
int[] arr = new int[10];
// Do something with arr
```

The variable `arr` is an array of 10 integers. When the code finishes executing, the array will still be in memory, even though it is no longer being used. This is a memory leak.

To avoid this problem, make sure to free any memory that you allocate when you are finished with it.

Title:
ATCODER p03407 AtCoder Beginner Contest 091 - Two Coins

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is specified as follows:

```
A B C
```

However, a developer may accidentally input the values in a different order, such as:

```
C A B
```

This would cause the program to crash.

2. **Incorrect data type**. The input values are specified as integers. However, a developer may accidentally input a value that is not an integer, such as a string. This would cause the program to crash.

3. **Incorrect calculation**. The program must calculate whether Takahashi can buy the toy. To do this, the program must subtract the cost of the toy from the total value of Takahashi's coins. However, a developer may accidentally make a mistake in the calculation, such as subtracting the cost of the toy from the value of one coin instead of the total value of Takahashi's coins. This would cause the program to output an incorrect answer.

4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is specified as follows:

```
Yes
```

or

```
No
```

However, a developer may accidentally output the values in a different format, such as:

```
y
```

or

```
n
```

This would cause the program to output an incorrect answer.

5. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other potential bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:

* Using the wrong variable names
* Forgetting to initialize variables
* Using incorrect operators
* Making logic errors

By carefully following the instructions and avoiding these common mistakes, developers can write a program that correctly solves this problem.

Title:
ATCODER p03570 CODE FESTIVAL 2017 qual C - Yet Another Palindrome Partitioning

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type:** The input string `s` can have a length of up to `2 * 10^5`, so it's important to use a data type that can store such a large number of characters. Using a data type that is too small, such as a `char` array, will cause the program to overflow and crash.
2. **Not handling invalid input:** The input string `s` can contain any lowercase English letter, so it's important to check for invalid characters before attempting to process the string. If an invalid character is found, the program should exit with an error.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm:** The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming algorithm. However, it's important to choose the correct algorithm for the problem. Using an incorrect algorithm will result in a incorrect solution or a time complexity that is too high.
4. **Not handling edge cases:** The problem has a few edge cases that need to be handled correctly. For example, if the input string is empty, the program should return `0`.
5. **Not testing the code:** It's important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly. This includes testing for all possible input cases, as well as edge cases. By testing the code thoroughly, you can catch bugs early and avoid having to fix them later.
Test inputs:

ATCODER p03725 AtCoder Grand Contest 014 - Closed Rooms

Pain points:
**Possible Problems:**

* The input format is not clear. Is the input a 2D array? Or is it a list of strings?
* The output format is not clear. Is it the number of casts? Or is it the shortest path?
* The problem statement is not clear. What does it mean by "Takahashi will use his magic to get out of the building"? What does it mean by "move to an adjacent room at most K times"? What does it mean by "unlock at most K locked rooms"?
* The constraints are not clear. What does it mean by "H×W rooms"? What does it mean by "Each A_{i,j} is `#` , `.` or `S`"?
* The example input is not clear. What does it mean by "3 3 3"? What does it mean by "S###"?
* The example output is not clear. What does it mean by "1"?

**Possible Bugs:**

* The developer may not correctly parse the input.
* The developer may not correctly implement the algorithm to find the shortest path.
* The developer may not correctly implement the algorithm to unlock the locked rooms.
* The developer may not correctly output the answer.

Title:
ATCODER p03889 CODE FESTIVAL 2016 Relay (Parallel) - Mirror String

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of `if` statements.** One common mistake is to use an `if` statement to check whether a string is a mirror string, but not to handle the case where the string is not a mirror string. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
def is_mirror_string(s):
  if s == s[::-1]:
    return True
  else:
    return False

s = input()
if is_mirror_string(s):
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")
```

This code will print `Yes` for any string that is a palindrome, even if it is not a mirror string. To fix this, we need to add an else clause to the `if` statement to handle the case where the string is not a mirror string.

```
def is_mirror_string(s):
  if s == s[::-1]:
    return True
  else:
    return False

s = input()
if is_mirror_string(s):
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")
```

2. **Incorrect use of `for` loops.** Another common mistake is to use a `for` loop to iterate over the characters in a string, but not to handle the case where the string is empty. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
def is_mirror_string(s):
  for i in range(len(s)):
    if s[i] != s[len(s) - 1 - i]:
      return False
  return True

s = input()
if is_mirror_string(s):
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")
```

This code will print `No` for any string that is not a palindrome, even if it is a mirror string. To fix this, we need to add an `else` clause to the `for` loop to handle the case where the string is empty.

```
def is_mirror_string(s):
  for i in range(len(s)):
    if s[i] != s[len(s) - 1 - i]:
      return False
  return True

s = input()
if is_mirror_string(s):
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")
```

3. **Incorrect use of `in` operator.** The `in` operator is used to check whether a value is contained in a sequence. For example, the following code will check whether the letter `b` is contained in the string `s`:

```
if 'b' in s:
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")
```

However, the `in` operator can also be used to check whether a substring is contained in a string. For example, the following code will check whether the substring `"pq"` is contained in the string `s`:

```
if 'pq' in s:
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")
```

One common mistake is to use the `in` operator incorrectly. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
def is_mirror_string(s):
  if 'pq' in s:
    return True
  else:
    return False

s = input()
if is_mirror_string(s):
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")
```

This code will print `Yes` for any string that contains the substring `"pq"`, even if the string is not a mirror string. To fix this, we need to use the `in` operator to check whether the entire string is a mirror string.

```
def is_mirror_string(s):
  if s == s[::-1]:
    return True
  else:
    return False

s = input()
if is_mirror_string(s):
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")
```

4. **Incorrect use of `ord` function.** The `ord` function is used to convert a character to its ASCII code. For example, the following code will print the ASCII code for the letter `a`:

```
print(ord('a'))
```

However, the `ord` function can also be used to convert a substring to its ASCII code. For example, the following

Title:
ATCODER p04048 AtCoder Grand Contest 001 - Mysterious Light

Pain points:
**1. Off-by-one errors**

The most common bug when solving this problem is an off-by-one error. This can happen when you are calculating the length of the ray's trajectory, or when you are counting the number of reflections. To avoid this, make sure to double-check your calculations and make sure that you are not missing any steps.

**2. Incorrect assumptions**

Another common bug is making an incorrect assumption about the problem. For example, you might assume that the ray of light will always travel in a straight line, or that it will always be reflected by the mirrors. However, this is not always the case. Make sure to read the problem carefully and understand all of the constraints before you start coding.

**3. Using the wrong data type**

When working with large numbers, it is important to use the correct data type. For example, if you are working with numbers that are greater than 2^31-1, you should use a 64-bit integer instead of a 32-bit integer. Otherwise, you may encounter overflow errors.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

When solving a problem, it is important to handle all of the edge cases. For example, what happens if N is equal to 2? What happens if X is equal to 1? Make sure to test your code with all of the possible edge cases to ensure that it works correctly.

**5. Using inefficient algorithms**

When solving a problem, it is important to use an efficient algorithm. For example, you could use the following algorithm to calculate the total length of the ray's trajectory:

```
def calculate_trajectory_length(n, x):
  # Initialize the total length.
  total_length = 0

  # Iterate over the number of reflections.
  for i in range(n):
    # Calculate the length of the current reflection.
    reflection_length = 2 * n - 2 * i - x

    # Add the length of the current reflection to the total length.
    total_length += reflection_length

  # Return the total length.
  return total_length
```

This algorithm is inefficient because it calculates the length of each reflection individually. A more efficient algorithm would be to calculate the total length of the trajectory in one go.

**6. Not using a debugger**

When you are debugging a problem, it is helpful to use a debugger. A debugger allows you to step through your code line by line, and it can help you to identify the source of the bug.

**7. Giving up too easily**

Solving a difficult problem can be challenging, but it is important to keep trying. If you get stuck, try to break the problem down into smaller pieces. You can also ask for help from others. With enough perseverance, you will eventually be able to solve the problem.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program's output. For example, if the number of stars in the constellation is not specified in the first line, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data types of the input values may not be correct, which may lead to errors in the program's output. For example, if the x and y coordinates of a star are specified as strings instead of integers, the program may crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, which may lead to errors in the program's output. For example, if the program does not correctly calculate the translation vector, the output may be incorrect.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are common in programming, and they can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program iterates over the input values one index too early or one index too late, the output may be incorrect.
5. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks can occur when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions**. Race conditions can occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is not very clear, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if the input is "9 3 23", it is easy to misinterpret the 23 as the number of sets instead of the sum of the elements.
* **Incorrect calculation of the number of sets:** The formula for calculating the number of sets is quite complex, and it is easy to make a mistake when implementing it. For example, it is easy to forget to add the base case to the DP table.

#Problem: AIZU p01316 Differential Pulse Code Modulation
#Difficulty: 3
#Solution:

def solve(N,M,codes,x):

    for i in range(N-1):
        ans+=(x[i+1]-x[i]-codes[min(abs(x[i+1]-x[i]),M-1)])**2

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading in the data. For example, if you forget to include a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
* **Incorrect codebook.** The codebook is a set of values that can be used to represent the difference between two consecutive values in the input signal. If the codebook is not correct, the program will not be able to find the optimal solution.
* **Incorrect output format.** The output for this problem should be a single number, which is the minimum value of the sum of squares of the difference between the original input signal and the decoded output signal. If you output the wrong format, the program will not be able to correctly evaluate your solution.
* **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm used to solve this problem is fairly straightforward, but it is easy to make a mistake in the implementation. For example, you might forget to update the value of `y` when you add a new value to the codebook.
* **Incorrect error handling.** The program should handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input file does not exist, the program should print an error message and exit.

By following these tips, you can avoid many of the common problems and bugs that developers encounter when solving this problem.

AIZU p01797 Kimagure Cleaner

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. The developer should check the input format and handle it correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is also not always correct. For example, the output may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be in the correct order. The developer should check the output format and handle it correctly.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over a list, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, the developer may accidentally iterate over the list one element too many or one element too few. The developer should be careful to avoid these errors.
4. **Memory leaks.** The developer should be careful to free up memory that is no longer needed. If memory is not freed up, the program may eventually run out of memory and crash.
5. **Race conditions.** If multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is possible for a race condition to occur. A race condition occurs when two threads try to access the same data at the same time, and the outcome depends on the order in which the threads access the data. The developer should be careful to avoid race conditions.
6. **Deadlocks.** A deadlock occurs when two threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, and neither thread can ever release the lock. The developer should be careful to avoid deadlocks.
7. **Buffer overflows.** A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes data to a buffer that is not large enough to hold the data. The data overwrites the next memory location, which can cause the program to crash or to execute arbitrary code. The developer should be careful to avoid buffer overflows.
8. **Format string vulnerabilities.** A format string vulnerability occurs when a program uses a format string that is not properly sanitized. This can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the program, which can be used to take control of the program. The developer should be careful to sanitize format strings correctly.
9. **SQL injection vulnerabilities.** A SQL injection vulnerability occurs when a program allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into a database query. This can allow the attacker to read, modify, or delete data from the database. The developer should be careful to escape all user input before using it in a database query.
10. **Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.** A cross-site scripting vulnerability occurs when a program allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into a web page. This can allow the attacker to steal cookies, hijack sessions, or execute arbitrary code on the user's computer. The developer should be careful to escape all user input before using it in a web page.

1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is a list of intervals, which is represented as a list of tuples. However, the developer may mistakenly treat the input data as a list of integers, which will lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the minimum number of intervals that cover the range $[0, L)$ or the minimum number of intervals that do not cover the range $[0, L)$.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The developer may incorrectly output the results in the wrong format.
4. **Memory leak**. The developer may not release the memory allocated for the input data after the program finishes running, which may lead to a memory leak.
5. **Timeout**. The developer may not optimize the program well enough, which may lead to a timeout error.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input data type, the calculation logic, the output format, and the memory usage. The developer should also optimize the program to improve the performance and avoid timeout errors.

AIZU p02365 Minimum-Cost Arborescence

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of Prim's algorithm.**

Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree in a weighted graph. It works by iteratively adding the edge with the smallest weight that does not create a cycle to the spanning tree. However, if the implementation is incorrect, it is possible that the algorithm will not find a minimum spanning tree, or it may find a tree that is not minimum.

**2. Using an incorrect data structure to represent the graph.**

The data structure used to represent the graph can have a significant impact on the performance of Prim's algorithm. For example, using an adjacency list data structure is more efficient than using an adjacency matrix data structure.

**3. Not handling negative edge weights correctly.**

Prim's algorithm can be used to find a minimum spanning tree in a graph with negative edge weights. However, if the implementation is not careful, it is possible that the algorithm will find a tree that is not minimum.

**4. Using an incorrect termination condition.**

Prim's algorithm terminates when it has found a spanning tree. However, if the implementation is incorrect, it is possible that the algorithm will not terminate, or it may terminate prematurely.

**5. Not handling duplicate edges correctly.**

Prim's algorithm can be used to find a minimum spanning tree in a graph with duplicate edges. However, if the implementation is not careful, it is possible that the algorithm will find a tree that is not minimum.

**6. Not handling disconnected graphs correctly.**

Prim's algorithm can be used to find a minimum spanning tree in a disconnected graph. However, if the implementation is not careful, it is possible that the algorithm will not find a tree that is minimum.

**7. Not handling graphs with self-loops correctly.**

Prim's algorithm can be used to find a minimum spanning tree in a graph with self-loops. However, if the implementation is not careful, it is possible that the algorithm will find a tree that is not minimum.
