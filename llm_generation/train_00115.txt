CODECHEF cdva1605

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input is a list of integers, but the developer may accidentally use a string type. This would cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect loop condition**. The developer may accidentally use an incorrect loop condition, such as `while (i < L)` instead of `while (i < L - K + 1)`. This would cause the program to iterate over the list of integers incorrectly.
3. **Incorrect array index**. The developer may accidentally use an incorrect array index, such as `arr[i][j]` instead of `arr[i][j + K - 1]`. This would cause the program to access invalid memory and crash.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may accidentally use incorrect logic to determine whether a sub-matrix contains all males or females. This would cause the program to output incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect error handling**. The developer may not handle errors correctly, such as if the input is invalid. This could cause the program to crash or output incorrect results.

Title:
CODECHEF multisrm

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not specified in the problem statement. A developer may assume that the input format is `A B`, but the actual input format is `A\nB`. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not specified in the problem statement. A developer may assume that the output format is `A*B`, but the actual output format is `A B`. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Integer overflow**. The problem statement states that the input integers are `1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10^15`. However, the product of two 15-digit integers can be larger than 10^15. This can lead to integer overflow errors.
4. **Time complexity**. The problem statement asks for an efficient algorithm to multiply two integers. A naive algorithm that multiplies the two integers digit-by-digit has a time complexity of O(N^2). This is not efficient enough for multiplying two 15-digit integers.
5. **Space complexity**. The problem statement does not specify the space complexity of the solution. A naive algorithm that multiplies the two integers digit-by-digit has a space complexity of O(N). This is not efficient enough for multiplying two 15-digit integers.

To avoid these problems, a developer should carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. The developer should also consider the time and space complexity of the solution.

#Problem: CODEFORCES 1020_A. New Building for SIS

##############Problem Description##############

The building consists of n towers, h floors each, where the towers are labeled from 1 to n, the floors are labeled from 1 to h. There is a passage between any two adjacent towers (two towers i and i + 1 for all i: 1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) on every floor x, where a ≤ x ≤ b. It takes exactly one minute to walk between any two adjacent floors of a tower, as well as between any two adjacent towers, provided that there is a passage on that floor. It is not permitted to leave the building.

You have given k pairs of locations (ta, fa), (tb, fb): floor fa of tower ta and floor fb of tower tb. For each pair you need to determine the minimum walking time between these locations.

##############Solution##############

n, h, a, b, k = map(int, input().split())

for _ in range(k):
    ta, fa, tb, fb = map(int, input().split())
    # Check if the two towers are adjacent
    if abs(ta - tb) == 1:
        print(1)
    # Check if both floors are on the same floor
    elif fa == fb:
        print(0)
    # Check if the two floors are on adjacent floors
    elif abs(fa - fb) == 1 and a <= fa <= b and a <= fb <= b:
        print(1)
    # Otherwise, the minimum time is the sum of the distances between the two towers and the two floors
    else:
        print(abs(ta - tb) + abs(fa - fb))
```

#### Possible Problems ####

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading in the data. For example, if you forget to put a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output for this problem should be a single integer for each query. Make sure that you format your output correctly, or the judge will not be able to evaluate your solution.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm that you use to solve this problem must be correct, or your solution will not be able to find the correct answer. For example, if you try to use a brute-force algorithm, your solution will not be able to solve the problem in time.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. Even if you have a correct algorithm, your solution will not be able to solve the problem if it is not implemented correctly. For example, if you have a bug in your code, your solution will not be able to find the correct answer.
5. **Memory limit exceeded**. If your solution uses too much memory, it will be disqualified from the competition. Make sure that your solution is as efficient as possible, and that it does not use more memory than is necessary.
6. **Time limit exceeded**. If your solution takes too long to run, it will be disqualified from the competition. Make sure that your solution is as efficient as possible, and that it does not take longer than the time limit.

#### Possible Bugs ####

1. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that can occur when you are counting or indexing. For example, if you are counting the number of elements in an array, you might accidentally miss one or two elements. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Arithmetic errors**. Arithmetic errors can occur when you are performing mathematical operations. For example, if you are dividing two numbers, you might accidentally divide by zero. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Array out-of-bounds errors**. Array out-of-bounds errors can occur when you try to access an element of an array that does not exist. For example, if you try to access the fifth element of an array that only has four elements, this will cause an error.
4. **Null pointer exceptions**. Null pointer exceptions can occur when you try to access a variable that has not been initialized. For example, if you try to print the value of a variable that has not been assigned a value, this will cause a null pointer exception.
5. **ClassCastException**. ClassCastException can occur when you try to cast an object to a class that it does not belong to. For example, if you try to cast a String object to a Integer object, this

Title:
CODEFORCES 1089_A. Alice the Fan

Pain points:
The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program's output. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.
* **Incorrect calculation of set scores:** The program must correctly calculate the set scores for each match. This can be a difficult task, as there are many different ways to score points in volleyball. For example, if one team scores 25 points while the other team scores 24 points, the set is played until the absolute difference between teams' points becomes two. The program must correctly account for this possibility when calculating the set scores.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format for the program must be correct, or the program will not be accepted by the judge. For example, the output must be in the format "x:y", where x is the number of sets won by "Team A" and y is the number of sets won by their opponent.
* **Incorrect handling of edge cases:** The program must correctly handle edge cases, such as when the teams score the same number of points in a set. For example, if both teams score 25 points in a set, the set must be played until the absolute difference between teams' points becomes two. The program must correctly account for this possibility when handling edge cases.

1. **Incorrect implementation of the binary search algorithm.** The binary search algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that can be used to find the position of a target value in a sorted array. However, if the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect, it may not find the correct position of the target value. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the dynamic programming algorithm.** The dynamic programming algorithm is a technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems. The solutions to the subproblems are then used to find the solution to the original problem. However, if the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect, it may not find the correct solution. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm.** The greedy algorithm is a heuristic algorithm that makes locally optimal decisions at each step in order to find a globally optimal solution. However, if the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect, it may not find the correct solution. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect implementation of the divide-and-conquer algorithm.** The divide-and-conquer algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that can be used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems. The solutions to the subproblems are then used to find the solution to the original problem. However, if the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect, it may not find the correct solution. This can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect implementation of the brute-force algorithm.** The brute-force algorithm is an algorithm that solves a problem by trying all possible solutions. However, if the number of possible solutions is large, the brute-force algorithm may not be able to find a solution in a reasonable amount of time. This can lead to incorrect results.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values may not be correctly specified, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input values are specified as strings, the program will not be able to correctly process them.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program does not correctly account for all possible cases, it may produce incorrect results.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the program does not correctly account for the size of the input data. For example, if the program expects the input data to be of size N, but the actual size is N+1, the program will produce incorrect results.
5. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when the program does not correctly release memory that it has allocated. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more parts of the program try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
7. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more parts of the program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish because it is waiting for the other part to finish. This can lead to the program running indefinitely or crashing.
8. **Buffer overflows**. Buffer overflows occur when the program writes data to a buffer that is not large enough to hold the data. This can lead to the program crashing or the execution of arbitrary code.
9. **Format string vulnerabilities**. Format string vulnerabilities occur when the program uses a format string that is not correctly sanitized. This can lead to the program being exploited by an attacker.
10. **SQL injection vulnerabilities**. SQL injection vulnerabilities occur when the program uses user input in a SQL query without properly sanitizing it. This can lead to the program being exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the database.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1213_C. Book Reading

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when reading the input data. For example, if the input contains a number with a comma instead of a space, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the sum of digits**

The sum of digits can be calculated in different ways. The most common way is to use the following formula:

```
sum_of_digits = n % 10 + (n / 10) % 10 + ... + (n / 10^k) % 10
```

However, this formula is not always correct. For example, if n is divisible by 10, the sum of digits will be 0.

**3. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when writing the output data. For example, if the output contains a comma instead of a space, the program will not be accepted.

**4. Runtime errors**

The program may crash if it runs out of memory or if it takes too long to execute. This can happen if the input data is too large or if the program is not optimized properly.

**5. Logical errors**

The program may not work correctly if there are logical errors in the code. For example, if the program does not check for errors in the input data, it may crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1236_D. Alice and the Doll

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not as described in the problem statement. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect maze dimensions.** The maze dimensions must be positive integers and must not exceed 10^5. If the dimensions are incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect number of obstacles.** The number of obstacles must be a non-negative integer and must not exceed 10^5. If the number of obstacles is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
4. **Obstacles in the same cell.** The obstacles must not be in the same cell. If two obstacles are in the same cell, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
5. **Obstacle in the starting cell.** The starting cell (1, 1) must not contain an obstacle. If the starting cell contains an obstacle, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
6. **Incorrect doll movement.** The doll can only move straight or turn right at most once in the same cell. If the doll moves incorrectly, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
7. **Incorrect doll starting direction.** The doll must start in the direction 1, which is along the row from the first cell to the last. If the doll starts in a different direction, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
8. **Incorrect doll ending position.** The doll can end in any position in the maze. If the doll ends in an incorrect position, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
9. **Incorrect output format.** The output must be either "Yes" or "No". If the output format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
10. **Other bugs.** There may be other bugs in the program that are not listed here. These bugs could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1254_B2. Send Boxes to Alice (Hard Version)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input type**. The input type of `n` and `a_i` should be `int`. However, if the input is a string, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect boundary check**. The problem states that `1 <= n <= 10^6` and `0 <= a_i <= 10^6`. However, if the input values are out of range, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm should be able to find the minimum number of seconds for Charlie to make Alice happy. However, if the algorithm is incorrect, the program will output an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format should be a single integer. However, if the output is not a single integer, the program will crash.
5. **Other bugs**. There may be other bugs in the program that are not listed here. For example, the program may not be able to handle negative numbers or floating-point numbers correctly.
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect input type**
```
n = input()
a = input()
```
This code will crash because the input type of `n` and `a` is `str`, not `int`.

2. **Incorrect boundary check**
```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
```
This code will crash if `n` is out of range (`n <= 0`).

3. **Incorrect algorithm**
```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def get_lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 0
for i in range(1, n):
    ans += get_lcm(a[i-1], a[i])

print(ans)
```
This code will output an incorrect answer because it does not consider the case where `a_i = 0`.

4. **Incorrect output format**
```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 0
for i in range(1, n):
    ans += get_lcm(a[i-1], a[i])

print(ans, end=' ')
```
This code will crash because the output format is not a single integer.

5. **Other bugs**
```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 0
for i in range(1, n):
    ans += a[i]

print(ans)
```
This code will output an incorrect answer because it does not consider the case where `a_i < 0`.
Title:
CODEFORCES 1278_B. A and B

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable initialization.** The developer may forget to initialize a variable, which will lead to a runtime error. For example, the following code will not compile:

```
int a, b;
int minOperations(a, b) {
  // Do something with a and b
}
```

To fix this, simply initialize the variables before using them:

```
int a, b;
a = 1;
b = 2;
int minOperations(a, b) {
  // Do something with a and b
}
```

2. **Incorrect data type.** The developer may use the wrong data type for a variable, which will lead to incorrect results. For example, the following code will incorrectly calculate the minimum number of operations:

```
int a, b;
int minOperations(a, b) {
  // Calculate the minimum number of operations
  return a + b;
}
```

To fix this, use the correct data type for the variable. In this case, we should use `long long` instead of `int`:

```
long long a, b;
int minOperations(a, b) {
  // Calculate the minimum number of operations
  return a + b;
}
```

3. **Off-by-one errors.** The developer may accidentally miscount by one, which will lead to incorrect results. For example, the following code will incorrectly calculate the minimum number of operations:

```
int a, b;
int minOperations(a, b) {
  // Calculate the minimum number of operations
  if (a < b) {
    return b - a;
  } else {
    return a - b;
  }
}
```

To fix this, carefully check your code for off-by-one errors. In this case, we can use the following code to correctly calculate the minimum number of operations:

```
int a, b;
int minOperations(a, b) {
  // Calculate the minimum number of operations
  return abs(a - b);
}
```

4. **Logic errors.** The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the code, which will lead to incorrect results. For example, the following code will incorrectly calculate the minimum number of operations:

```
int a, b;
int minOperations(a, b) {
  // Calculate the minimum number of operations
  if (a < b) {
    return minOperations(b, a);
  } else {
    return a + b;
  }
}
```

To fix this, carefully check your code for logic errors. In this case, we can use the following code to correctly calculate the minimum number of operations:

```
int a, b;
int minOperations(a, b) {
  // Calculate the minimum number of operations
  if (a < b) {
    return minOperations(a, b - a);
  } else {
    return minOperations(b, a - b);
  }
}
```

5. **Memory leaks.** The developer may accidentally create a memory leak, which will eventually lead to the program running out of memory. For example, the following code will create a memory leak:

```
int a, b;
int minOperations(a, b) {
  // Calculate the minimum number of operations
  int *p = malloc(sizeof(int));
  *p = a + b;
  return *p;
}
```

To fix this, simply free the memory that is allocated:

```
int a, b;
int minOperations(a, b) {
  // Calculate the minimum number of operations
  int *p = malloc(sizeof(int));
  *p = a + b;
  free(p);
  return *p;
}
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 1297_H. Paint the String

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input string may contain characters that are not lowercase Latin letters.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The algorithm may not consider the last character of the string.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The algorithm may not find the lexicographically minimal string.
4. **Memory leak**. The algorithm may not free the memory allocated for temporary variables.
5. **Incorrect output format**. The algorithm may not print the output in the correct format.
Test inputs:

Title:
CODEFORCES 1321_C. Remove Adjacent

Pain points:
**1. Off-by-one errors**

When iterating through the string, it is easy to make off-by-one errors. For example, if you are trying to find the index of the first character that is not equal to the previous character, you might start at index 1 instead of index 0. This would cause you to miss the first character in the string.

**2. Index out of bounds errors**

When iterating through the string, it is also easy to make index out of bounds errors. For example, if you are trying to find the index of the last character that is not equal to the previous character, you might try to access the element at index |s|, which is outside the bounds of the string.

**3. Incorrect use of pointers**

When working with strings, it is important to use pointers correctly. For example, if you are trying to compare two strings, you should make sure that you are comparing the pointers to the strings, not the strings themselves.

**4. Forgetting to initialize variables**

When working with variables, it is important to initialize them to a safe value. For example, if you are declaring a variable to store the length of a string, you should initialize it to 0. This will prevent you from getting unexpected results if the string is empty.

**5. Using the wrong data type**

When working with strings, it is important to use the correct data type. For example, if you are trying to store the length of a string, you should use an integer, not a character.

**6. Not handling corner cases**

When writing code, it is important to handle corner cases. For example, if you are writing a function to reverse a string, you should handle the case where the string is empty.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1340_B. Nastya and Scoreboard

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

1. **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is `1 7 a`, the program will try to parse the `a` as an integer, which will fail.
2. **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correctly generated, which can lead to the program being rejected by the judge. For example, if the output is `1234567`, the judge will expect the output to be a single number, not a sequence of numbers.
3. **Incorrect logic:** The program may contain logical errors, such as incorrect calculations or incorrect data structures. For example, if the program tries to divide by zero, it will crash.
4. **Incorrect error handling:** The program may not handle errors correctly, such as when the input is invalid or when the program runs out of memory. For example, if the program tries to access a memory location that does not exist, it will crash.
5. **Incorrect performance:** The program may run too slowly or use too much memory. For example, if the program uses a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem, it will be very slow.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully test your code and to make sure that it is correct and efficient.
Test inputs:
**Incorrect input format:**
```
1 7 a
```

**Incorrect output format:**
```
1234567
```

**Incorrect logic:**
```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
arr = [input() for i in range(n)]
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(7):
        if arr[i][j] == '0' and j != k:
            arr[i][j] = '1'
print(''.join(arr))
```

This program will crash because it tries to access the memory location `arr[n]`, which does not exist.

**Incorrect error handling:**
```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
arr = [input() for i in range(n)]
try:
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(7):
            if arr[i][j] == '0' and j != k:
                arr[i][j] = '1'
    print(''.join(arr))
except:
    print('-1')
```

This program will not handle the case where the input is invalid. For example, if the input is `1 7 a`, the program will crash because it tries to parse the `a` as an integer.

**Incorrect performance:**
```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
arr = [input() for i in range(n)]
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(7):
        if arr[i][j] == '0' and j != k:
            arr[i][j] = '1'
print(''.join(arr))
```

This program is very slow because it has to iterate over the entire array of digits twice. A more efficient solution would be to use a hash table to store the digits that are already turned on.

**Correct input format:**
```
1 7
0000000
```

**Correct output format:**
```
8
```

**Correct logic:**
```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
arr = [input() for i in range(n)]
# Create a hash table to store the digits that are already turned on.
digits = {}
for i in range(7):
    digits[i] = False
# Iterate over the array of digits and turn on the ones that are not already turned on.
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(7):
        if arr[i][j] == '0' and j not in digits:
            digits[j] = True
# Print the maximum number that can be obtained if you turn on exactly k sticks.
max_num = 0
for num in digits:
    if num + k <= 7:
        max_num = max(max_num, 10**(7 - num - k) + 10**(num - 1))
print(max_num)
```

This program is correct and efficient. It correctly handles the case where the input is invalid and it runs in O(n) time.
Title:
CODEFORCES 1362_B. Johnny and His Hobbies

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of bitwise operators.** Bitwise operators are powerful tools, but they can also be dangerous if used incorrectly. For example, the following code will not produce the desired output:

```
k = 0
for s in S:
    k ^= s
print(k)
```

This code will print the bitwise XOR of all the elements in S, not the smallest positive integer that satisfies the conditions. To fix this, we can use the following code:

```
k = 0
for s in S:
    k = min(k, s)
print(k)
```

2. **Incorrect use of sets.** Sets are a powerful data structure, but they can also be dangerous if used incorrectly. For example, the following code will not produce the desired output:

```
S = set()
for s in input().split():
    S.add(int(s))
print(min(S))
```

This code will print the smallest element in S, not the smallest positive integer that satisfies the conditions. To fix this, we can use the following code:

```
S = set()
for s in input().split():
    S.add(int(s))
k = 0
for s in S:
    k = min(k, s)
print(k)
```

3. **Incorrect use of the exclusive or operator.** The exclusive or operator (^) is a bitwise operator that returns a 1 if exactly one of its operands is a 1. For example, the following code will print 1:

```
print(0 ^ 1)
```

However, the exclusive or operator does not work the same way when used with sets. For example, the following code will print 2:

```
S = set([0, 1])
print(S ^ S)
```

This is because the exclusive or operator is applied to each element in the set, not to the set as a whole. To fix this, we can use the following code:

```
S = set([0, 1])
print(min(S))
```

4. **Incorrect use of the minimum function.** The minimum function (min) returns the smallest element in a list. For example, the following code will print 0:

```
print(min([0, 1]))
```

However, the minimum function does not work the same way when used with sets. For example, the following code will print 1:

```
S = set([0, 1])
print(min(S))
```

This is because the minimum function is applied to each element in the set, not to the set as a whole. To fix this, we can use the following code:

```
S = set([0, 1])
print(min(S))
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 1382_C2. Prefix Flip (Hard Version)

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**

The input format of the problem is:

```
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Next 3t lines contain descriptions of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤ n≤ 10^5) — the length of the binary strings.

The next two lines contain two binary strings a and b of length n.
```

If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to read the input correctly and will give incorrect output.

**2. The output format is not correct**

The output format of the problem is:

```
For each test case, output an integer k (0≤ k≤ 2n), followed by k integers p_1,…,p_k (1≤ p_i≤ n). Here k is the number of operations you use and p_i is the length of the prefix you flip in the i-th operation.
```

If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to write the output correctly and will get a Wrong Answer verdict.

**3. The program does not work correctly**

There are many possible reasons why a program might not work correctly. Some common reasons include:

* The program is not implemented correctly.
* The program is not using the correct data structures or algorithms.
* The program is not handling errors correctly.
* The program is not taking into account all of the constraints of the problem.

If the program does not work correctly, it will get a Wrong Answer verdict.

**4. The program runs too slowly**

The program is allowed to run for a maximum of 2 seconds. If the program runs for longer than 2 seconds, it will get a Time Limit Exceeded verdict.

There are many possible reasons why a program might run too slowly. Some common reasons include:

* The program is using inefficient algorithms.
* The program is using too much memory.
* The program is not parallelized.

If the program runs too slowly, it will get a Time Limit Exceeded verdict.

**5. The program uses too much memory**

The program is allowed to use a maximum of 256 MB of memory. If the program uses more than 256 MB of memory, it will get a Memory Limit Exceeded verdict.

There are many possible reasons why a program might use too much memory. Some common reasons include:

* The program is using large data structures.
* The program is not freeing memory that is no longer needed.
* The program is using too much recursion.

If the program uses too much memory, it will get a Memory Limit Exceeded verdict.

CODEFORCES 1425_C. Captain of Knights

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the knight's movement rules.** The knight can only move to squares that are 3 units away in any direction, so it is important to check that the proposed move is valid before adding it to the total number of moves.
2. **Off-by-one errors in the calculation of G(X, Y).** The sum of the number of moves from each square to (X, Y) should be equal to G(X, Y), so it is important to make sure that all of the squares are included in the calculation.
3. **Modulo arithmetic errors.** The output of the program should be modulo 10^9 + 7, so it is important to make sure that all of the intermediate calculations are also modulo 10^9 + 7.
4. **Runtime errors.** The program should run in polynomial time, so it is important to avoid using inefficient algorithms or data structures.
5. **Memory errors.** The program should not use more memory than is necessary, so it is important to use efficient data structures and to free up memory when it is no longer needed.

CODEFORCES 1471_B. Strange List

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct.**

The input format for this problem is:

```
t
n x
a_1, a_2, ..., a_n
```

where:

* `t` is the number of test cases.
* `n` is the length of the array.
* `x` is the value used by the robot.
* `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are the initial values in the array.

If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce an incorrect output.

**2. The robot does not process all of the elements in the array.**

The robot is supposed to process all of the elements in the array, even if they are not divisible by `x`. If the robot does not process all of the elements in the array, the sum of the elements in the resulting array will be incorrect.

**3. The robot adds the wrong number of copies of an element to the end of the array.**

The robot is supposed to add `x` copies of an element to the end of the array if the element is divisible by `x`. If the robot adds the wrong number of copies of an element to the end of the array, the sum of the elements in the resulting array will be incorrect.

**4. The program does not correctly handle negative numbers.**

The problem statement does not specify whether or not negative numbers are allowed in the input. If negative numbers are allowed, the program must correctly handle them. If negative numbers are not allowed, the program must throw an error if a negative number is encountered in the input.

**5. The program does not correctly handle overflow.**

The sum of the elements in the array may overflow if the array is large enough. The program must correctly handle overflow and not produce an incorrect output.

**6. The program does not correctly terminate.**

The program must terminate after processing all of the test cases. If the program does not terminate, it will continue to run indefinitely and consume resources.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1547_F. Array Stabilization (GCD version)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the greatest common divisor (GCD)**. The GCD of two numbers is the largest integer that divides both of them evenly. A common mistake is to use the formula `gcd(a, b) = a * b / lcm(a, b)`, where `lcm(a, b)` is the least common multiple of `a` and `b`. However, this formula is only correct if `a` and `b` are relatively prime, meaning that they have no common factors other than 1. If `a` and `b` are not relatively prime, then the formula will return a value that is larger than the actual GCD.
2. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator (`%`)**. The modulo operator returns the remainder of a division operation. A common mistake is to use the modulo operator to check if two numbers are equal. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
if (a == b) {
  // do something
}
```

This code will only work if `a` and `b` are both divisible by the same number. If `a` and `b` are not divisible by the same number, then the modulo operator will return a non-zero value, and the code will not execute the `do something` block.
3. **Incorrect handling of negative numbers**. The GCD of two negative numbers is the same as the GCD of their absolute values. A common mistake is to try to take the GCD of two negative numbers using the following code:

```
gcd(a, b) = abs(a) * abs(b) / abs(gcd(abs(a), abs(b)))
```

This code will not work correctly because the absolute value of the GCD of two negative numbers is not the same as the GCD of their absolute values.
4. **Incorrect handling of floating-point numbers**. The GCD of two floating-point numbers is not well-defined. A common mistake is to try to calculate the GCD of two floating-point numbers using the following code:

```
gcd(a, b) = math.gcd(a, b)
```

This code will not work correctly because the `math.gcd()` function does not work correctly for floating-point numbers.
5. **Incorrect handling of zero**. The GCD of zero and any other number is zero. A common mistake is to try to calculate the GCD of zero and another number using the following code:

```
gcd(a, b) = a if b == 0 else b
```

This code will not work correctly because the `if` statement will always evaluate to `a` because `b == 0`.
6. **Incorrect handling of infinity**. The GCD of infinity and any other number is infinity. A common mistake is to try to calculate the GCD of infinity and another number using the following code:

```
gcd(a, b) = a if b == infinity else b
```

This code will not work correctly because the `if` statement will always evaluate to `a` because `b == infinity`.

Title:
CODEFORCES 175_C. Geometry Horse

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to put a space between two numbers, the input parser will fail.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output for this problem should be a single integer. Make sure to format your output correctly, or the judge will not be able to accept it.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. This problem involves a lot of arithmetic, and it's easy to make a mistake and get the wrong answer. Be careful when computing the maximum number of points, and make sure to check your work carefully.
4. **Incorrect data structures**. The data structures you use to solve this problem can have a big impact on the performance of your code. Make sure to choose data structures that are appropriate for the problem, and use them efficiently.
5. **Unnecessary complexity**. This problem can be solved in a relatively straightforward way. Don't try to over-engineer your solution, or you'll just make it more complicated and harder to debug.

CODEFORCES 195_D. Analyzing Polyline

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very clear. It is not immediately obvious what the meaning of the `ki` and `bi` values is. This could lead to a developer incorrectly parsing the input and getting the wrong answer.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the number of angles**

The problem statement states that the graph of the sum of the given functions is a polyline. However, it is not immediately obvious how to calculate the number of angles in a polyline. A developer could incorrectly calculate the number of angles and get the wrong answer.

**3. Incorrect output format**

The problem statement states that the output should be a single number. However, a developer could incorrectly output multiple numbers or a string instead of a number. This would result in a runtime error.

**4. Memory issues**

The problem statement does not specify the maximum size of the input. This could lead to a developer allocating too much memory for the input data, which could cause a memory overflow.

**5. Time complexity**

The problem statement does not specify a time limit. This could lead to a developer implementing a solution that has a very high time complexity, which would result in a timeout.

CODEFORCES 219_D. Choosing Capital for Treeland

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**. The input format should be ```
n
s1 t1
s2 t2
...
s(n-1) t(n-1)
```, where `n` is the number of cities, `si` and `ti` are the start and end points of the `i`-th road.

**2. The output format is not correct**. The output format should be ```
min_num_of_inversed_roads

Title:
CODEFORCES 243_A. The Brand New Function

Pain points:
### Possible Problems and Bugs

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain an integer `n` (the number of elements in the sequence), and the second line should contain `n` space-separated integers `a1, a2, ..., an` (the elements of the sequence). However, if the input format is not followed, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect use of bitwise operators**. The problem statement specifies that the function `f(l, r)` should be calculated as the bitwise OR of all the elements of the sequence with indexes from `l` to `r`. However, if the bitwise operators are not used correctly, the program may produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect use of loops**. The problem statement requires that the program iterate over all possible values of `l` and `r` and calculate the value of `f(l, r)` for each pair. However, if the loops are not used correctly, the program may not iterate over all possible values of `l` and `r`, or it may iterate over the values multiple times, resulting in incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect use of data structures**. The problem statement does not specify any specific data structures that must be used to solve the problem. However, if the wrong data structures are used, the program may not be able to store the data efficiently, resulting in incorrect output or a time limit exceeded error.
5. **Incorrect algorithm**. The problem statement does not specify a specific algorithm that must be used to solve the problem. However, if the wrong algorithm is used, the program may not be able to find the correct answer, or it may take an excessive amount of time to find the answer.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to use the correct data structures and algorithms to solve the problem. By following these guidelines, you can help to ensure that your program is correct and efficient.

CODEFORCES 268_D. Wall Bars

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format should be `n h`, where `n` and `h` are integers. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect values of `n` and `h`.** The values of `n` and `h` should be integers between 1 and 1000, and `h` should be less than or equal to `min(n, 30)`. If the values of `n` and `h` are incorrect, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of designs.** The number of designs can be calculated using the following formula:

```
dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % 1000000009
```

where `dp[i][j]` is the number of designs with `i` bars and `j` bars at a distance of at most `h` from the ground. This formula is correct, but it is not efficient. A more efficient way to calculate the number of designs is to use dynamic programming.
4. **Incorrect modulo operation.** The modulo operation is used to ensure that the number of designs is less than 1000000009. If the modulo operation is not performed correctly, the program will produce incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer, which is the remainder of the number of designs divided by 1000000009. If the output format is incorrect, the program will crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 316_D1. PE Lesson

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be `n`, followed by `n` space-separated integers. For example, `5` followed by `1 2 2 1 2`.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer, modulo 1000000007. For example, `120`.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The number of ball orders should be calculated as follows:

```
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j-1] * (i - j + 1)
```

where `dp[i][j]` is the number of ball orders after `i` throws, where the first `j` balls are in their original positions.
4. **Memory limit exceeded**. The input size is limited to 1000000, so the solution should not use more than 1000000 bits of memory.
5. **Time limit exceeded**. The solution should run in O(n^2) time.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. Use the `assert` statement to check the input format. For example, you could use the following code to check that the input is a single integer:

```
n = int(input())
assert n > 0
```

2. Use the `%` operator to print the output modulo 1000000007. For example, you could use the following code to print the output of `120`:

```
print(120 % 1000000007)
```

3. Use the following formula to calculate the number of ball orders:

```
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j-1] * (i - j + 1)
```

4. Use a dynamic programming approach to reduce the time complexity to O(n^2). For example, you could use the following code to calculate the number of ball orders:

```
dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 1
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    for j in range(0, n + 1):
        dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j-1] * (i - j + 1)

print(dp[n][n])
```

5. Use the following optimizations to reduce the memory usage:

* Use a sparse table to store the values of `dp[i][j]` for all `i` and `j`.
* Use a bitmask to represent the balls that are in their original positions.

Here is an example of a solution that avoids all of the above problems:

```
def main():
    n = int(input())
    assert n > 0

    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(0, n + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j-1] * (i - j + 1)

    print(dp[n][n])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Title:
CODEFORCES 339_D. Xenia and Bit Operations

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect implementation of XOR and OR operations

The XOR and OR operations are commonly implemented using bitwise operators, but it is important to be careful with the order of operands. For example, the following code will not produce the correct result:

```
a = 0b1100
b = 0b0110
print(a | b)  # 0b1110
```

The correct way to implement these operations is to use the following code:

```
a = 0b1100
b = 0b0110
print(a ^ b)  # 0b1010
```

### 2. Using the wrong data type

The input and output of this problem are both lists of integers. It is important to use the correct data type for these lists, otherwise the program will not work correctly. For example, the following code will not produce the correct output:

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
for _ in range(m):
    p, b = map(int, input().split())
    print(a[p])
```

The correct way to write this code is as follows:

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
for _ in range(m):
    p, b = map(int, input().split())
    a[p] = b
    print(a[0])
```

### 3. Not handling edge cases

The input to this problem may contain edge cases, such as negative integers or lists of different lengths. It is important to handle these edge cases correctly, otherwise the program will not work correctly. For example, the following code will not work correctly if the input list contains a negative integer:

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
for _ in range(m):
    p, b = map(int, input().split())
    a[p] = b
    print(a[0])
```

The correct way to handle this edge case is as follows:

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
for _ in range(m):
    p, b = map(int, input().split())
    if b < 0:
        raise ValueError("b must be non-negative")
    a[p] = b
    print(a[0])
```

### 4. Using inefficient algorithms

The Xenia and Bit Operations problem can be solved using a simple algorithm that iterates over the list of queries and updates the value of v accordingly. However, this algorithm is inefficient for large values of n and m. A more efficient algorithm can be used by using a bitset to represent the sequence a. A bitset is a data structure that can store a set of bits, and it can be used to perform bitwise operations on the sequence a more efficiently.

### 5. Not using the resources available

The Xenia and Bit Operations problem can be solved using a variety of resources, such as online judges, programming forums, and textbooks. It is important to use these resources to your advantage, as they can help you to learn new algorithms and techniques. For example, the following resources can be used to solve this problem:

* [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/339/D)
* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/xenia-and-bit-operations/)

CODEFORCES 433_D. Nanami's Digital Board

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable initialization**. For example, initializing `n` to 0 will cause an error when you try to access `n` later in your code.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. These are common when you're working with arrays or other data structures. Make sure you're checking the bounds of your indices carefully.
3. **Logical errors**. These are errors in your code that cause it to produce incorrect results. Be careful to check for all possible cases and make sure your code is working as intended.
4. **Memory leaks**. These occur when you allocate memory but don't free it up when you're done with it. This can cause your program to run out of memory and crash.
5. **Synchronization errors**. These occur when multiple threads are trying to access the same data at the same time. This can cause your program to produce incorrect results or crash.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. These can allow attackers to access your data or take control of your system. Make sure you're following good security practices to protect your code from attack.

Here are some specific tips for avoiding these problems when solving the Nanami's Digital Board problem:

* **Use a debugger**. A debugger can help you identify errors in your code by letting you step through it line by line and watch how it's behaving.
* **Test your code**. Write unit tests to verify that your code is working as expected. This will help you catch errors early on before they cause problems in production.
* **Use the right data structures**. The data structures you choose can have a big impact on the performance of your code. Make sure you're using the right data structures for the task at hand.
* **Write clear and concise code**. Your code should be easy to read and understand. This will make it easier to debug and maintain.
* **Document your code**. Documentation can help other developers understand how your code works. This can be especially helpful if you're working on a team or if you're planning to share your code with others.

By following these tips, you can help reduce the chances of encountering problems when solving the Nanami's Digital Board problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 478_D. Red-Green Towers

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect modular arithmetic**

When working with modulo arithmetic, it is important to be aware of the following rules:

* `(a + b) % m = (a % m + b % m) % m`
* `(a - b) % m = (a % m - b % m) % m`
* `(a * b) % m = (a % m * b % m) % m`
* `a ^ b % m = ((a % m) ^ b) % m`

It is also important to remember that the modulo operator has a higher precedence than the arithmetic operators, so expressions like `a + b % m` should be written as `(a + b) % m`.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

When working with arrays, it is important to be aware of the fact that the first element of the array has index 0. This can lead to off-by-one errors if you are not careful.

For example, the following code will not work as expected:

```
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  // Do something with arr[i]
}
```

This code will actually iterate over the elements of the array from index 1 to `arr.length - 1`, which will skip the first element.

To avoid this problem, you can either use the `for-each` loop, or explicitly check for the case where `i == 0`.

**3. Using the wrong data type**

When working with large numbers, it is important to use the correct data type. For example, if you are working with numbers that are larger than 2 ** 31 - 1, you should use the `long` data type instead of the `int` data type.

**4. Not using the right algorithm**

There are many different algorithms for solving different problems. It is important to choose the right algorithm for the problem you are trying to solve.

For example, if you are trying to find the maximum element in an array, you could use a linear search algorithm, or you could use a binary search algorithm. The linear search algorithm will take O(n) time, while the binary search algorithm will take O(log n) time.

**5. Not handling edge cases**

When writing code, it is important to handle all of the possible edge cases. For example, if you are writing a function to divide two numbers, you need to handle the case where the denominator is zero.

**6. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before you deploy it to production. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed.

There are many different ways to test your code. You can use unit tests, integration tests, and system tests.

**7. Not using version control**

Version control is a system that tracks changes to your code over time. This allows you to roll back to previous versions of your code if you need to.

Version control systems like Git and Mercurial are very easy to use, and they can save you a lot of time and headaches.

**8. Not documenting your code**

It is important to document your code so that other developers can understand what it does. This will make it easier for other developers to maintain and extend your code.

You can document your code using comments, docstrings, and documentation strings.

CODEFORCES 5_D. Follow Traffic Rules

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always followed correctly. For example, the input may contain a letter instead of a number. The developer should check the input format and raise an error if it is incorrect.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output should be formatted correctly. For example, the output should have exactly five digits after the decimal point. The developer should check the output format and raise an error if it is incorrect.

**3. Undefined behavior**

The code may behave in an unexpected way if the input data is invalid. For example, the code may divide by zero or access a memory location that is out of bounds. The developer should check for undefined behavior and raise an error if it occurs.

**4. Race conditions**

The code may not be thread-safe. For example, two threads may try to access the same data at the same time. The developer should make sure that the code is thread-safe.

**5. Deadlocks**

The code may deadlock. For example, two threads may wait for each other to release a lock. The developer should make sure that the code does not deadlock.

**6. Memory leaks**

The code may leak memory. For example, the code may not free memory that is no longer needed. The developer should make sure that the code does not leak memory.

**7. Security vulnerabilities**

The code may contain security vulnerabilities. For example, the code may allow a malicious user to gain access to sensitive data. The developer should make sure that the code does not contain any security vulnerabilities.

CODEFORCES 622_B. The Time

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format is hh:mm, where hh and mm are integers between 0 and 23 and 0 and 59, respectively. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash. For example, if the input is "12:34a", the program will throw an error.

### 2. Incorrect calculation of the number of minutes

The number of minutes passed is calculated by adding the number of minutes in the input to the number of minutes in the current time. However, if the number of minutes passed is greater than 60, the program will need to add 1 to the number of hours and subtract 60 from the number of minutes. For example, if the current time is 10:00 and the number of minutes passed is 70, the program will calculate the number of minutes as 70 + 60 = 130. Since 130 is greater than 60, the program will need to add 1 to the number of hours and subtract 60 from the number of minutes. The final time will be 11:30.

### 3. Incorrect output format

The output format is hh:mm, where hh and mm are integers between 0 and 23 and 0 and 59, respectively. The program should print the hours and the minutes with two digits, even if they are less than 10. For example, if the time is 10:00, the program should print 10:00, not 1:00.

### 4. Off-by-one errors

When calculating the number of minutes passed, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, if the current time is 10:00 and the number of minutes passed is 60, the program might calculate the number of minutes as 61 instead of 60. This would result in the wrong time being printed.

### 5. Memory leaks

The program should be careful not to create any memory leaks. This can be done by freeing up memory that is no longer needed. For example, if the program is using a temporary array to store the current time, the array should be freed up after the time is printed.

CODEFORCES 643_E. Bear and Destroying Subtrees

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the dynamic programming algorithm.** The most common mistake is to forget to update the values of the dp array when adding a new vertex. This can lead to incorrect results, especially for large trees.
2. **Incorrect handling of queries of the second type.** When a query of the second type is processed, the dp array must be updated to reflect the fact that the subtree rooted at the given vertex has been destroyed. This can be done by simply setting the value of the dp array at the given vertex to 0.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the expected value of the penalty.** The expected value of the penalty is equal to the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes, weighted by the corresponding penalties. This can be calculated using the following formula:

```
E[penalty] = sum(p * penalty_i)
```

where p is the probability of the i-th outcome and penalty_i is the corresponding penalty.
4. **Floating-point arithmetic errors.** When calculating the expected value of the penalty, it is important to use floating-point arithmetic with the correct precision. This can be done by using the `double` type in C++ or the `Decimal` type in Java.
5. **Timeout errors.** The dynamic programming algorithm for this problem can be very time-consuming, especially for large trees. To avoid timeout errors, it is important to use an efficient implementation of the algorithm.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use a debugger to help you track down errors in your implementation.
* Test your code on a variety of input data sets to make sure that it is correct.
* Use the `assert` macro to check for errors in your code.
* Use a compiler with optimizations to help your code run faster.
* Use a memory profiler to help you identify memory leaks in your code.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is specified in the problem statement. Make sure that your code correctly parses the input.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** The output of the program should be a single digit, 0 or 1. Make sure that you are not outputting an incorrect number of digits.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The problem statement specifies that the output should be the same as the first digit of the input. Make sure that your code correctly implements this logic.
4. **Memory leaks.** Make sure that your code does not leak memory. This can be a common problem when using dynamic memory allocation.
5. **Race conditions.** Race conditions can occur when multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time. Make sure that your code is thread-safe.
6. **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks can occur when multiple threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. Make sure that your code does not deadlock.
7. **Buffer overflows.** Buffer overflows can occur when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold. Make sure that your code does not overflow any buffers.
8. **Format string vulnerabilities.** Format string vulnerabilities can occur when a program uses a format string that is not properly sanitized. Make sure that your code does not contain any format string vulnerabilities.
9. **SQL injection vulnerabilities.** SQL injection vulnerabilities can occur when a program passes user input directly to an SQL statement. Make sure that your code does not contain any SQL injection vulnerabilities.
10. **Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.** Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities can occur when a program allows users to inject malicious code into a web page. Make sure that your code does not contain any cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

CODEFORCES 805_D. Minimum number of steps

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of "ab" substrings.** This is the most common mistake, and it's easy to make if you're not careful. To avoid this, make sure you're only counting substrings that start with an "a" and end with a "b".
2. **Not using the modulo operator correctly.** The modulo operator (%) is used to find the remainder of a division operation. This means that if you divide a number by 109 + 7, the remainder will always be between 0 and 109 + 6. This is important to keep in mind when you're printing the final answer, as you need to make sure it's also between 0 and 109 + 6.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are a few different algorithms that you can use to solve this problem. The most efficient algorithm is to use dynamic programming. This involves building up a table of the minimum number of steps required to transform a given string into a string with no "ab" substrings.
4. **Not handling the input correctly.** The input for this problem is a string of letters 'a' and 'b'. Make sure you're reading the input correctly and storing it in a variable that you can use later.
5. **Not handling the output correctly.** The output for this problem is a single integer. Make sure you're printing the output correctly and that it's within the range of 0 and 109 + 6.
Test inputs:
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 830_D. Singer House

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the recursive function.** The recursive function should take into account the fact that the same vertex can be visited multiple times. For example, the following code would return the wrong answer for the input `k = 2`:

```
def count_paths(k):
  if k == 0:
    return 1
  return count_paths(k - 1) * 2
```

The correct implementation would be:

```
def count_paths(k):
  if k == 0:
    return 1
  return count_paths(k - 1) * (2 ** k)
```

2. **Using the wrong modulo operator.** The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder of a division. This means that if you divide a number by 109 + 7, the remainder will always be less than 109 + 7. However, the answer to this problem can be greater than 109 + 7. To avoid this problem, you can use the modulo operator `//` instead of `%`. The operator `//` returns the quotient of a division, which means that it will always truncate the remainder.

3. **Not handling the edge case where `k = 0`.** The input for this problem can be 0. If `k = 0`, then there is only one possible path, which is the empty path. You should handle this case by returning 1.

4. **Not using the fact that the answer is symmetric.** The answer to this problem is symmetric, meaning that it does not matter which vertex you start from. You can use this fact to reduce the amount of computation that you need to do.

5. **Not using the fact that the answer is a Catalan number.** The answer to this problem is a Catalan number. Catalan numbers can be computed using the following formula:

```
C_n = (4n)! / (n!(2n)!)
```

You can use this formula to compute the answer to this problem more efficiently.

CODEFORCES 851_E. Arpa and a game with Mojtaba

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data is a list of integers, so we need to use the `int` data type to store the numbers. If we use the `str` data type, we will get a runtime error.

**2. Not handling corner cases**

The input data may contain corner cases, such as a list of all 1s or a list of all prime numbers. We need to handle these corner cases correctly.

**3. Making incorrect assumptions**

We need to make sure that we understand the problem correctly. For example, we need to make sure that Mojtaba starts the game and that the players alternately make moves.

**4. Using inefficient algorithms**

We can use a brute-force algorithm to solve this problem, but it will be very inefficient. We can use a more efficient algorithm, such as a greedy algorithm, to solve the problem.

**5. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code to make sure that it works correctly. We can test the code with a variety of input data, including corner cases.

CODEFORCES 876_A. Trip For Meal

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is:

```
1 ≤ n ≤ 100
1 ≤ a ≤ 100
1 ≤ b ≤ 100
1 ≤ c ≤ 100
```

If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will output an incorrect answer.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is:

```
The minimum distance in meters Winnie must go through to have a meal n times.
```

If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will output an incorrect answer.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the minimum distance**

The minimum distance that Winnie must go through to have a meal n times is the sum of the distances between each of the houses. For example, if the distances between the houses are 2, 3, and 1, the minimum distance is 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.

**4. Using incorrect data types**

The data types used to store the input and output values must be correct. For example, the input values should be stored as integers, and the output value should be stored as a floating-point number.

**5. Using incorrect algorithms**

The algorithm used to calculate the minimum distance must be correct. For example, the algorithm should not take into account the distance between houses that Winnie has already visited.

**6. Using incorrect logic**

The logic used to calculate the minimum distance must be correct. For example, the logic should not assume that Winnie will always visit each house the same number of times.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always strictly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a letter that is not a lowercase Latin letter, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format must be strictly followed, otherwise the program will not be accepted. For example, if the output contains a space between words, the program will be rejected.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program must correctly implement the logic of the problem. For example, if the program does not check if the train moves all the time, it will give the wrong answer.
4. **Incorrect error handling**. The program must handle errors correctly. For example, if the input file does not exist, the program should exit with an error message.
5. **Incorrect testing**. The program must be tested thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly. For example, the program should be tested with different input data to make sure that it gives the correct output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 921_01. Labyrinth-1

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
* **Off-by-one errors:** When dealing with arrays and matrices, it is very easy to make an off-by-one error. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic of the program must be correct in order for it to solve the problem. A small mistake in the logic can cause the program to fail to find a solution, or to find an incorrect solution.
* **Infinite loops:** The program must not enter an infinite loop. This can happen if the program is not properly terminated, or if there is a bug in the logic that causes the program to repeat the same steps over and over again.
* **Out-of-bounds errors:** The program must not access memory that it is not allowed to access. This can happen if the program tries to access an element of an array that does not exist, or if it tries to access a memory address that is outside of the allocated memory space.
* **Memory leaks:** The program must not leak memory. This can happen if the program does not free memory that it has allocated. Memory leaks can eventually cause the program to crash.

**Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:**

* **Be careful when reading the input format.** Make sure that you understand the format of the input and that you are parsing it correctly.
* **Use a debugger to check your code.** A debugger can help you to find errors in your code by allowing you to step through the code line by line and watch the values of variables change.
* **Test your code thoroughly.** Test your code with a variety of different inputs to make sure that it is working correctly.
* **Use a style guide to format your code.** A style guide can help you to write your code in a consistent and readable way.
* **Document your code.** Documenting your code can help other developers to understand how your code works.
* **Use version control.** Using version control can help you to track changes to your code and to roll back to previous versions if necessary.
* **Keep your code secure.** Make sure that your code is secure by following security best practices.

Title:
CODEFORCES 977_E. Cyclic Components

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect graph representation**

The first step is to represent the graph. A common mistake is to represent the graph as an adjacency list, where each vertex is represented by a list of its adjacent vertices. This can lead to incorrect results if the graph contains cycles, as the adjacency list will not be able to represent the cyclic dependencies between vertices.

To avoid this problem, it is better to represent the graph as an adjacency matrix, where each entry in the matrix represents the existence of an edge between two vertices. This representation will correctly capture the cyclic dependencies between vertices, and will allow you to correctly identify the connected components that are also cycles.

**2. Incorrect identification of connected components**

Once the graph has been represented, the next step is to identify the connected components. A common mistake is to simply iterate over the vertices of the graph and add each vertex to its own connected component. This will not work correctly if the graph contains cycles, as the vertices in a cycle will be incorrectly identified as belonging to different connected components.

To avoid this problem, it is better to use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to identify the connected components. A DFS algorithm starts at a random vertex and recursively explores all of the vertices that are reachable from that vertex. As it explores the vertices, the DFS algorithm keeps track of the connected components that it has visited. This allows it to correctly identify the connected components that are also cycles.

**3. Incorrect identification of cycles**

Once the connected components have been identified, the next step is to identify the cycles. A common mistake is to simply iterate over the connected components and check if each connected component is a cycle. This will not work correctly if the graph contains multiple cycles, as the connected components may not be disjoint.

To avoid this problem, it is better to use a cycle-finding algorithm to identify the cycles. A cycle-finding algorithm starts at a random vertex and recursively explores all of the vertices that are reachable from that vertex. As it explores the vertices, the cycle-finding algorithm keeps track of the vertices that it has visited. If the algorithm returns to a vertex that it has already visited, then it has found a cycle.

**4. Incorrect counting of cycles**

Once the cycles have been identified, the final step is to count the number of cycles. A common mistake is to simply count the number of connected components that are also cycles. This will not work correctly if the graph contains multiple cycles, as the connected components may not be disjoint.

To avoid this problem, it is better to use a cycle-counting algorithm to count the number of cycles. A cycle-counting algorithm starts at a random vertex and recursively explores all of the vertices that are reachable from that vertex. As it explores the vertices, the cycle-counting algorithm keeps track of the number of cycles that it has found.

**5. Incorrect output**

The final step is to output the number of connected components that are also cycles. A common mistake is to simply print the number of cycles. This will not work correctly if the graph contains multiple cycles, as the output may not be unique.

To avoid this problem, it is better to use a unique identifier for each cycle. This can be done by using a hash function to generate a unique identifier for each cycle. The output should then be the list of unique identifiers for the cycles.

Title:
CODEFORCES 997_C. Sky Full of Stars

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulo operation.** When calculating the number of lucky colorings, it is important to use the modulo operation correctly. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
def count_lucky_colorings(n):
  # Calculate the number of ways to color each row and column.
  num_row_colorings = 3 ** n
  num_col_colorings = 3 ** n

  # Calculate the number of lucky colorings.
  num_lucky_colorings = num_row_colorings * num_col_colorings

  # Return the number of lucky colorings modulo 998244353.
  return num_lucky_colorings % 998244353
```

The problem is that the modulo operation is applied to the product of `num_row_colorings` and `num_col_colorings`, which can be greater than 998244353. To fix this, we can use the following code:

```
def count_lucky_colorings(n):
  # Calculate the number of ways to color each row and column.
  num_row_colorings = 3 ** n
  num_col_colorings = 3 ** n

  # Calculate the number of lucky colorings.
  num_lucky_colorings = num_row_colorings * num_col_colorings

  # Return the number of lucky colorings modulo 998244353.
  return num_lucky_colorings % 998244353
```

2. **Incorrect use of the factorial function.** The factorial function, `math.factorial()`, can only be used to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
def count_lucky_colorings(n):
  # Calculate the number of ways to color each row and column.
  num_row_colorings = math.factorial(n)
  num_col_colorings = math.factorial(n)

  # Calculate the number of lucky colorings.
  num_lucky_colorings = num_row_colorings * num_col_colorings

  # Return the number of lucky colorings modulo 998244353.
  return num_lucky_colorings % 998244353
```

The problem is that the factorial of `n` is greater than 998244353 for `n` greater than or equal to 10. To fix this, we can use the following code:

```
def count_lucky_colorings(n):
  # Calculate the number of ways to color each row and column.
  num_row_colorings = math.factorial(n - 1)
  num_col_colorings = math.factorial(n - 1)

  # Calculate the number of lucky colorings.
  num_lucky_colorings = num_row_colorings * num_col_colorings

  # Return the number of lucky colorings modulo 998244353.
  return num_lucky_ colorings % 998244353
```

3. **Incorrect use of the binomial coefficient function.** The binomial coefficient function, `math.comb()`, can only be used to calculate the binomial coefficient of two non-negative integers. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
def count_lucky_colorings(n):
  # Calculate the number of ways to color each row and column.
  num_row_colorings = math.comb(n, n)
  num_col_colorings = math.comb(n, n)

  # Calculate the number of lucky colorings.
  num_lucky_colorings = num_row_colorings * num_col_colorings

  # Return the number of lucky colorings modulo 998244353.
  return num_lucky_colorings % 998244353
```

The problem is that the binomial coefficient of `n` and `n` is greater than 998244353 for `n` greater than or equal to 10. To fix this, we can use the following code:

```
def count_lucky_colorings(n):

7. **Incorrect output format:** The output should be a single integer, but the following code prints multiple integers:

```
print(M)
```

8. **Incorrect error handling:** The following code does not handle the error that occurs when the user enters a negative number for `N`:

```
try:
    N = int(input())
except ValueError:
    print('Invalid input')
```

9. **Unnecessary code:** The following code is unnecessary:

```
if N < 4:
    print('Invalid input')
```

10. **Inefficient code:** The following code is inefficient because it calculates the value of `M` for each stick in the matrix:

```
for i in range(N):
    for j in range(N):
        if i == j:
            M = M + 1
```

A more efficient way to calculate the value of `M` is to use the following formula:

```
M = N * (N + 1)
```

HACKEREARTH climbing-stairs-10

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one errors.** The most common bug is to forget to add 1 to the result. This can happen when you are computing a sum or a product, or when you are counting the number of elements in a list.
2. **Incorrect boundary conditions.** Make sure to check for the special cases at the beginning and end of your program. For example, if you are computing the factorial of a number, you need to handle the case where the number is 0 or 1.
3. **Incorrect data types.** Make sure that you are using the correct data types for your variables. For example, if you are computing the sum of a list of numbers, you need to make sure that all of the numbers in the list are of the same type.
4. **Logic errors.** Make sure that your program is doing what you think it is doing. This can be difficult to do, especially if your program is complex. One way to check for logic errors is to use a debugger.
5. **Runtime errors.** These are errors that occur when your program is running. They can be caused by a variety of problems, such as invalid input, memory errors, or segmentation faults. Runtime errors can be difficult to debug, but there are a number of tools available to help you.

HACKEREARTH execute-the-prisoners

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may forget to account for the fact that the prisoners are arranged in a circle, or they may not correctly calculate the number of prisoners who will be executed.
2. **Incorrect implementation**. The developer may make a mistake in the implementation of the program, which could lead to errors. For example, the developer may use the wrong data types, or they may not correctly handle edge cases.
3. **Runtime errors**. The developer may make a mistake that causes the program to run into runtime errors. For example, the developer may try to access a memory location that does not exist, or they may divide by zero.
4. **Logic errors**. The developer may make a mistake that causes the program to produce incorrect results. For example, the developer may use the wrong formula to calculate the answer, or they may not correctly account for all of the possible inputs.
5. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer may make a mistake that creates a security vulnerability in the program. For example, the developer may allow attackers to inject malicious code into the program, or they may not correctly protect the program's data.

HACKEREARTH highest-points

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The input is a list of integers, but the code is expecting a string. This can be fixed by changing the type of the input variable to `int`.
2. **Incorrect calculation:** The code is calculating the total number of points earned by a team, but the question is asking for the maximum number of points earned by a team. This can be fixed by using the `max()` function to find the largest value in the list.
3. **Off-by-one error:** The code is adding 1 to the number of wins, ties, and losses for each team. This is incorrect because the question is asking for the number of points earned, not the number of matches played. This can be fixed by removing the `+ 1` from the calculation.
4. **Incorrect indentation:** The code is not properly indented, which can make it difficult to read and understand. This can be fixed by indenting all of the code blocks correctly.
5. **Missing semicolons:** The code is missing semicolons at the end of some of the lines. This can cause errors when the code is run. This can be fixed by adding semicolons to the end of all of the lines.

Here is the correct code:
```
n = int(input())

points = []
for i in range(n):
    w, t, l = map(int, input().split())
    points.append(3 * w + t - l)

Title:
HACKEREARTH sherlock-and-xor

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input array can contain very large integers, so it's important to use the correct data type to store the elements. In this case, the integers should be stored as `long`s.

**2. Not using the XOR operator correctly**

The XOR operator returns the bitwise exclusive OR of two integers. This means that it returns a 1 if exactly one of the integers is a 1, and a 0 otherwise. In this problem, we need to find all pairs of integers in the array whose XOR is odd. To do this, we can use the following formula:

```
count = (n * (n - 1)) / 2
```

where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

**3. Not handling edge cases correctly**

The input array may contain one or more elements that are equal to 0. In this case, the XOR of any pair of elements will be 0, which is not odd. We need to handle this case by adding 1 to the count of odd pairs.

**4. Not using a fast algorithm**

The naive algorithm for solving this problem would iterate over all pairs of elements in the array and check if their XOR is odd. This algorithm would have a time complexity of O(n^2), which is too slow for large arrays.

A faster algorithm can be used by first sorting the array. This will allow us to find all pairs of elements whose XOR is odd in O(n) time.

**5. Not using a memory-efficient algorithm**

The naive algorithm for solving this problem would store all pairs of elements in the array in a hash table. This would require O(n^2) space.

A more memory-efficient algorithm can be used by only storing the first element of each pair of elements in a hash table. This would require O(n) space.

**6. Not using a correct solution**

The solution to this problem is not as straightforward as it might seem. The following is a correct solution:

```
def solve(A):
  n = len(A)
  count = 0

  # Sort the array.
  A.sort()

  # Iterate over all pairs of elements in the array.
  for i in range(n - 1):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
      # Check if the XOR of the two elements is odd.
      if (A[i] ^ A[j]) % 2 == 1:
        # Increment the count of odd pairs.
        count += 1

  # Return the number of odd pairs.
  return count

# Get the number of test cases.
T = int(input())

# Solve each test case.
for _ in range(T):
  # Get the number of elements in the array.
  n = int(input())

  # Get the elements in the array.
  A = list(map(int, input().split()))

  # Print the number of odd pairs.
  print(solve(A))

HACKEREARTH the-enlightened-ones

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable types**. The input is given as two integers, but the code may incorrectly parse them as strings. This could lead to errors when trying to perform mathematical operations on the values.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating over the list of temples, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one or more temples. This could lead to an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The algorithm for finding the minimum enlightenment value may be incorrect. This could lead to an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect output formatting**. The output should be a single integer, but the code may incorrectly print multiple values or a string. This could lead to the submission being rejected.
5. **Runtime errors**. The algorithm may take too long to run, or it may run out of memory. This could prevent the submission from being accepted.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the code for errors before submitting it. This can be done by running the code on a small test case and checking the output. It is also helpful to have someone else review the code to catch any errors that you may have missed.

Title:
HACKEREARTH xsquare-and-coin-collection-2

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect variable type**

The problem statement mentions that the number of stacks of coins is N, but the code defines N as an integer. This could lead to incorrect results if N is a large number.

**2. Incorrect variable initialization**

The code initializes the variable max_coins to 0. This means that the maximum number of coins that Xsquare can collect will always be 0, regardless of the input.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The code iterates through the stacks of coins, starting with the first stack. At each iteration, the code checks if the height of the current stack is less than or equal to K. If it is, the code adds the height of the current stack to the variable max_coins. Otherwise, the code skips the current stack and moves on to the next one.

This logic is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that Xsquare can collect coins from multiple stacks in one move. For example, if the first two stacks of coins have heights of 2 and 3, respectively, Xsquare could collect a total of 5 coins by collecting all of the coins from the first two stacks.

**4. Incorrect output**

The code prints the value of the variable max_coins, which is always 0. This is incorrect because the maximum number of coins that Xsquare can collect could be greater than 0.

**5. Inefficient algorithm**

The code iterates through the stacks of coins in a linear fashion. This means that the time complexity of the algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of stacks of coins. A more efficient algorithm would be to sort the stacks of coins by height and then iterate through the stacks in descending order. This would reduce the time complexity of the algorithm to O(N log N).

**1. Input Format**

The input is given in the following format:

```
N M
A_1 B_1 C_1
A_2 B_2 C_2
...
A_M B_M C_M
```

where:

* `N` is the number of boxes.
* `M` is the number of balls.
* `A_i` is the box where ball `i` is currently located.
* `B_i` is the box where ball `i` should be located.
* `C_i` is the maximum number of times that ball `i` can be moved.

**2. Output Format**

If the objective is achievable, print the minimum number of operations required to achieve it. Otherwise, print `-1`.

**3. Sample Input**

```
3 3
1 2 1
2 1 1
1 3 2
```

**4. Sample Output**

```
3
```

**5. Explanation**

We can move ball 1 from box 1 to box 2, then move ball 2 from box 2 to box 3, and finally move ball 3 from box 3 to box 1. This requires 3 operations in total.

**6. Possible Problems**

* The input may contain invalid values. For example, the number of boxes may be negative or the number of balls may be greater than the number of boxes.
* The input may not be formatted correctly. For example, the values in a line may be separated by a different character than a space.
* The input may contain duplicate values. For example, there may be two balls with the same ID.
* The input may contain incorrect values. For example, a ball may be assigned to a box that does not exist.
* The input may not be complete. For example, it may not contain all of the necessary information.

**7. Possible Bugs**

* The program may not handle invalid input correctly. For example, it may crash or produce incorrect output.
* The program may not handle correctly formatted input correctly. For example, it may not correctly parse the values in a line or it may not correctly handle duplicate values.
* The program may not handle incorrect values correctly. For example, it may not correctly handle a ball that is assigned to a box that does not exist.
* The program may not handle incomplete input correctly. For example, it may not correctly handle a line that does not contain all of the necessary information.

**8. How to Avoid These Problems**

* Use the `assert` statement to check for invalid values.
* Use the `re` module to parse the input data.
* Use the `set` data type to check for duplicate values.
* Use the `sys` module to check for incomplete input.

**9. Tips**

* Use a diagram to help you visualize the problem.
* Break the problem down into smaller steps.
* Test your code thoroughly.
* Use a debugger to help you find bugs.

Title:
ATCODER p02919 AtCoder Beginner Contest 140 - Second Sum

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of `sort()`.** The `sort()` function sorts the elements of a list in ascending order by default. If you want to sort the elements in descending order, you need to pass the `reverse` keyword argument to `sort()`.
2. **Incorrect use of `sum()`.** The `sum()` function returns the sum of the elements of a list. If you want to calculate the sum of the elements of a sublist, you need to use the `sum()` function with the `slice()` operator.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over a list, it is important to make sure that you start at the correct index and stop at the correct index. Otherwise, you may miss some elements or include some elements twice.
4. **Indexing errors.** When indexing into a list, it is important to make sure that the index is within the bounds of the list. Otherwise, you may get an error.
5. **Memory errors.** If you are not careful, you can easily run out of memory when working with large lists. To avoid this, it is important to use the `del` statement to delete elements from the list when you no longer need them.
6. **Infinite loops.** If you are not careful, you can easily create an infinite loop when iterating over a list. To avoid this, it is important to make sure that you break out of the loop when you reach the end of the list.
7. **Incorrect use of `enumerate()`.** The `enumerate()` function returns a tuple of the index and the element for each element in a list. If you are not careful, you may accidentally use the index instead of the element in your code.
8. **Incorrect use of `zip()`.** The `zip()` function takes two or more iterables and returns a tuple of pairs, where each pair consists of the corresponding element from each iterable. If you are not careful, you may accidentally use the wrong iterable in your code.

Title:
ATCODER p03055 AtCoder Grand Contest 033 - Removing Coins

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the game rules**

The most important thing to get right when solving this problem is to correctly implement the game rules. This means understanding how the game is played, and making sure that your code correctly implements each of the steps in the game.

**2. Using incorrect data structures**

Another common mistake is to use incorrect data structures to represent the tree. For example, if you use an adjacency list to represent the tree, you will need to make sure that you correctly handle the case where a vertex has multiple edges to the same other vertex.

**3. Not considering all possible cases**

When solving a problem like this, it is important to consider all possible cases. For example, you need to consider the case where the tree is a single vertex, and the case where the tree is a complete graph.

**4. Making off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that can occur when programming. When solving this problem, you need to be careful to make sure that you are not making any off-by-one errors, such as indexing into an array one element too high or low.

**5. Using incorrect math**

Another common mistake is to use incorrect math when solving a problem. For example, you need to make sure that you are correctly calculating the distance between two vertices in the tree.

**6. Not using efficient algorithms**

When solving a problem like this, it is important to use efficient algorithms. For example, you should use a BFS or DFS algorithm to find the shortest path between two vertices in the tree.

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a list of integers. If we use the wrong data type, such as a string, to store the input data, we will get a runtime error.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The problem is asking for the number of ways to write integers on the remaining squares so that the condition is satisfied. We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. However, if we use an incorrect algorithm, we will get an incorrect answer.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When we are doing calculations, we need to be careful about off-by-one errors. For example, if we are computing the sum of a list of numbers, we need to make sure that we start the index at 0, not 1.

**4. Undefined behavior**

We need to be careful about undefined behavior. For example, if we divide a number by zero, the behavior is undefined.

**5. Memory leaks**

We need to be careful about memory leaks. When we allocate memory, we need to make sure to free it when we are done with it. Otherwise, we will have a memory leak.

**6. Race conditions**

We need to be careful about race conditions when we are working with multiple threads. If two threads are trying to access the same data at the same time, it can lead to a race condition.

Title:
ATCODER p03346 AtCoder Grand Contest 024 - Backfront

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect algorithm**

A common mistake is to use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, a naive approach would be to iterate through the list of numbers, and for each number, move it to the front of the list if it is not already there. This algorithm would take O(N^2) time, which is not efficient.

**2. Incorrect data type**

Another common mistake is to use an incorrect data type to store the numbers in the list. For example, using a string to store the numbers would not be efficient, as strings are not designed for storing numerical data.

**3. Off-by-one error**

A common mistake is to make an off-by-one error when counting the number of operations required. For example, if the list of numbers is [1, 2, 3, 4], and the algorithm moves the number 2 to the front of the list, the algorithm would incorrectly count this as 2 operations, when it is actually only 1 operation.

**4. Incorrect boundary conditions**

Another common mistake is to not handle boundary conditions correctly. For example, if the list of numbers is empty, the algorithm should return 0, but a common mistake is to return 1.

**5. Runtime error**

A common mistake is to write code that will cause a runtime error. For example, if the algorithm tries to access an element of the list that does not exist, this will cause a runtime error.

**6. Memory leak**

A common mistake is to write code that leaks memory. For example, if the algorithm allocates memory for a temporary variable, but does not free it when it is no longer needed, this will cause a memory leak.

Title:
ATCODER p03506 Code Festival Team Relay (Parallel) - Evergrowing Tree

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data contains very large integers, so it is important to use the correct data types to avoid overflow errors. In particular, the indices of the vertices should be represented as `long long` integers.

**2. Using incorrect algorithms**

The problem can be solved using a simple depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. However, it is important to use the correct technique to avoid duplicate work. One way to do this is to use a hash table to store the vertices that have already been visited.

**3. Not handling all of the corner cases**

The problem statement specifies that the indices of the vertices are positive integers. However, it is possible that the input data contains negative integers or zero. In this case, the algorithm should return an error.

**4. Not testing the code thoroughly**

It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly for all possible inputs. This includes testing for all of the corner cases mentioned above.

Title:
ATCODER p03667 AtCoder Grand Contest 017 - Snuke and Spells

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the spellcasting algorithm**

The spellcasting algorithm should remove all balls with the current number of balls. However, a common mistake is to remove all balls with the same value as the current number of balls. This can lead to incorrect results, as it may be possible to cast the spell multiple times and remove more balls than necessary.

**2. Forgetting to update the number of balls after a spellcast**

After a spellcast, the number of balls changes. If this change is not updated, the spellcasting algorithm will not work correctly.

**3. Using an incorrect data structure to store the balls**

The balls can be stored in a variety of data structures, such as a list, a set, or a hash table. However, it is important to choose the correct data structure for the problem. For example, a list is not a good choice for this problem, as it would require O(N) time to find all balls with a given value. A set or a hash table would be a better choice, as they would allow for O(1) lookups.

**4. Using an incorrect algorithm to find all balls with a given value**

There are a variety of algorithms that can be used to find all balls with a given value. The most efficient algorithm is a binary search, which has a time complexity of O(log N). However, a linear search can also be used, which has a time complexity of O(N).

**5. Using an incorrect algorithm to count the number of balls**

The number of balls can be counted using a variety of algorithms. The most efficient algorithm is a linear scan, which has a time complexity of O(N). However, a binary search can also be used, which has a time complexity of O(log N).

Title:
ATCODER p03989 AtCoder Grand Contest 005 - ~K Perm Counting

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo**

When calculating the answer modulo 924844033, it is important to use the correct modulo. For example, if you accidentally use 1000000007 instead of 924844033, your answer will be incorrect.

**2. Not handling the edge cases correctly**

The problem statement specifies that N must be at least 2 and K must be at least 1. If you do not handle these edge cases correctly, your code will not work.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The problem can be solved using the following algorithm:

1. Calculate the number of permutations of length N that do not contain the integer K.
2. Calculate the number of permutations of length N that contain the integer K.
3. Subtract the second number from the first number to get the answer.

If you use an incorrect algorithm, your code will not work.

**4. Not using enough precision**

The answer to the problem can be very large. If you do not use enough precision, your code will not give the correct answer.

**5. Not using the right data types**

Title:
AIZU p00586 A + B Problem

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input is a series of pairs of integers, so the variables `A` and `B` should be of type `int`. If they are not, the sum of `A` and `B` will be incorrect.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The input is terminated by EOF, so the loop should check for `EOF` instead of `-1`. If the loop does not check for `EOF`, it will continue to iterate even after the input is exhausted, resulting in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The sum of `A` and `B` is calculated by `A + B`. If the operator is incorrect, the sum will be incorrect.
4. **Missing semicolon**. The end of each statement should be terminated with a semicolon. If a semicolon is missing, the compiler will generate an error.
5. **Undeclared variable**. The variables `A` and `B` must be declared before they can be used. If they are not declared, the compiler will generate an error.

Title:
AIZU p01425 White Bird

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect calculation of the trajectory of the white bird.** The white bird's trajectory is a parabola, but it is easy to make mistakes when calculating the equation of the parabola. For example, you might forget to take into account the acceleration due to gravity, or you might make a mistake in the coefficients of the equation.
2. **Incorrect collision detection.** When the white bird collides with an obstacle, it must be able to drop an egg bomb. However, it is easy to make mistakes when checking for collisions. For example, you might check for collisions only at the start and end of the white bird's trajectory, or you might not take into account the fact that the white bird's trajectory is curved.
3. **Incorrect handling of multiple obstacles.** The problem statement allows for multiple obstacles on the stage. However, it is easy to make mistakes when handling multiple obstacles. For example, you might only check for collisions with the closest obstacle, or you might not take into account the fact that the white bird can pass through some obstacles.
4. **Incorrect handling of the pig.** The problem statement states that the pig is located at the point (X, Y). However, it is easy to make mistakes when handling the pig. For example, you might forget to check if the pig is actually on the stage, or you might not take into account the fact that the pig can move.
5. **Incorrect output.** The problem statement requires you to output "Yes" if the white bird can drop an egg bomb toward the pig, and "No" otherwise. However, it is easy to make mistakes when outputting the answer. For example, you might forget to capitalize the first letter of "Yes" or "No", or you might output the wrong answer.

1. **Incorrect implementation of the LRU algorithm.** The LRU algorithm is a simple but effective caching algorithm that evicts the least recently used item from the cache when it is full. However, it is important to implement the algorithm correctly, as a bug in the implementation could lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect handling of cache misses.** When a cache miss occurs, the LRU algorithm must evict the least recently used item from the cache and add the new item. However, it is important to handle this case correctly, as a bug in the implementation could lead to incorrect results or even a deadlock.
3. **Incorrect handling of cache capacity.** The LRU algorithm works best when the cache is not full. However, it is important to handle the case when the cache is full correctly, as a bug in the implementation could lead to incorrect results or even a deadlock.
4. **Incorrect handling of concurrent accesses to the cache.** The LRU algorithm is designed to work with concurrent accesses to the cache. However, it is important to handle this case correctly, as a bug in the implementation could lead to incorrect results or even a deadlock.
5. **Incorrect handling of cache eviction.** The LRU algorithm evicts the least recently used item from the cache when it is full. However, it is important to handle this case correctly, as a bug in the implementation could lead to incorrect results or even a deadlock.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly parsing the input.** The input consists of two integers followed by a grid of characters. The integers represent the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively. The characters in the grid represent obstacles (% and \$) and the princess (@). The developer must correctly parse the input and store it in a data structure that can be easily manipulated.
2. **Incorrectly determining if the princess can reach the exit.** The princess can only move up, down, left, or right. She cannot move through obstacles. The developer must determine if there is a path from the princess to the exit that does not go through any obstacles.
3. **Incorrectly printing the output.** The output should be a single character, either "Yes" or "No". The developer must correctly print the output so that it is easy for the user to understand.
4. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the developer may incorrectly handle invalid input, or they may make a mistake in their algorithm for determining if the princess can reach the exit. It is important to carefully test the code to ensure that it is free of bugs.

Title:
AIZU p02301 Diameter of a Convex Polygon

Pain points:
**1. Input format**

The input format is not very clear. It is not clear how the points are represented. Are they represented as (x, y) tuples? Are they represented as strings? Are they represented as floating-point numbers? It is also not clear how the points are ordered. Are they ordered in clockwise order? Are they ordered in counterclockwise order?

**2. Floating-point arithmetic**

Floating-point arithmetic is notoriously difficult to get right. It is important to be aware of the following issues:

* Floating-point numbers are not exact. They are only approximate representations of real numbers. This can lead to rounding errors, which can cause problems in your code.
* Floating-point numbers are not ordered in a consistent way. For example, the following two floating-point numbers are not equal, even though they should be:

```
0.1 == 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625
```

This is because floating-point numbers are stored in a binary format, and the binary representation of 0.1 is not exactly equal to the binary representation of 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625.

* Floating-point numbers can be very large or very small. This can lead to overflow errors, which can cause your code to crash.

**3. Algorithm complexity**

The algorithm you use to solve this problem should have a polynomial time complexity. This means that the running time of the algorithm should be a polynomial function of the input size. For example, the following algorithms would not have a polynomial time complexity:

* A brute-force algorithm that tries every possible pair of points and computes the distance between them.
* An algorithm that sorts the points by their x-coordinates and then computes the distance between each pair of adjacent points.

**4. Data structures**

The data structures you use to solve this problem should be efficient. This means that they should use as little memory as possible and should allow you to perform operations quickly. For example, the following data structures would not be efficient:

* A list of all the points in the polygon.
* A hash table that maps each point to its distance from the origin.

**5. Error handling**

It is important to handle errors gracefully. This means that your code should not crash if it encounters an invalid input or if it runs into an unexpected problem. For example, your code should not crash if the input file does not exist or if the input format is invalid.

**6. Testing**

It is important to test your code thoroughly. This will help you to catch bugs and to ensure that your code is correct. You should test your code with a variety of different input files and with different types of input data.

Title:
AIZU p02448 Sorting Tuples

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for a variable.** For example, if you are trying to sort a list of numbers, but you accidentally use a string data type for one of the numbers, the sort will not work correctly.
2. **Not using the correct sorting algorithm.** There are many different sorting algorithms available, and the best one to use depends on the specific data set and the performance requirements. For example, if you need to sort a large data set quickly, you might want to use a sorting algorithm that is not as efficient as a more complex algorithm, but that uses less memory.
3. **Not handling duplicate values correctly.** If your data set contains duplicate values, you need to make sure that the sort algorithm handles them correctly. For example, you might want to sort the duplicate values in ascending or descending order, or you might want to ignore them completely.
4. **Not handling errors correctly.** If your sorting algorithm encounters an error, it is important to handle the error gracefully. For example, you might want to print an error message and then exit the program.
5. **Not testing your code.** It is important to test your sorting algorithm to make sure that it works correctly. You should test your code with different data sets, including data sets that contain duplicate values and data sets that are sorted in different orders.
