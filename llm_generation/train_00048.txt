CODECHEF arithm

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The variable `C` should be of type `long long`, not `int`.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator.** The condition `C >= N + 1` should be `C >= N + 2`.
3. **Off-by-one error.** The condition `C - N >= N` should be `C - N > N`.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The statement `if (C - N >= N)` should be `if (C - N > N)`.

Title:
CODECHEF clco03

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data is a string of digits. If we use an integer to store the input data, we will get a wrong answer. For example, if the input data is "123", the integer representation of it is 123, which is not what we want.

**2. Using incorrect formula**

The formula for calculating the factorial of a number is n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1. However, if we use this formula to calculate the factorial of a number that contains leading zeros, we will get a wrong answer. For example, if the input data is "006", the factorial of it is 6! = 720, which is not what we want.

**3. Using incorrect algorithm**

The correct algorithm for solving this problem is to first find the largest digit in the input data. Then, we need to find all the numbers that contain this digit and have the same factorial as the input data. The maximum number among these numbers is the answer.

**4. Not handling special cases**

We need to handle special cases such as the input data being empty or the input data containing only one digit.

Title:
CODECHEF fctrl2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect factorial calculation.** The most common mistake is to forget to multiply the current number by the previous factorials. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, not 5 * 4 * 3 * 2.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating factorials, it is easy to make a mistake and forget to add or subtract 1 from the number. For example, the factorial of 4 is 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, not 4! = 4 * 3 * 2.
3. **Incorrect use of recursion.** Recursion can be a powerful tool for calculating factorials, but it is important to use it correctly. For example, the following recursive function is incorrect:
```
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
```
This function will not work correctly because it will call itself infinitely when n is 0.
4. **Incorrect use of memoization.** Memoization can be a useful technique for speeding up factorial calculations, but it is important to use it correctly. For example, the following memoized function is incorrect:
```
def factorial(n):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    else:
        memo[n] = n * factorial(n - 1)
        return memo[n]
```
This function will not work correctly because it will overwrite the value of memo[n] every time it is called.
5. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.** When calculating factorials, it is important to use integers, not floating-point numbers. Floating-point numbers can be inaccurate, which can lead to incorrect results.
6. **Incorrect use of the factorial function.** The factorial function is a built-in function in many programming languages. However, it is important to use the factorial function correctly. For example, the following code is incorrect:
```
print(factorial(5))
```
This code will not work correctly because it is not using the factorial function correctly. The correct way to use the factorial function is to pass it a number as an argument. For example, the following code is correct:
```
print(math.factorial(5))
```

2. The output format is not clear. Is it T lines of T integers? Or T lines of T strings?
3. The problem statement is not clear. What does "one bottle of such substance he can use to single stem of bamboo" mean? Does it mean that we can use the substance on any stem? Or does it mean that we can only use the substance on one stem at a time?
4. The problem statement is not clear. What does "the height of i-th stem is decrased by 1 and the height of j-th stem is increased by 1 for each j not equal to i" mean? Does it mean that the height of i-th stem is decreased by 1 and the height of all other stems is increased by 1? Or does it mean that the height of i-th stem is decreased by 1 and the height of all other stems except for j is increased by 1?
5. The problem statement is not clear. What does "it's impossible" mean? Does it mean that there is no way to change the current plantation to the one that inspector Andrii requires? Or does it mean that there is no way to change the current plantation to the one that inspector Andrii requires without using any substance?
6. The problem statement is not clear. What does "the minimal number of bottles of substance required for changing current plantation to one that inspector wants" mean? Does it mean the minimum number of bottles of substance that we need to use to change the current plantation to the one that inspector Andrii requires? Or does it mean the minimum number of bottles of substance that we need to use to change the current plantation to the one that inspector Andrii requires without using any substance?

Title:
CODECHEF sub_perm

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the input strings.** The input strings can be very long, so it's important to use a data type that can store them without overflowing. For example, using a `char` array to store a string longer than `CHAR_MAX` will result in a buffer overflow.
2. **Not using a proper algorithm to find the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings.** The naive algorithm for finding the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings is to iterate over all possible substrings of the input string and check if each substring is a substring of the pattern string. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), where `n` is the length of the input string. There are more efficient algorithms that can be used, such as the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n).
3. **Not handling invalid input correctly.** The input strings may contain invalid characters, such as non-alphanumeric characters. It's important to handle invalid input gracefully, such as by skipping over invalid characters or by terminating the program with an error message.
4. **Not using a test suite to verify the correctness of your code.** It's important to write a test suite to verify the correctness of your code. This will help you catch bugs early and prevent them from causing problems in production.
5. **Not using version control to track changes to your code.** It's important to use version control to track changes to your code. This will help you to roll back changes if necessary and to collaborate with other developers on the same project.

CODEFORCES 1032_D. Barcelonian Distance

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly, and that you are not making any mistakes when parsing the input data. For example, if you accidentally read a character as a number, or if you misread a number, this could cause your program to crash or to output incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the distance**

The distance between two points can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. However, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct values for the x- and y-coordinates of the points. If you accidentally use the wrong values, this could cause your program to output incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect rounding of the distance**

The output for this problem must be rounded to an accuracy of 10^-6. This means that you need to make sure that you are rounding the distance to the correct number of decimal places. If you do not round the distance correctly, this could cause your program to output incorrect results.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

When calculating the distance between two points, it is important to make sure that you are not making any off-by-one errors. For example, if you accidentally add 1 to the x-coordinate of one of the points, this could cause your program to output incorrect results.

**5. Using the wrong data type**

It is important to make sure that you are using the correct data type for the input and output values. For example, if you are using an integer to store the distance between two points, this could cause your program to output incorrect results.

**6. Using floating-point arithmetic**

Floating-point arithmetic is not always accurate, so it is important to be careful when using it. For example, if you are using floating-point arithmetic to calculate the distance between two points, this could cause your program to output incorrect results.

**7. Using the wrong algorithm**

There are many different algorithms that can be used to calculate the distance between two points. It is important to make sure that you are using the correct algorithm for the problem you are trying to solve. If you use the wrong algorithm, this could cause your program to output incorrect results.

CODEFORCES 1077_C. Good Array

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a number of elements that is not between 2 and 2 * 10^5, or the elements may not be integers between 1 and 10^6.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may not contain a single integer on the first line, or the second line may not contain a list of integers separated by spaces.
* **Incorrect solution:** The solution may not correctly find all of the nice indices in the array. For example, the solution may not consider all possible removals of elements from the array, or it may incorrectly identify an element as nice when it is not.
* **Runtime error:** The solution may run out of time on a large input. For example, the solution may use a recursive algorithm that takes exponential time to run, or it may use a linear algorithm that takes quadratic time to run on a large input.
* **Memory error:** The solution may run out of memory on a large input. For example, the solution may create a large data structure that exceeds the amount of available memory, or it may repeatedly allocate and deallocate memory.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1145_G. AI Takeover

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrectly identifying the AI's strategy.** The AI's strategy may not be obvious, and it may be difficult to determine what it is based on the limited information that is given. If the developer incorrectly identifies the AI's strategy, they will not be able to develop a winning strategy.
* **Not using the stream flushing operation correctly.** The stream flushing operation is necessary to ensure that the output is not buffered and is sent to the AI immediately. If the developer does not use the stream flushing operation correctly, the AI may not receive the output and the developer will not be able to win the game.
* **Not winning enough rounds.** The developer must win at least 10 rounds in a row in order to win the game. If the developer does not win enough rounds, their solution will not be accepted.
* **Making other mistakes in the implementation.** The developer may make other mistakes in the implementation of their solution, such as using incorrect data types or making logical errors. These mistakes can prevent the developer from winning the game.

Here are some specific examples of problems that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer may incorrectly identify the AI's strategy as always picking rock, when in reality the AI's strategy is more complex. This could lead the developer to develop a strategy that is not effective against the AI's actual strategy.
* The developer may not use the stream flushing operation correctly, which could cause the AI to not receive the developer's output. This could lead to the developer losing the game.
* The developer may not win enough rounds in a row, which could cause their solution to be rejected. This could happen if the developer's strategy is not effective enough or if the developer makes mistakes in the implementation of their solution.
* The developer may make other mistakes in the implementation of their solution, such as using incorrect data types or making logical errors. These mistakes could prevent the developer from winning the game.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1166_F. Vicky's Delivery Service

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of integers. However, if the developer accidentally inputs a string, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect logic**

The developer may incorrectly implement the algorithm for finding a double rainbow. This can lead to the program returning an incorrect answer.

**3. Memory leak**

The developer may not properly free the memory allocated for the data structures used in the program. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

**4. Synchronization issues**

If the program is multi-threaded, the developer must take care to synchronize access to shared data structures. This can be done using locks or mutexes. Failure to do so can lead to data corruption and incorrect results.

**5. Race conditions**

A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data structure at the same time. This can lead to data corruption and incorrect results. The developer must take care to avoid race conditions by using locks or mutexes.

**6. Deadlocks**

A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely. The developer must take care to avoid deadlocks by using locks or mutexes in a deadlock-free manner.

**7. Buffer overflows**

A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes data to a buffer that is not large enough to hold the data. This can lead to the program crashing or executing arbitrary code. The developer must take care to ensure that buffers are large enough to hold the data that will be written to them.

**8. Integer overflows**

An integer overflow occurs when a program assigns a value to an integer that is larger than the maximum value that the integer can represent. This can lead to the program crashing or returning incorrect results. The developer must take care to ensure that integers are never assigned values that are too large.

**9. Off-by-one errors**

An off-by-one error occurs when a program misses or adds an element when iterating over a collection of data. This can lead to the program returning an incorrect result or crashing. The developer must take care to ensure that all elements of a collection are properly iterated over.

CODEFORCES 1204_A. BowWow and the Timetable

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a binary number without leading zeroes. A leading zero is a zero that appears at the beginning of a binary number. For example, `0101` is a binary number without leading zeroes, but `00101` is not.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single number.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of missed trains.** The number of missed trains is the number of powers of 4 that are less than or equal to the given number. For example, if the given number is 20, then the number of missed trains is 3 because 4^0 = 1, 4^1 = 4, and 4^2 = 16.
4. **Off-by-one error.** The number of missed trains may be off by one if the given number is a power of 4. For example, if the given number is 16, then the number of missed trains is 3, but it could be mistakenly calculated as 4.
5. **Runtime error.** The program may run out of time if it is not efficient enough.
6. **Memory error.** The program may run out of memory if it uses too much memory.
7. **Logic error.** The program may have a logic error if it does not correctly calculate the number of missed trains.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully check your input and output, and make sure that your calculation of the number of missed trains is correct. You should also make sure that your program is efficient and does not run out of time or memory.

CODEFORCES 1265_F. Beautiful Bracket Sequence (easy version)

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect implementation of the bracket sequence definition.** The definition of a correct bracket sequence is not as straightforward as it seems. For example, the string "())" is not a correct bracket sequence, even though it is balanced.
* **Incorrect implementation of the depth calculation algorithm.** The depth of a bracket sequence is not simply the number of open brackets minus the number of closed brackets. For example, the string "()()" has depth 2, even though it contains the same number of open and closed brackets.
* **Incorrect implementation of the modulo operation.** The modulo operation is not commutative, so it is important to perform it in the correct order. For example, the expression `(a + b) % m` is not equivalent to `(b + a) % m`.
* **Incorrect input handling.** The input string may contain invalid characters, such as spaces or newlines. It is important to check for these characters and handle them appropriately.
* **Incorrect output formatting.** The output should be formatted in a specific way, such as with a newline character at the end. It is important to make sure that the output is formatted correctly.

By following these guidelines, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

CODEFORCES 1307_B. Cow and Friend

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for x or a_i.** This can lead to incorrect results or runtime errors. For example, if x is a long integer and a_i is an integer, then the Euclidean distance between (0, 0) and (x, 0) will be rounded down to the nearest integer, which may not be one of a_i.
2. **Not handling the case where x is not a multiple of any of a_i.** In this case, Rabbit will need to make more than one hop. For example, if x is 4 and a_i is {1, 3}, then Rabbit will need to make two hops: (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (4, 0).
3. **Not using the most efficient algorithm.** The naive algorithm for solving this problem would be to iterate over all possible combinations of hops, and then find the combination that minimizes the number of hops. However, this algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is too slow for large values of n. A more efficient algorithm would be to use dynamic programming.
4. **Making a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm.** This could lead to incorrect results or runtime errors. For example, if you forget to update the state of the dynamic programming table after each iteration, then the algorithm will not produce the correct results.
5. **Not testing your code thoroughly.** This is important for catching any bugs that you may have missed. You should test your code with a variety of input values, including both valid and invalid inputs. You should also test your code with different data types and different values of n and x.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1393_A. Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy and Chess Coloring

Pain points:
1. The most important problem that a developer may encounter when solving this problem is the incorrect calculation of the minimum number of turns required to build a chess coloring pattern out of blocks on the grid. This can happen if the developer does not take into account the fact that each newly placed block must touch the built on the previous turns figure by a side.
2. Another possible problem is the incorrect implementation of the algorithm for finding the minimum number of turns. This can happen if the developer does not use an efficient algorithm, or if the algorithm is not implemented correctly.
3. Finally, the developer may also encounter problems with the input or output of the data. This can happen if the developer does not correctly parse the input data, or if the developer does not correctly format the output data.

Here are some tips to help avoid these problems:

1. Carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand all of the requirements.
2. Develop a clear and concise algorithm for finding the minimum number of turns.
3. Test your algorithm thoroughly with a variety of inputs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1485_D. Multiples and Power Differences

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data consists of integers. However, if you accidentally use a floating-point data type to store the input data, you will get incorrect results. For example, if you use `float` to store the input data, the following code will not work correctly:

```
n, m = map(float, input().split())
```

This is because `float` can represent numbers with fractional parts, while the input data only consists of integers. As a result, the code will not be able to correctly parse the input data.

**2. Using incorrect algorithms**

There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. However, not all of them are correct. For example, the following algorithm is incorrect:

```
def solve(n, m):
  # Initialize the output matrix.
  b = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]

  # Iterate over all cells in the input matrix.
  for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
      # Find the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to a[i, j].
      k = 1
      while k * k < a[i, j]:
        k *= 2

      # Set the corresponding cell in the output matrix to k^4.
      b[i][j] = k ** 4

  return b
```

This algorithm is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the absolute value of the difference between numbers in any adjacent pair of cells in the output matrix must be equal to k^4. As a result, the algorithm will not always produce the correct output.

**3. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

The input data may contain invalid values. For example, the input data may contain a negative number or a number that is greater than 10^6. If you do not handle these invalid values correctly, your code will not be able to handle all possible input cases.

**4. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it to Codeforces. This will help you to identify any bugs in your code and fix them before it is too late.

Here are some tips for testing your code:

* Use a variety of input data. This will help you to identify any bugs that are specific to certain input cases.
* Use a debugger to step through your code and watch how it behaves. This will help you to identify any bugs that are difficult to find with other testing methods.
* Ask other people to test your code. This will help you to identify any bugs that you may have missed.

By following these tips, you can help to ensure that your code is correct and that it will run successfully on Codeforces.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1535_F. String Distance

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect implementation of the sorting algorithm

The most common bug that a developer may encounter when solving this problem is an incorrect implementation of the sorting algorithm. This can lead to incorrect results, or even worse, a runtime error.

To avoid this bug, it is important to carefully read the documentation for the sorting algorithm you are using and make sure that you are using it correctly. It is also helpful to test your code on a few small examples before running it on your actual data.

### 2. Using an incorrect data structure

Another common bug that a developer may encounter when solving this problem is using an incorrect data structure. For example, if you are trying to sort a list of strings, you should not use a linked list. This is because linked lists are not sorted by default, and you would have to implement your own sorting algorithm.

Instead, you should use a data structure that is specifically designed for sorting, such as a binary search tree or a heap. This will ensure that your data is sorted correctly, and it will also make your code more efficient.

### 3. Using an incorrect time complexity

The time complexity of your solution is also important to consider. If your solution takes too long to run, it may not be able to solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time.

To avoid this problem, you should carefully analyze the time complexity of your solution and make sure that it is polynomial. This means that the time complexity should grow at a rate no faster than O(n^k), where n is the size of the input data and k is a constant.

### 4. Using an incorrect space complexity

The space complexity of your solution is also important to consider. If your solution uses too much memory, it may not be able to solve the problem on a machine with limited resources.

To avoid this problem, you should carefully analyze the space complexity of your solution and make sure that it is polynomial. This means that the space complexity should grow at a rate no faster than O(n^k), where n is the size of the input data and k is a constant.

### 5. Using an incorrect algorithm

Finally, the developer may also encounter a bug if they use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, if the problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm, the developer may try to use a brute-force algorithm instead. This will likely lead to incorrect results or a runtime error.

To avoid this problem, the developer should carefully analyze the problem and identify the most efficient algorithm for solving it. This may involve doing some research on the problem or consulting with a more experienced programmer.

CODEFORCES 162_I. Truncatable primes

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect algorithm to check if a number is prime.** A common mistake is to check if a number is divisible by 2, 3, and 5, and then assume that it is prime if it is not divisible by any of those numbers. However, this is not always the case, as there are many composite numbers that are not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. A more robust algorithm for checking if a number is prime is the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
2. **Not checking if the number contains any zeros.** A truncatable prime cannot contain any zeros, as the number 0 is not prime. This is a simple mistake to make, but it can be easily avoided by checking if the number contains any digits other than 0-9.
3. **Not checking if all of the suffixes of the number are prime.** A truncatable prime must have all of its suffixes as primes. This means that you need to check if the number is prime, and then check if all of the numbers formed by removing digits from the end of the number are also primes.
4. **Outputting the wrong answer.** This is the most obvious bug, but it is also the easiest to make. Make sure that you are outputting the correct answer, and that you are not using any incorrect characters or formatting.

Here are some tips for avoiding these bugs:

* Use a robust algorithm to check if a number is prime.
* Check if the number contains any zeros.
* Check if all of the suffixes of the number are prime.
* Double-check your work before submitting your answer.

CODEFORCES 182_E. Wooden Fence

Pain points:
**Possible problems**

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly parsed. For example, if the input contains a space between two numbers, it may be parsed incorrectly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correctly formatted. For example, if the output contains a newline character at the end, it may be interpreted incorrectly.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the answer**. The answer may be incorrect if the calculation is not done correctly. For example, if the answer is calculated using floating-point arithmetic, it may be incorrect due to rounding errors.
4. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic**. The modulo operator (%) is used to calculate the remainder of a division. If the answer is not a multiple of the modulo, it may be incorrect.
5. **Incorrect use of the bitwise operators**. The bitwise operators (<<, >>, &, |, ^, ~) are used to perform bitwise operations on integers. If the bitwise operators are used incorrectly, the answer may be incorrect.
6. **Incorrect use of the logical operators**. The logical operators (&&, ||, !, ^) are used to perform logical operations on boolean values. If the logical operators are used incorrectly, the answer may be incorrect.
7. **Incorrect use of the comparison operators**. The comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) are used to compare two values. If the comparison operators are used incorrectly, the answer may be incorrect.
8. **Incorrect use of the assignment operator**. The assignment operator (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. If the assignment operator is used incorrectly, the answer may be incorrect.
9. **Incorrect use of the increment and decrement operators**. The increment operator (++) and the decrement operator (--) are used to increment and decrement a variable by 1. If the increment and decrement operators are used incorrectly, the answer may be incorrect.
10. **Incorrect use of the conditional operator**. The conditional operator (? :) is used to evaluate a condition and return one of two values depending on the result of the condition. If the conditional operator is used incorrectly, the answer may be incorrect.

**Possible bugs**

1. **Off-by-one error**. An off-by-one error occurs when a calculation is done one index too high or low. For example, if a loop iterates over a list of numbers, an off-by-one error could occur if the loop starts at the wrong index or ends at the wrong index.
2. **Index out of bounds error**. An index out of bounds error occurs when a program tries to access an element of an array or list that does not exist. For example, if a program tries to access the element at index 10 of an array that only has 9 elements, an index out of bounds error will occur.
3. **Null pointer exception**. A null pointer exception occurs when a program tries to dereference a null pointer. A null pointer is a pointer that points to nothing, and dereferencing a null pointer will cause a program to crash.
4. **Arithmetic overflow error**. An arithmetic overflow error occurs when a calculation results in a number that is too large to be represented by the data type being used. For example, if a program tries to add two integers that are each larger than the maximum value that can be represented by an integer, an arithmetic overflow error will occur.
5. **Division by zero error**. A division by zero error occurs when a program tries to divide a number by zero. Dividing a number by zero is undefined, and will cause a program to crash.
6. **ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException**. An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs when a program tries to access an element of an array that is outside the bounds of the array. For example, if a program tries to access the element at index 10 of an array that only has 9 elements, an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException will occur.
7. **ClassCastException**. A ClassCastException occurs when a program tries to cast an object to a type that it is not compatible with. For example, if a program tries to cast a String object to an Integer object, a ClassCastException will occur.
8. **NullPointerException**. A NullPointerException occurs when a program tries to dereference a null reference. A null reference is a reference that points to nothing, and dereferencing a null reference will cause a program to crash.
9. **IllegalArgumentException**. An IllegalArgumentException occurs when a program passes an invalid argument to a method. For example, if a program passes a negative number to a method that expects a positive number, an IllegalArgumentException will occur.
10. **IllegalStateException**. An IllegalStateException occurs when a program is in

Pain points:
**Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs That a Developer May Encounter When Solving This Problem**

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading it in. For example, you might accidentally read in a number as a string, or you might miss a comma or newline. This could lead to your program crashing or producing incorrect output.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over a list of numbers, it's easy to make a mistake and skip over one of the numbers or count it twice. This could lead to your program missing a "bad" pair or counting a "good" pair as a "bad" pair.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic for finding the optimal order of problems is not trivial. It's easy to make a mistake and come up with an order that is not optimal. This could lead to your program producing incorrect output.
4. **Memory errors.** If you're not careful, your program could use up too much memory. This could cause your program to crash or run very slowly.
5. **Time errors.** If your program is too slow, it might not finish running before the time limit is reached. This could result in a TLE (time limit exceeded) error.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. **Be careful when reading in the input.** Make sure that you correctly parse the input format and that you don't miss any of the data.
2. **Use a debugger to check your logic.** A debugger can help you track down errors in your code. It can show you where your program is making mistakes and help you fix them.
3. **Use a memory profiler to check for memory leaks.** A memory profiler can help you find places in your code where memory is being allocated and not freed. This can help you avoid memory errors.
4. **Use a performance profiler to check for performance bottlenecks.** A performance profiler can help you identify parts of your code that are running slowly. This can help you optimize your code and improve its performance.

By following these tips, you can help avoid the most common problems and bugs that developers encounter when solving this problem.

CODEFORCES 230_A. Dragons

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values may not be correct, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input values are strings instead of integers, the program may crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may not consider all possible cases.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The program may make off-by-one errors, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may check the last element of the array one index too early or too late.
5. **Memory leaks**. The program may not properly release memory that it has allocated, which may lead to a memory leak. This can eventually cause the program to crash.
6. **Race conditions**. The program may not properly handle race conditions, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, two threads may try to access the same data at the same time, which can lead to corruption of the data.
7. **Deadlocks**. The program may deadlock, which means that it will stop responding and will not be able to continue execution. This can happen when two threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, but neither thread is willing to do so.
8. **Buffer overflows**. The program may overflow a buffer, which means that it will write data to a memory location that it is not supposed to write to. This can lead to security vulnerabilities.
9. **Format string vulnerabilities**. The program may use format strings incorrectly, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. For example, the program may allow a user to input a string that is used to format another string, which can lead to code execution.
10. **SQL injection vulnerabilities**. The program may not properly sanitize user input before using it in a SQL query, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. For example, the program may allow a user to input a string that is used in a SQL query, which can lead to unauthorized access to data.

CODEFORCES 279_E. Beautiful Decomposition

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format specifies that the first line should contain a string of 1s and 0s. However, if the input contains any other characters, the program will crash. For example, if the input contains the string "abc", the program will throw an error.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format specifies that the program should print a single integer. However, if the program prints anything else, it will be incorrect. For example, if the program prints the string "hello world", it will be incorrect.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not always find the optimal solution.

**4. Runtime error**

The program may run out of memory or time. This can happen if the program is too complex or if the input is too large.

**5. Logical error**

The program may contain a logical error. This can happen if the program is not written correctly. For example, the program may not check for errors in the input or it may not correctly update the state of the program.

**6. Security vulnerability**

Title:
CODEFORCES 301_D. Yaroslav and Divisors

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains two integers n and m, which are the number of elements in the array and the number of queries, respectively. If we use the wrong data type to store these two integers, such as `int`, we may get incorrect results. For example, if n = 1000000000 and m = 1000000000, then `int` can only store up to 2147483647, which is much smaller than n and m. As a result, we will get incorrect results.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the number of pairs of integers q, w (li ≤ q, w ≤ ri) such that pq is the divisor of pw. One possible solution is to use the following algorithm:

```
for (int i = li; i <= ri; i++) {
    for (int j = i; j <= ri; j++) {
        if (p[i] % p[j] == 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
}
```

However, this algorithm is not efficient because it takes O(n^2) time to run. A more efficient solution is to use the following algorithm:

```
for (int i = li; i <= ri; i++) {
    count += (ri - i + 1) / p[i];
}
```

This algorithm takes O(n) time to run, which is much more efficient than the previous algorithm.

**3. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

When we are writing code, it is important to check the boundary conditions carefully. For example, in the following code, we are using the following boundary condition:

```
if (p[i] % p[j] == 0) {
    count++;
}
```

This boundary condition is incorrect because it does not take into account the case where p[i] = 1. In this case, p[i] % p[j] will always be 0, even if p[j] is not a divisor of p[i]. As a result, we will get incorrect results.

**4. Not handling special cases**

When we are writing code, it is important to handle special cases. For example, in the following code, we are not handling the case where n = 0 or m = 0. In this case, the program will crash.

```
for (int i = li; i <= ri; i++) {
    for (int j = i; j <= ri; j++) {
        if (p[i] % p[j] == 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
}
```

**5. Not using the right data structures**

When we are writing code, it is important to use the right data structures. For example, in the following code, we are using an array to store the array p. However, this is not the right data structure to use because an array is not efficient for storing a large number of elements. A better data structure to use would be a hash table.

```
int p[n];
```
Test inputs:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

    count = 0
    for j in range(li, ri + 1):
        for k in range(j, ri + 1):
            if p[j] % p[k] == 0:
                count += 1
    print(count)
```

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

```
n = int(input())
m = int(input())
p = list(map(int, input().split()))
for i in range(m):
    li, ri = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for j in range(li, ri + 1):
        count += (ri - j + 1) / p[j]
    print(count)
```

**3. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

```
n = int(input())
m = int(input())
p = list(map(int, input().split()))
for i in range(m):
    li, ri = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    if p[i] == 1:
        count += (ri - i + 1)
    print(count)
```

**4. Not handling special cases**

```
n = int(input())
m = int(input())
p = list(map(int, input().split()))
for i in range(m):
    li, ri = map(int, input().split())

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be `t` (the number Sheldon wants to construct) and `sequence of digits`. The developer may forget to read the input correctly and get the wrong answer.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be the number of instances Sheldon can construct. The developer may forget to print the output or print the wrong answer.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may not understand the problem correctly and implement the wrong logic. For example, the developer may not realize that 6 and 9 are similar and can be used interchangeably.
4. **Incorrect error handling**. The developer may not handle errors correctly. For example, the developer may not handle the case where the input is invalid.
5. **Inefficient implementation**. The developer may implement the solution in an inefficient way. For example, the developer may use a brute-force approach to solve the problem.

5. **Incorrect use of memoization**. This problem can be solved very efficiently using memoization. However, it is very easy to make mistakes when implementing the memoization function. Make sure that you are using the memoization function correctly and that you are not accidentally recomputing values that have already been computed.
6. **Incorrect use of bitmasks**. This problem can also be solved very efficiently using bitmasks. However, it is very easy to make mistakes when using bitmasks. Make sure that you are using the bitmasks correctly and that you are not accidentally counting the same decompositions multiple times.

CODEFORCES 418_B. Cunning Gena

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is "1 2 3", the program will incorrectly parse the first integer as "1 2 3" and the second integer as "3". This will cause the program to output the incorrect answer "3".
2. **Incorrect logic:** The logic of the program may be incorrect, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may incorrectly calculate the minimum amount of money needed to solve all the problems. This could happen if the program does not take into account all of the constraints, such as the cost of a monitor or the number of problems that a friend can solve.
3. **Off-by-one errors:** Off-by-one errors can occur when the program does not correctly account for the size of an array or the number of elements in a list. For example, if the program is expecting an array of size 10, but the array is only initialized with 9 elements, an off-by-one error will occur. This could cause the program to crash or output incorrect results.
4. **Memory leaks:** Memory leaks can occur when the program does not properly free up memory that it has allocated. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing. For example, if the program creates a large array and does not free it up when it is finished with it, a memory leak will occur.
5. **Race conditions:** Race conditions can occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing. For example, if two threads are trying to update the same variable at the same time, a race condition could occur. This could cause the variable to be updated with incorrect data or the program to crash.
6. **Deadlocks:** Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can lead to the program being stuck in a state where it cannot progress. For example, if two threads are both trying to lock the same mutex, a deadlock could occur. This could cause the program to be stuck in a state where neither thread can continue.
7. **Buffer overflows:** Buffer overflows can occur when a program writes data to a buffer that is not large enough to hold the data. This can lead to the program crashing or executing unintended code. For example, if a program writes 100 bytes of data to a buffer that is only 50 bytes long, a buffer overflow will occur. This could cause the program to crash or execute unintended code.
8. **Format string vulnerabilities:** Format string vulnerabilities can occur when a program uses a format string that is not properly sanitized. This can lead to the program being tricked into executing unintended code. For example, if a program uses a format string like "%s%x", an attacker could provide a string that contains malicious code. This could cause the program to execute the malicious code, which could lead to a security breach.
9. **SQL injection vulnerabilities:** SQL injection vulnerabilities can occur when a program uses user input in an SQL query without properly sanitizing it. This can lead to the program being tricked into executing unintended SQL queries. For example, if a program uses user input in an SQL query like "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '%s'", an attacker could provide a username that contains malicious SQL code. This could cause the program to execute the malicious SQL code, which could lead to a security breach.
10. **Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities:** XSS vulnerabilities can occur when a program allows user input to be displayed in a web page without properly sanitizing it. This can lead to the program being tricked into executing unintended JavaScript code. For example, if a program allows user input to be displayed in a web page like "<script>alert('XSS')</script>", an attacker could provide input that contains malicious JavaScript code. This could cause the malicious JavaScript code to be executed in the browser of the user who is viewing the web page, which could lead to a security breach.
Test inputs:
**Incorrect input format:**

```
1 2 3
```

**Incorrect logic:**

```
n, m, b = map(int, input().split())
for i in range(n):
    x, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    if k > b:
        print(-1)
        break
    else:
        print(x)
```

This program will output the incorrect answer for the following input:

```
2 2 1
100 1 1
100 2 1
```

The correct answer is 202, but the program outputs 200. This is because the program does not take into account the fact that the second friend can only solve one problem, which means that Gena needs to buy two monitors to get the second friend to help him.

**Off-by-one errors:**

```
n, m, b = map(int, input().split())
friends = []
for i in range(n):
    x, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    friends.append((x, k, m))

monitors = 0
for friend in friends:
    if monitors + friend[1] >= b:
        print(monitors + friend[0])
        break
    else:
        monitors += friend[1]
```

This program will output the incorrect answer for the following input:

```
2 2 1
100 1 1
100 2 1
```

The correct answer is 202, but the program outputs 200. This is because the program does not take into account the fact that the second friend can only solve one problem, which means that Gena needs to buy two monitors to get the second friend to help him.

**Memory leaks:**

```
n, m, b = map(int, input().split())
friends = []
for i in range(n):
    x, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    friends.append((x, k, m))

monitors = 0
for friend in friends:
    if monitors + friend[1] >= b:
        print(monitors + friend[0])
        break
    else:
        monitors += friend[1]
```

This program will leak memory because the list `friends` is never cleared. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

**Race conditions:**

```
n, m, b = map(int, input().split())
friends = []
for i in range(n):
    x, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    friends.append((x, k, m))

monitors = 0
for friend in friends:
    if monitors + friend[1] >= b:
        print(monitors + friend[0])
        break
    else:
        monitors += friend[1]
```

This program is not thread-safe because it does not use any synchronization mechanisms. This can lead to race conditions, which can cause the program to output incorrect results or crash.

**Deadlocks:**

```
n, m, b = map(int, input().split())
friends = []
for i in range(n):
    x, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    friends.append((x, k, m))

monitors = 0
for friend in friends:
    if monitors + friend[1] >= b:
        print(monitors + friend[0])
        break
    else:
        monitors += friend[1]
```

This program can deadlock if there are two friends who can both solve the same problem. This is because the program will try to acquire both friends' locks simultaneously, which will cause the program to block and wait for one of the friends to release their lock. If neither friend ever releases their lock, the program will deadlock.

**Buffer overflows:**

```
n, m, b = map(int, input().split())
friends = []
for i in range(n):
    x, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    friends.append((x, k, m))

monitors = 0

CODEFORCES 727_D. T-shirts Distribution

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is very specific and must be followed exactly. Any deviation from the format will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is given as a string, but the program expects it to be an integer. This will cause the program to crash.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The program may incorrectly count the number of participants or the number of t-shirts of a particular size. This will cause the program to give an incorrect output.
4. **Logic error**. The program may not correctly check whether it is possible to distribute the t-shirts to all participants. This will cause the program to give an incorrect output.
5. **Runtime error**. The program may run out of memory or time. This will cause the program to crash.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input format. It is also important to test the program with a variety of input data to ensure that it is working correctly.
Test inputs:
1. Incorrect input format:

Title:
CODEFORCES 748_E. Santa Claus and Tangerines

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correctly parsed by the program. This can lead to errors in the logic of the program and incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The data type of the input values must be correctly specified. For example, if the input values are integers, but the program treats them as strings, this will lead to errors.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic of the program must be correct. For example, if the program divides a tangerine into two parts with the same number of slices, this will lead to an incorrect result.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are common in programming. For example, if the program iterates over a list of elements and misses one element, this will lead to an incorrect result.

**5. Memory leaks**

Memory leaks can occur when the program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

**6. Race conditions**

Race conditions can occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results or crashing.

**7. Deadlocks**

Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can lead to the program running indefinitely or crashing.

Title:
CODEFORCES 841_E. On the Bench

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is an array of integers, so the developer should use the `int` data type to store the elements of the array. Using a different data type, such as `char` or `string`, could lead to incorrect results.

**2. Using the wrong modulo operator**

The output should be a number modulo 109 + 7. The developer should use the `%` operator to perform modulo arithmetic. Using a different modulo operator, such as `//`, could lead to incorrect results.

**3. Using the wrong formula**

The formula for the number of right permutations is given in the problem statement. The developer should use this formula to calculate the output. Using a different formula could lead to incorrect results.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

The developer should be careful to avoid off-by-one errors when iterating over the array of integers. For example, the developer should check that `i < n` before accessing the element at index `i`.

**5. Incorrect variable initialization**

The developer should initialize all variables before using them. For example, the developer should initialize the variable `count` to 0 before using it to count the number of right permutations.

**6. Using uninitialized variables**

The developer should not use uninitialized variables. For example, the developer should not use the variable `product` before initializing it.

**7. Using incorrect data structures**

The developer should use the correct data structures to store the data. For example, the developer should use an array to store the elements of the array of integers.

**8. Using incorrect algorithms**

The developer should use the correct algorithms to solve the problem. For example, the developer should use a divide-and-conquer algorithm to solve this problem.

**9. Not handling special cases**

The developer should handle all special cases. For example, the developer should handle the case where the array of integers is empty.

CODEFORCES 888_D. Almost Identity Permutations

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specified in the problem statement is "The first line contains two integers n and k (4 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 4)." However, a developer may accidentally use a different input format, such as "The first line contains two integers n and k." This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of almost identity permutations.** The number of almost identity permutations can be calculated using the following formula:

```
N_k = (n! / (n - k)!)^k
```

However, a developer may accidentally make a mistake in this calculation, such as using the wrong factorial formula or forgetting to multiply by k. This would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over the indices of the permutation, a developer may accidentally miss one or more indices. This would cause the program to count fewer almost identity permutations than it should.
4. **Memory leaks.** The program may allocate memory that it does not free, leading to a memory leak. This can eventually cause the program to crash.
5. **Race conditions.** If the program is multi-threaded, it is possible for two threads to access the same data at the same time, which can lead to incorrect results.
6. **Deadlocks.** If the program is multi-threaded, it is possible for two threads to wait for each other to finish, which can cause the program to deadlock.
7. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program may be vulnerable to security attacks, such as buffer overflows or SQL injection.

Title:
CODEFORCES 911_B. Two Cakes

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains three integers, so the developer should use `int` to store them. However, if the developer uses a smaller data type, such as `short`, the program may produce incorrect results.

**2. Not checking for invalid input**

The input should contain three integers, and each integer should be a positive number. If the developer does not check for invalid input, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The problem statement states that Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that each plate contains at least one piece of cake. However, the developer's code may not satisfy this condition.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement does not specify what to do if `n` is less than 2. The developer's code should handle this edge case gracefully.

**5. Using inefficient algorithms**

The problem can be solved in O(n) time. However, the developer's code may use a slower algorithm, which will result in a slower runtime.
Test inputs:
1. **Using the wrong data type**

```

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input string may not be of the correct format. For example, it may not be a string of lowercase Latin letters, or it may not have even length.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer, the number of ways of partitioning the string modulo 109 + 7.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of ways**. The number of ways of partitioning the string can be calculated by using dynamic programming. However, it is important to make sure that the calculation is correct.
4. **Modulo arithmetic errors**. The number of ways of partitioning the string can be large, so it is important to perform modulo arithmetic correctly.
5. **Time complexity**. The time complexity of the algorithm should be polynomial in the length of the input string.
6. **Space complexity**. The space complexity of the algorithm should be polynomial in the length of the input string.

Title:
CODEFORCES 95_B. Lucky Numbers

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input is a positive integer, so we should use an integer data type to store it. If we use a floating-point data type, it may cause problems when comparing the input with the output. For example, if the input is 4500 and the output is 4747, the floating-point comparison will return `False` because 4500.0 is not equal to 4747.0.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the least super lucky number that is more than or equal to n. A naive algorithm would be to start from n and increment it until we find a super lucky number. This algorithm would work, but it would be very inefficient. A better algorithm would be to use a binary search.

**3. Not handling invalid inputs**

The input may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or non-integers. We should check the input for validity and return an error message if it is invalid.

**4. Not handling overflow**

The output may be a very large number. We should make sure that the output can be represented by the data type we are using.

**5. Not using the right libraries**

There are many libraries available that can help us solve this problem. For example, the `math` library contains functions that can help us find the least common multiple of two numbers. We should use these libraries to make our code more efficient.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may contain a string instead of a number.
3. **Incorrect solution**. The solution does not correctly solve the problem. For example, the solution may return the wrong answer for some input.
4. **Time limit exceeded**. The solution takes too long to run on the judge's machine.
5. **Memory limit exceeded**. The solution uses too much memory on the judge's machine.
6. **Runtime error**. The solution crashes or produces an error on the judge's machine.
7. **Compilation error**. The solution cannot be compiled by the judge's compiler.
8. **Presentation error**. The solution's output is not formatted correctly. For example, the solution may not print the output on a single line or may not use the correct capitalization.

1. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, resulting in the wrong answer. For example, the program may not correctly account for all of the possible cases.
2. **Incorrect implementation**. The program may be implemented incorrectly, resulting in errors or unexpected behavior. For example, the program may use incorrect data types or make invalid assumptions about the input.
3. **Runtime errors**. The program may run into runtime errors, such as segmentation faults or out-of-memory errors. These errors can occur for a variety of reasons, such as incorrect logic, incorrect implementation, or invalid input.
4. **Syntax errors**. The program may contain syntax errors, which are errors in the code that prevent it from compiling or running correctly. These errors can be caused by a variety of factors, such as incorrect punctuation, missing or incorrect keywords, or invalid variable names.
5. **Logic errors**. The program may contain logic errors, which are errors in the code that cause it to produce incorrect results. These errors can be caused by a variety of factors, such as incorrect assumptions about the input, incorrect calculations, or incorrect data structures.

HACKEREARTH dawood-the-mathematician

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of modulo operator**. The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 returns 1. This means that 10 divided by 3 has a remainder of 1. However, some developers mistakenly use the modulo operator to check if a number is divisible by another number. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
if (n % m == 0) {
  // n is divisible by m
}
```

This is because the modulo operator will return 0 even if n is not divisible by m. To check if n is divisible by m, you should use the following code:

```
if (n / m == Math.floor(n / m)) {
  // n is divisible by m
}
```

2. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a developer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

This code will only print the numbers 0 to 9, because the loop condition is `i < 10`, not `i <= 10`. To fix this bug, you can change the loop condition to `i <= 10`.

3. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers**. Floating-point numbers are a type of number that can represent both positive and negative numbers, as well as decimals. However, floating-point numbers are not always precise, and this can lead to errors in your code. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
var x = 0.1 + 0.2;
console.log(x);
```

This code will print the value `0.30000000000000004`, not `0.3`. This is because the floating-point number `0.1` is not exactly equal to `1 / 10`, and the floating-point number `0.2` is not exactly equal to `2 / 10`. To avoid this problem, you should use the `Math.round()` function to round floating-point numbers to the nearest integer.

4. **Incorrect use of the `Math.pow()` function**. The `Math.pow()` function returns the value of a number raised to a power. For example, the following code will print the value `81`:

```
console.log(Math.pow(9, 2));
```

However, the `Math.pow()` function can also be used incorrectly. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
var x = 10;
var y = Math.pow(x, 2);
console.log(y);
```

This code will print the value `1000000000000000000`, which is not correct. This is because the `Math.pow()` function uses double-precision floating-point numbers, which can only represent a limited range of values. To avoid this problem, you should use the `Math.floor()` function to round the result of the `Math.pow()` function to the nearest integer.

5. **Incorrect use of the `Math.sqrt()` function**. The `Math.sqrt()` function returns the square root of a number. For example, the following code will print the value `3`:

```
console.log(Math.sqrt(9));
```

However, the `Math.sqrt()` function can also be used incorrectly. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
var x = -9;
var y = Math.sqrt(x);
console.log(y);
```

This code will throw an error, because the square root of a negative number is not a real number. To avoid this problem, you should check if the number is negative before calling the `Math.sqrt()` function.

6. **Incorrect use of the `Math.min()` and `Math.max()` functions**. The `Math.min()` function returns the smallest of two numbers, and the `Math.max()` function returns the largest of two numbers. For example, the following code will print the value `1`:

```
console.log(Math.min(2, 1));
```

However, the `Math.min()` and `Math.max()`

Title:
HACKEREARTH karan-and-strings

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of string functions.** For example, using `str.replace()` to replace all occurrences of a character in a string will replace all occurrences of that character, even if they are not consecutive. To only replace consecutive occurrences of a character, you can use a regular expression with the `+` character.
2. **Incorrect use of slicing.** Slicing a string will return a new string that contains the specified characters from the original string. However, if you try to slice a string that does not exist, you will get an error. Be sure to check the length of the string before slicing it.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over a string, it is easy to make an off-by-one error and miss a character or include an extra character. Be careful to check the indices of your loop variables to make sure that you are iterating over the correct characters.
4. **Incorrect handling of empty strings.** A string with no characters is called an empty string. When working with empty strings, it is important to be aware of the special cases that apply to them. For example, the empty string is not equal to any other string, including itself.
5. **Inefficient algorithms.** There are many different ways to solve this problem, but some algorithms are more efficient than others. Be sure to choose an algorithm that is appropriate for the size of the input data.

The input format is not clear. It is not clear what the input should be and what the output should be. For example, it is not clear whether the first line of the input should contain the number of test cases or the number of houses and roads.

**2. The problem statement is not clear.**

The problem statement is not clear. It is not clear what the goal of the problem is. For example, it is not clear what Mittal wants to do and why he is only allowed to go out for K units of time.

**3. The solution is not efficient.**

The solution is not efficient. It takes O(N^2) time to find the shortest path from house 1 to house A, which is not good enough for large values of N.

**4. The solution is not correct.**

The solution is not correct. It does not work for all test cases. For example, it does not work for the test case where N = 5, M = 5, K = 20, A = 4, and the roads are (1, 2, 2), (2, 3, 4), (3, 4, 5), (4, 5, 1), and (1, 4, 7). In this case, the correct answer is 6, but the solution returns 5.

Title:
HACKEREARTH panda-and-combination

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem states that the first line will contain T, the number of test cases. However, if the input format is incorrect, such as if the first line does not contain a single integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem states that for each test case, the output should be the minimum number of such numbers (powers of M) which can be summed up to produce N. However, if the output format is incorrect, such as if the output does not contain a single integer, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of powers**. The minimum number of powers of M that can be summed up to produce N is equal to the floor of the logarithm of N to the base M. However, if the calculation of the minimum number of powers is incorrect, such as if the logarithm is calculated incorrectly, the program will output an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect handling of overflow**. The problem states that N and M can be as large as 10^14. However, if the program does not handle overflow correctly, such as if the integer type is not large enough to store N or M, the program will crash.
5. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers**. The problem states that N and M can be as large as 10^14. However, if the program uses floating-point numbers to store N or M, the program may produce incorrect results due to rounding errors.
6. **Incorrect use of recursion**. The problem can be solved recursively by using the following algorithm:

```
def find_min_powers(N, M):
  if N == 0:
    return 0
  else:
    return 1 + find_min_powers(N - M, M)
```

However, if the recursion is not implemented correctly, such as if the base case is not handled correctly, the program will crash.
7. **Incorrect use of dynamic programming**. The problem can also be solved using dynamic programming by using the following algorithm:

```
def find_min_powers(N, M):
  dp = [[0 for i in range(N + 1)] for j in range(M + 1)]
  for i in range(M + 1):
    dp[i][0] = 0
  for j in range(N + 1):
    dp[0][j] = j
  for i in range(1, M + 1):
    for j in range(1, N + 1):
      dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - i] + 1)
  return dp[M][N]
```

However, if the dynamic programming table is not initialized correctly, such as if the table is not large enough to store all of the values, the program will crash.
8. **Incorrect use of memoization**. The problem can also be solved using memoization by using the following algorithm:

```
def find_min_powers(N, M):
  memo = {}
  def _find_min_powers(N, M):
    if N == 0:
      return 0
    if (N, M) in memo:
      return memo[(N, M)]
    memo[(N, M)] = 1 + _find_min_powers(N - M, M)
    return memo[(N, M)]
  return _find_min_powers(N, M)
```

However, if the memoization table is not initialized correctly, such as if the table is not large enough to store all of the values, the program will crash.

HACKEREARTH rod-cutting-problem-7

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not specified.** The problem statement mentions that the input is a single integer `N`, but the sample input contains two lines. It is not clear if the first line is the number of test cases or the first test case.
2. The output format is not specified. The problem statement mentions that the output should be a single integer, but the sample output contains two lines. It is not clear if the first line is the number of special rods or the first special rod.
3. The problem statement does not define what a "special rod" is. It is not clear if a special rod is a rod that requires Step 2 in every step of its cutting, or if it is a rod that requires Step 2 in at least one step of its cutting.
4. The problem statement does not define what "the difference between the lengths of the two pieces" is. It is not clear if the difference is the absolute value of the difference, or if it is the signed value of the difference.
5. The problem statement does not define what "the currently chosen piece" is. It is not clear if the currently chosen piece is the rod that is being cut, or if it is the rod that was cut in the previous step.
6. The problem statement does not define what "the algorithm stops" means. It is not clear if the algorithm stops when the length of the rod becomes 1, or if it stops when the difference between the lengths of the two pieces becomes 0.
7. The problem statement does not define what "there is no such rod" means. It is not clear if this means that there is no rod in the given range, or if there is no rod that meets the definition of a "special rod".

ATCODER p02586 AtCoder Beginner Contest 175 - Picking Goods

Pain points:
**1. Mismatch between input and output format**

The input format is given as follows:

```
R C K
r_1 c_1 v_1
r_2 c_2 v_2
:
r_K c_K v_K
```

However, the output format is given as follows:

```
Maximum possible sum of the values of items Takahashi picks up.
```

This mismatch can lead to the program not outputting the correct answer.

**2. Incorrect use of variables**

The variables used in the program must be used correctly. For example, the variable `R` should be used to store the number of rows, and the variable `C` should be used to store the number of columns. If these variables are used incorrectly, the program may not produce the correct output.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors can occur when the programmer accidentally skips or repeats a line of code. This can lead to the program not working correctly. For example, if the programmer forgets to add a line of code to increment the variable `i`, the program may not iterate through the entire list of items.

**4. Incorrect logic**

The logic used in the program must be correct. For example, the program must correctly calculate the maximum possible sum of the values of items Takahashi picks up. If the logic is incorrect, the program may not produce the correct output.

**5. Runtime errors**

Runtime errors can occur when the program runs into an unexpected problem. For example, the program may run out of memory or try to access a nonexistent file. Runtime errors can prevent the program from running correctly or from producing the correct output.

**6. Logical errors**

Logical errors can occur when the program does not behave as expected. For example, the program may crash or produce incorrect output. Logical errors can be difficult to find and fix.

ATCODER p02717 AtCoder Beginner Contest 161 - ABC Swap

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The problem states that the input is three integers, but the code below assumes that the input is a string. This will cause the code to fail when the input is not a valid integer.
2. **Incorrect variable names:** The code below uses the variable names `a`, `b`, and `c` to store the values of the boxes A, B, and C, respectively. This is confusing, as the variable names do not match the names of the boxes in the problem statement.
3. **Incorrect logic:** The code below does not correctly swap the contents of the boxes A and B. It first swaps the values of `a` and `b`, then swaps the values of `a` and `c`. This results in the values of `a` and `b` being swapped twice, which is not what the problem statement requires.
4. **Missing error handling:** The code below does not handle errors that may occur when reading the input. For example, if the input is not a valid integer, the code will crash.
5. **Unnecessary code:** The code below includes unnecessary code that does not contribute to the solution. For example, the line `print(a, b, c)` prints the values of the boxes A, B, and C, even though this information is already printed by the `print()` function in the `main()` function.

To avoid these problems, the following steps can be taken:

1. Use the correct variable type for the input.
2. Use descriptive variable names that match the names of the boxes in the problem statement.
3. Correctly implement the logic for swapping the contents of the boxes A and B.
4. Add error handling to the code to catch errors that may occur when reading the input.
5. Remove unnecessary code from the code.

Title:
ATCODER p02846 Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Programming Contest 2019 - Interval Running

Pain points:
**1. Incorrectly calculating the number of times Takahashi and Aoki meet**

One common mistake is to incorrectly calculate the number of times Takahashi and Aoki meet. The following is an example of incorrect code:

```
def solve():
    T1, T2 = map(int, input().split())
    A1, A2 = map(int, input().split())
    B1, B2 = map(int, input().split())

    # Calculate the number of times Takahashi and Aoki meet
    meet_count = 0
    for t in range(1, 10**18):
        if (t % T1 == 0 and t % T2 == 0) or (t % T1 == T2 - 1 and t % T2 == T1 - 1):
            meet_count += 1

    return meet_count


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(solve())
```

This code incorrectly calculates the number of times Takahashi and Aoki meet because it does not take into account the fact that Takahashi and Aoki may meet at the same time. To correctly calculate the number of times Takahashi and Aoki meet, we need to add the following code to the above code:

```
    if (t % T1 == 0 and t % T2 == 0):
        meet_count += 1
    elif (t % T1 == T2 - 1 and t % T2 == T1 - 1):
        meet_count += 1
```

**2. Using incorrect data types**

Another common mistake is to use incorrect data types. For example, the following code incorrectly uses the `int` data type to store the values of `T1`, `T2`, `A1`, `A2`, `B1`, and `B2`:

```
def solve():
    T1, T2 = map(int, input().split())
    A1, A2 = map(int, input().split())
    B1, B2 = map(int, input().split())

    # Calculate the number of times Takahashi and Aoki meet
    meet_count = 0
    for t in range(1, 10**18):
        if (t % T1 == 0 and t % T2 == 0) or (t % T1 == T2 - 1 and t % T2 == T1 - 1):
            meet_count += 1

    return meet_count


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(solve())
```

This code will cause an error because the values of `T1`, `T2`, `A1`, `A2`, `B1`, and `B2` may be too large to be stored in the `int` data type. To correctly solve the problem, we need to use the `long` data type to store these values.

**3. Using incorrect mathematical operations**

Another common mistake is to use incorrect mathematical operations. For example, the following code incorrectly uses the `%` operator to calculate the remainder of `t` divided by `T1`:

```
def solve():
    T1, T2 = map(int, input().split())
    A1, A2 = map(int, input().split())
    B1, B2 = map(int, input().split())

    # Calculate the number of times Takahashi and Aoki meet
    meet_count = 0
    for t in range(1, 10**18):
        if (t % T1 == 0 and t % T2 == 0) or (t % T1 == T2 - 1 and t % T2 == T1 - 1):
            meet_count += 1

    return meet_count


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(solve())
```

This code will cause an error because the value of `t` may be greater than `T1`. To correctly calculate the remainder of `t` divided by `T1`, we need to use the following code:

```
if t % T1 == 0:
    meet_count += 1
```
Test inputs:
**1. Incorrectly calculating the number of times Takahashi and Aoki meet**

```

# Calculate the number of times Takahashi and Aoki meet
meet_count = 0
for t in range(1, 10**18):
    if (t % T1 == 0 and t % T2 == 0) or (t % T1 == T2 - 1 and t % T2 == T1 - 1):
        meet_count += 1

print(meet_count)
```

**2. Using incorrect data types**

```

for t in range(1, 10**18):
    if (t % T1 == 0 and t % T2 == 0) or (t % T1 == T2 - 1 and t % T2 == T1 - 1):
        meet_count += 1

```

Title:
ATCODER p02983 AtCoder Beginner Contest 133 - Remainder Minimization 2019

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**

The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. For example, 10 % 3 = 1, because 10 / 3 has a remainder of 1. However, in this problem, we need to find the smallest possible value of (i * j) mod 2019. This means that we need to find the smallest possible value of i * j that is evenly divisible by 2019.

To do this, we can first find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of L and R. The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both numbers evenly. In this case, the GCD of L and R is 2019.

Once we have the GCD, we can divide both L and R by the GCD. This will give us two new numbers, l and r, such that L = l * GCD and R = r * GCD.

Now, we can simply multiply l and r together to get the smallest possible value of (i * j) mod 2019.

```
def main():
    # Get the input.
    L, R = map(int, input().split())

    # Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of L and R.
    gcd = math.gcd(L, R)

    # Divide both L and R by the GCD.
    l = L // gcd
    r = R // gcd

    # Multiply l and r together to get the smallest possible value of (i * j) mod 2019.
    print((l * r) % 2019)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**2. Using the wrong data type**

The input for this problem is two non-negative integers. However, the modulo operator (%) only works with integers. If you try to use the modulo operator with a floating-point number, you will get an error.

To avoid this problem, you should cast the input to an integer before using the modulo operator.

```
def main():
    # Get the input.
    L, R = map(int, input().split())

    # Cast the input to an integer.
    L = int(L)
    R = int(R)

    # Find the smallest possible value of (i * j) mod 2019.
    print((L * R) % 2019)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**3. Not handling negative numbers correctly**

The input for this problem can be negative. However, the modulo operator (%) only works with positive numbers. If you try to use the modulo operator with a negative number, you will get an error.

To avoid this problem, you should check if the input is negative and, if it is, you should convert it to a positive number before using the modulo operator.

```
def main():
    # Get the input.
    L, R = map(int, input().split())

    # Check if the input is negative.
    if L < 0:
        L = -L
    if R < 0:
        R = -R

    # Find the smallest possible value of (i * j) mod 2019.
    print((L * R) % 2019)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**4. Not handling overflows correctly**

The modulo operator (%) can cause overflows if the operands are too large. To avoid this problem, you should check if the operands are too large and, if they are, you should reduce them to a smaller size before using the modulo operator.

```
def main():
    # Get the input.
    L, R = map(int, input().split())

    # Check if the operands are too large.
    if L > 2 ** 31 - 1 or R > 2 ** 31 - 1:
        L = L % (2 ** 31 - 1)
        R = R % (2 ** 31 - 1)

    # Find the smallest possible value of (i * j) mod 2019.
    print((L * R) % 2019)

Title:
ATCODER p03125 AtCoder Beginner Contest 118 - B +/- A

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input consists of two positive integers, so the developer should use `int` or `long` to store them. Using a smaller data type, such as `short`, could lead to incorrect results.

**2. Dividing by zero**

The problem states that `A` is a divisor of `B`, so it is possible that `B` is divisible by `A` with no remainder. In this case, the developer should divide `B` by `A` and add `A` to the result. However, if `B` is not divisible by `A`, the developer will get a `ZeroDivisionError`. To avoid this, the developer should check if `B` is divisible by `A` before dividing them.

**3. Using the wrong operator**

The problem states that the developer should print `A + B` if `A` is a divisor of `B` and `B - A` otherwise. However, the developer might accidentally use the wrong operator, such as `+` instead of `-`. This would lead to incorrect results.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

When checking if `A` is a divisor of `B`, the developer might accidentally check if `A` is less than or equal to `B` instead of less than `B`. This would lead to incorrect results.

**5. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The developer might use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the developer might try to find the greatest common divisor of `A` and `B` and then divide `B` by the greatest common divisor. However, this algorithm would not work if `A` is not a divisor of `B`.

**6. Not handling all possible cases**

The developer should make sure to handle all possible cases, such as when `A` is equal to `B` or when `A` is greater than `B`. Not handling all possible cases could lead to incorrect results.

ATCODER p03267 AtCoder Beginner Contest 108 - All Your Paths are Different Lengths

Pain points:
**Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs That a Developer May Encounter When Solving This Problem**

* **Incorrect Input Handling**

The input format for this problem is not very straightforward, and it is easy to make mistakes when reading in the data. For example, if you forget to read in the number of vertices, you will get an incorrect answer.

* **Incorrect Graph Construction**

The graph construction process is also quite complex, and it is easy to make mistakes. For example, if you forget to add an edge from vertex 1 to vertex N, you will get an incorrect answer.

* **Incorrect Path Length Calculation**

The path length calculation process is also quite complex, and it is easy to make mistakes. For example, if you forget to add the length of the first edge to the path length, you will get an incorrect answer.

* **Incorrect Output Formatting**

The output format for this problem is also not very straightforward, and it is easy to make mistakes when formatting the output. For example, if you forget to put a space between the vertices and the edge lengths, you will get an incorrect output.

* **Other Errors**

There are a number of other errors that a developer may encounter when solving this problem, such as:

* Using the wrong data type for a variable
* Forgetting to initialize a variable
* Using an incorrect algorithm
* Making a logical error

By carefully reading the problem statement and following the instructions, you can avoid these common errors and solve the problem correctly.

Title:
ATCODER p03425 AtCoder Beginner Contest 089 - March

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input specifies that `N` can be up to `10^5`, so the answer could be as large as `10^15`. However, `int` is a signed 32-bit integer type, which has a maximum value of `2^31 - 1`. This means that if the answer is larger than `2^31 - 1`, the program will overflow and give an incorrect answer.

To avoid this problem, we can use a `long long` integer type, which is a signed 64-bit integer type. This has a maximum value of `2^63 - 1`, which is much larger than the maximum possible answer.

**2. Not handling the case where there are no people whose names begin with `M`, `A`, `R`, `C` or `H`**

The problem states that we need to choose three people whose names begin with `M`, `A`, `R`, `C` or `H`. However, it is possible that there are no people whose names begin with any of these letters. In this case, the answer is 0.

We can check if there are any people whose names begin with `M`, `A`, `R`, `C` or `H` by iterating through the list of names and checking if each name starts with one of these letters. If there are no names that start with any of these letters, we can set the answer to 0.

**3. Not handling the case where there are multiple people whose names begin with the same letter**

The problem states that there cannot be multiple people whose names begin with the same letter. However, it is possible that there are multiple people whose names begin with the same letter. In this case, the answer is 0.

We can check if there are multiple people whose names begin with the same letter by iterating through the list of names and keeping track of the number of times each letter appears. If any letter appears more than twice, we can set the answer to 0.

**4. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a simple brute-force algorithm. However, this algorithm is not very efficient. A more efficient algorithm would be to use dynamic programming.

Dynamic programming is a technique that can be used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems. In this case, we can break the problem down into the following subproblems:

* The number of ways to choose three people whose names begin with `M`.
* The number of ways to choose three people whose names begin with `A`.
* The number of ways to choose three people whose names begin with `R`.
* The number of ways to choose three people whose names begin with `C`.
* The number of ways to choose three people whose names begin with `H`.

Once we have solved each of these subproblems, we can find the answer to the original problem by adding the solutions to the subproblems together.

The following is an implementation of the dynamic programming algorithm for solving this problem:

```
def solve(n):
  # Initialize the table to 0.
  table = [[0] * 6 for _ in range(n + 1)]

  # Fill in the first row of the table.
  for i in range(6):
    table[0][i] = 1

  # Iterate through the rows of the table.
  for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # Iterate through the columns of the table.
    for j in range(6):
      # If the current letter is the same as the previous letter, add the value of the previous cell to the current cell.
      if j == (i - 1) % 6:
        table[i][j] += table[i - 1][j]
      # Otherwise, add the values of the two cells to the left and below the current cell to the current cell.
      else:
        table[i][j] += table[i - 1][j - 1] + table[i - 1][j + 1]

  # Return the value of the last cell in the table.
  return table[n][0]

ATCODER p03582 CODE FESTIVAL 2017 qual B - Largest Smallest Cyclic Shift

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the cyclic shift function.** The cyclic shift function should take a string as input and return a new string that is the same as the input string, but with the first character moved to the end. For example, the cyclic shift of the string `"abc"` should be `"bca"`.
2. **Incorrect handling of the case where the input values do not correspond to a valid string.** For example, if the input values are `X = 5`, `Y = 0`, and `Z = 0`, then there is no way to construct a string that consists of exactly 5 `a`s, 0 `b`s, and 0 `c`s. In this case, the correct output is `""` (the empty string).
3. **Incorrect handling of the case where there are multiple possible strings that maximize the lexicographical value of f(T).** In this case, the correct output is any one of the possible strings.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. Use a test suite to thoroughly test your implementation of the cyclic shift function.
2. Make sure to handle the case where the input values do not correspond to a valid string.
3. Be aware of the fact that there may be multiple possible strings that maximize the lexicographical value of f(T), and choose any one of them as the output.

ATCODER p03739 AtCoder Beginner Contest 059 - Sequence

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of variables.** In the following code, `n` is used to store the input, but `i` is used to store the number of operations. This will result in an incorrect answer.

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
i = 0
while True:
    if sum(a) != 0:
        break
    i += 1
    for j in range(n):
        a[j] += 1

print(i)
```

2. **Incorrect logic.** In the following code, the condition `sum(a) != 0` is checked before the loop. This means that the loop will never be executed, and the program will terminate with an error.

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

if sum(a) != 0:
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += 1

print(sum(a))
```

3. **Off-by-one errors.** In the following code, the loop iterates from `0` to `n - 1`, but the condition `i < n` is checked. This means that the loop will not iterate over the last element of the array, and the program will produce an incorrect answer.

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(0, n - 1):
    if sum(a[0:i + 1]) != 0:

4. **Using the wrong data type.** In the following code, the input is read as a string, but it is then converted to an integer. This will result in an incorrect answer.

```
n = input()
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

if sum(a) != 0:
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += 1

print(sum(a))
```

5. **Not handling edge cases.** In the following code, the condition `n == 1` is not handled. This means that the program will crash if the input is a single integer.

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

if sum(a) != 0:
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += 1

print(sum(a))

Title:
AIZU p00795 Co-occurrence Search

Pain points:

 1. **Incorrectly handling the input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make mistakes when reading it in. For example, you might accidentally miss a newline character, or you might misinterpret the meaning of a certain character. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Not handling the edge cases correctly.** There are a few edge cases that you need to be aware of when solving this problem. For example, what happens if the input string is empty? What happens if the key character set is empty? What happens if the input string doesn't contain any of the key characters? If you don't handle these edge cases correctly, your program will produce incorrect results.
3. **Using inefficient algorithms.** There are a number of different algorithms that you can use to solve this problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. If you use an inefficient algorithm, your program will take longer to run.
4. **Making programming mistakes.** Even the best programmers make mistakes. When you're writing a program to solve this problem, it's important to be careful and to check your code carefully for errors. Otherwise, your program might produce incorrect results or it might crash.

Here are some specific examples of problems that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer might incorrectly handle the input format. For example, they might accidentally miss a newline character, or they might misinterpret the meaning of a certain character. This could lead to incorrect results.
* The developer might not handle the edge cases correctly. For example, they might not handle the case where the input string is empty, or the case where the key character set is empty. This could lead to incorrect results.
* The developer might use an inefficient algorithm. For example, they might use a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem, which would take a very long time to run.
* The developer might make programming mistakes. For example, they might forget to initialize a variable, or they might use the wrong data type for a variable. This could lead to incorrect results or it might cause the program to crash.

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct.**

The input format is "n m
a1 a2 ... am". If the input format is not correct, the program will crash.

**2. The input data is not valid.**

The input data should be integers and should be in the range of [1, 10^5]. If the input data is not valid, the program will crash.

**3. The program does not handle the corner cases correctly.**

There are some corner cases in this problem. For example, if m = 0, then all idols already have the secret information. The program should handle these corner cases correctly.

**4. The program has a bug.**

The program may have a bug that causes it to output the wrong answer. For example, the program may not consider the fact that idol 1 can only transmit information to idol 2, and idol n can only transmit information to idol n-1.

**5. The program is inefficient.**

The program can be inefficient if it uses a brute-force approach. A more efficient approach would be to use a greedy algorithm.

AIZU p01496 Bicube

Pain points:
**Possible Problems and Bugs**

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined. For example, the input could contain a newline character after the first line, or the input could contain spaces between the two integers H and W. The program should be able to handle these cases gracefully.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single word, either "Yes" or "No". The program should not output anything else, such as a newline character or a space.
3. **Incorrectly identifying connected components**. The program should correctly identify the connected components of the sheet. Two squares are connected if they share a common edge. However, two squares that share only a common vertex are not connected.
4. **Incorrectly identifying the colors of the faces of the bicube**. The faces of the bicube are identified by the colors of the squares on the front side of the sheet. The program should correctly identify the colors of the faces of the bicube.
5. **Incorrectly checking if the bicube is valid**. The bicube is valid if it satisfies the following conditions:
    * The faces of the unit cubes that come to the inside of the bicube are all black.
    * Each face of the bicube has a uniform colorful color.
    * The faces of the bicube have colors all different.
The program should correctly check if the bicube is valid.

Title:
AIZU p02093 Invariant Tree

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the input**

The input is a list of integers, so we should use a list to store the input. However, if we accidentally use a string to store the input, we will get a runtime error.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem is asking us to find the number of trees that satisfy a certain condition. We can use the following algorithm to solve the problem:

1. Construct a graph where the vertices are the numbers from 1 to N and the edges are the pairs of numbers that are adjacent in the input list.
2. Find all the connected components of the graph.
3. For each connected component, find the number of ways to order the vertices in the component such that the condition is satisfied.
4. Add up the number of ways for each connected component to get the final answer.

However, this algorithm is not correct. The reason is that it does not take into account the fact that the edges in the graph are directed. For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3]`, the algorithm will incorrectly count the number of ways to order the vertices as 3, when the correct answer is 2.

**3. Using the wrong modulo**

The problem states that the output should be modulo 998244353. However, if we accidentally use a different modulo, we will get the wrong answer.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

When counting the number of ways to order the vertices in a connected component, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, if the connected component has 4 vertices, we might accidentally count the number of ways to order the vertices as 5.

**5. Using the wrong data structure**

The problem states that the output should be a single number. However, if we accidentally print out a list of numbers, we will get a runtime error.

AIZU p02226 Test

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the UnionFind data structure.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. The UnionFind data structure must be implemented correctly in order to ensure that the algorithm works correctly.
2. **Incorrect handling of the input data.** The input data for this problem can be tricky to parse correctly. Developers must be careful to ensure that they correctly parse the input data and that they do not make any mistakes when doing so.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for solving this problem is not particularly difficult, but it is important to implement it correctly in order to ensure that the solution is correct. Developers must be careful to ensure that they correctly implement the algorithm and that they do not make any mistakes when doing so.
4. **Incorrect debugging of the solution.** Once the solution has been implemented, it is important to debug the solution to ensure that it is correct. Developers must be careful to check for all possible errors and to ensure that the solution works correctly on all possible inputs.
5. **Incorrect submission of the solution.** Once the solution has been debugged and tested, it is important to submit the solution correctly. Developers must be careful to ensure that they submit the solution in the correct format and that they do not make any mistakes when doing so.
