Title:
CODECHEF acmicl3

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type to store the number of people in the library.**

The problem states that the number of people in the library can be at most 50000. However, if we use an integer data type to store this number, we may encounter an overflow error if the number of people in the library is greater than 2147483647. To avoid this problem, we should use a long integer data type to store the number of people in the library.

**2. Using an incorrect data type to store the names of the people in the library.**

The problem states that the names of the people in the library can have a length of at most 30 characters. However, if we use a character array to store the names of the people in the library, we may encounter a buffer overflow error if the length of a name is greater than 255 characters. To avoid this problem, we should use a string data type to store the names of the people in the library.

**3. Not using a loop to iterate over the names of the people in the library.**

The problem states that there are n names in the file. To find out how many people are in the library, we need to iterate over the names of the people in the file and count the number of unique names. If we do not use a loop to iterate over the names of the people in the file, we will not be able to find out how many people are in the library.

**4. Not using a set to store the unique names of the people in the library.**

To find out how many people are in the library, we need to find out the number of unique names in the file. We can do this by using a set to store the unique names of the people in the file. A set is a data structure that stores a collection of unique elements. When we add an element to a set, the set checks to see if the element already exists in the set. If the element already exists in the set, the set does not add the element to the set. This means that the set will only contain unique elements.

**5. Not using the correct algorithm to find the number of unique names in the file.**

There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to find the number of unique names in a file. The most efficient algorithm is the hash table algorithm. The hash table algorithm uses a hash table to store the unique names in the file. A hash table is a data structure that stores a collection of key-value pairs. The keys in a hash table are used to index the values in the hash table. When we add a key-value pair to a hash table, the hash table uses the key to index the value in the hash table. This means that we can quickly find the value associated with a given key in the hash table.

The hash table algorithm works by first creating a hash table that is the same size as the number of names in the file. Then, we iterate over the names in the file and add each name to the hash table. When we add a name to the hash table, we use the name as the key and the value associated with the key is the number of times that the name appears in the file. After we have added all of the names to the hash table, we can find the number of unique names in the file by counting the number of entries in the hash table.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correctly parsed by the compiler. This can lead to errors such as incorrect variable assignment or segmentation fault.

**2. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. This can lead to incorrect results or infinite loops.

**3. Incorrect data type**

The data type used to store the input or output values may be incorrect. This can lead to errors such as overflow or underflow.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors occur when a loop iterates one too many or one too few times. This can lead to incorrect results.

**5. Floating-point errors**

Floating-point arithmetic is not exact, and this can lead to errors in the results of calculations.

**6. Memory errors**

Memory errors can occur when a program allocates too much or too little memory. This can lead to crashes or incorrect results.

**7. Race conditions**

Race conditions occur when two or more threads access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or data corruption.

**8. Deadlocks**

Title:
CODECHEF doors

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The variable `n` should be an integer, but it is declared as a string. This will cause a type error.
2. **Incorrect loop condition:** The loop condition `i <= n` should be `i < n`, otherwise the loop will never terminate.
3. **Incorrect loop increment:** The loop increment `i++` should be `i + 1`, otherwise the loop will not iterate correctly.
4. **Incorrect logic:** The logic for calculating the number of open doors is incorrect. The correct logic is:

```
num_open_doors = 0
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if n % i == 0:
        num_open_doors += 1
```

5. **Incorrect output format:** The output should be a single integer, but the code is printing a multi-line string.

To fix these problems, we can make the following changes to the code:

```
n = int(input())

for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if n % i == 0:
        n -= 1

print(n)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect type conversions.** The input is given as two integers, but the output is a real number. The developer may incorrectly convert the integers to real numbers, which would lead to incorrect results.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** The developer may forget to account for the fact that the box has 12 edges, not 11. This would lead to an incorrect calculation of the volume.
3. **Incorrect use of mathematical formulas.** The developer may incorrectly use the formula for the volume of a rectangular box. This would lead to an incorrect calculation of the volume.
4. **Incorrect rounding.** The developer may not round the output to two decimal places, which would lead to incorrect results.
5. **Other logic errors.** The developer may make other logic errors in their solution, which would lead to incorrect results.

Title:
CODECHEF notatri

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is N (3 ≤ N ≤ 2,000) wooden sticks, which are labeled from 1 to N. The i-th stick has a length of Li (1 ≤ Li ≤ 1,000,000). Your friend has challenged you to a simple game: you will pick three sticks at random, and if your friend can form a triangle with them (degenerate triangles included), he wins; otherwise, you win. You are not sure if your friend is trying to trick you, so you would like to determine your chances of winning by computing the number of ways you could choose three sticks (regardless of order) such that it is impossible to form a triangle with them.

If the input format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the input is N = 3, but the next line contains only two numbers, the program may crash.

**2. Using incorrect data types**

The data types used to store the input values must be able to hold the maximum possible values. For example, if the input values are all integers less than 10, the data type int is sufficient. However, if the input values can be as large as 1,000,000, the data type int is not sufficient and you must use a data type such as long long.

Using incorrect data types can lead to incorrect results or even a crash. For example, if the input values are all integers less than 10, but you use the data type long long to store them, the program may crash when it tries to perform arithmetic operations on the values.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a developer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. In this problem, an off-by-one error could occur when computing the number of triples that cannot form a triangle. For example, if the sticks are labeled 1, 2, and 3, and the longest stick is 5, the number of triples that cannot form a triangle is 2 (1 + 2 < 5 and 2 + 3 < 5). However, if the developer forgets to increment the variable by one, the number of triples that cannot form a triangle will be 1 (1 + 2 < 5).

**4. Using incorrect algorithms**

The algorithm used to solve this problem must be correct. For example, a naive algorithm that simply checks if each triple of sticks can form a triangle will not work, because it is possible for two sticks to be collinear (i.e., they form a line segment). A more efficient algorithm would first sort the sticks by length, and then check if any two sticks are adjacent in the sorted list.

Using an incorrect algorithm can lead to incorrect results or even a crash. For example, the naive algorithm described above will not work for the input N = 3, L1 = 1, L2 = 2, and L3 = 3, because it will incorrectly conclude that the sticks cannot form a triangle.

**5. Using incorrect data structures**

The data structures used to store the input values and the intermediate results must be efficient. For example, if the input values are all integers less than 10, a vector of integers would be sufficient. However, if the input values can be as large as 1,000,000, a vector of integers would not be efficient, and you would need to use a data structure such as a sorted set.

Using incorrect data structures can lead to incorrect results or even a crash. For example, if the input values are all integers less than 10, but you use a sorted set to store them, the program may crash when it tries to insert a value that is already in the set.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect logic**. The logic used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the developer may not account for all of the possible cases or may make a mistake in their calculations.
2. **Incorrect implementation**. The developer may implement the solution incorrectly. For example, they may use the wrong data types or may not handle errors correctly.
3. **Runtime errors**. The developer's code may not run correctly due to runtime errors. For example, the code may run out of memory or may cause a segmentation fault.
4. **Syntax errors**. The developer's code may contain syntax errors. For example, they may forget to close a bracket or may use the wrong keyword.
5. **Documentation errors**. The developer's code may not be well-documented. This can make it difficult for other developers to understand and maintain the code.
6. **Testing errors**. The developer may not test their code thoroughly. This can lead to bugs being introduced into the code that are not caught until it is too late.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully review their code and test it thoroughly before releasing it. They should also use a debugger to help identify and fix any errors.

CODEFORCES 1003_E. Tree Constructing

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct.**

The input format should be three integers n, d, and k, separated by spaces. For example, `6 3 3`.

**2. The output format is not correct.**

The output should be either `YES` or `NO`, followed by the edges of the tree. For example, `YES
3 1
4 1
1 2
5 2
2 6`.

**3. The tree does not satisfy the given conditions.**

The tree must have diameter d and degree of each vertex at most k. For example, the tree in the following input does not satisfy the given conditions:

```
6 2 3
```

**4. The tree is not a tree.**

A tree is a connected undirected graph with n - 1 edges. For example, the following graph is not a tree:

```
5 3 3
1 2
2 3
3 4
```

**5. The tree is not unique.**

The output should be any tree that satisfies the given conditions. For example, the following two trees are both valid solutions to the input `6 3 3`:

Title:
CODEFORCES 1027_F. Session in BSU

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is specified as follows:

```
The first line of the input contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) — the number of exams.

The next n lines contain two integers each: a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i < b_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i is the number of day of the first passing the i-th exam and b_i is the number of day of the second passing the i-th exam.
```

If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash or produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect data**

The data for this problem is specified as a list of pairs of integers, where each pair represents the start and end dates of an exam. The start date must be less than the end date, and the dates must be valid integers. If the data is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem and will likely crash or produce incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve this problem must be correct in order to produce the correct output. A common mistake is to use an incorrect sorting algorithm, which can lead to incorrect results. Another common mistake is to use an incorrect data structure, which can also lead to incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem must be a single integer, which represents the minimum index of day by which Polycarp can pass all the n exams. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly submit the solution and will likely receive a negative score.

**5. Other bugs**

There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem, including:

* Memory leaks
* Race conditions
* Deadlocks
* Syntax errors
* Runtime errors

It is important to be aware of these potential bugs and to take steps to avoid them when writing code.
Test inputs:
```
# 1. Incorrect input format

CODEFORCES 1070_D. Garbage Disposal

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is two integers n and k, followed by n space-separated integers a_i. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer, the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all of his garbage. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be accepted by the judge.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

There are many different algorithms that could be used to solve this problem. However, not all algorithms are guaranteed to find the optimal solution. For example, a naive algorithm that simply iterates through the input and creates a bag for each unit of garbage would not be guaranteed to find the optimal solution.

**4. Using inefficient data structures**

The data structures used to solve this problem can have a significant impact on the runtime performance. For example, using a hash table to store the number of units of garbage produced on each day would be much more efficient than using a linked list.

**5. Not handling edge cases correctly**

The input for this problem may contain edge cases, such as n = 0 or k = 0. These edge cases must be handled correctly in order for the program to be correct.

**6. Not using appropriate data types**

The data types used to store the input and output data can have a significant impact on the runtime performance. For example, using integers to store the number of units of garbage produced on each day would be much more efficient than using floating-point numbers.

**7. Not using appropriate variable names**

Using clear and descriptive variable names can make the code easier to read and debug. For example, using the variable name `num_bags` to store the number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all of his garbage would be much more clear than using the variable name `n`.

**8. Not commenting the code**

Commenting the code can help other developers understand what the code is doing. This is especially important for complex algorithms or code that is not immediately obvious.

**9. Not testing the code**

Testing the code is essential to ensure that it is correct. This can be done by writing unit tests or by manually testing the code with a variety of inputs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1110_F. Nearest Leaf

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of Eulerian traversal**

The Eulerian traversal is a depth-first search algorithm that traverses vertices of a tree in the order of visiting. It starts from the vertex number 1 and then recursively runs from all vertices which are connected with an edge with the current vertex and are not yet visited in increasing numbers order.

A common mistake is to implement the Eulerian traversal incorrectly. For example, you might start from the vertex number 1 and then recursively run from all vertices which are connected with an edge with the current vertex and are already visited in increasing numbers order. This will result in an incorrect traversal of the tree.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the distance between two vertices**

The distance between two vertices in a tree is the sum of weights of the edges on the simple path between them. A common mistake is to calculate the distance between two vertices incorrectly. For example, you might calculate the distance between two vertices as the sum of weights of all edges in the tree that are incident to either of the vertices. This will result in an incorrect distance.

**3. Incorrect handling of queries**

The queries are given in the form of three integers v, l, and r. The first integer v is the index of the vertex, the second integer l is the lower bound of the interval, and the third integer r is the upper bound of the interval. A common mistake is to handle the queries incorrectly. For example, you might only consider queries where l is less than r. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output should be a list of integers, where each integer is the answer to one of the queries. A common mistake is to output the answers in the wrong format. For example, you might output the answers as a string instead of a list. This will result in an incorrect output.

**5. Runtime error**

The program might run into a runtime error if it is not properly optimized. For example, the program might use too much memory or take too long to run. A common mistake is to not optimize the program properly. This will result in a runtime error.

**6. Memory leak**

The program might leak memory if it is not properly cleaned up. For example, the program might not delete objects that are no longer needed. A common mistake is to not clean up the memory properly. This will result in a memory leak.

CODEFORCES 1140_C. Playlist

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect sorting**. The input is first sorted by the length of the songs, and then by the beauty of the songs. This is incorrect because the pleasure of listening to a set of songs is equal to the total length of the songs in the set multiplied by the minimum beauty among them. So, the input should be sorted by the minimum beauty of the songs.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum beauty**. The minimum beauty of a set of songs is the smallest beauty value of any song in the set. However, the minimum beauty of a set of songs is not necessarily the same as the minimum beauty of any song in the set. For example, if the set of songs contains two songs with beauty values 1 and 2, then the minimum beauty of the set is 1, even though the minimum beauty of any song in the set is 2.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the total length of the songs**. The total length of a set of songs is the sum of the lengths of all the songs in the set. However, the total length of a set of songs is not necessarily the same as the sum of the lengths of any subset of the songs in the set. For example, if the set of songs contains two songs with lengths 1 and 2, then the total length of the set is 3, even though the sum of the lengths of any subset of the songs in the set is 2.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the pleasure**. The pleasure of listening to a set of songs is equal to the total length of the songs in the set multiplied by the minimum beauty among them. However, the pleasure of listening to a set of songs is not necessarily the same as the product of the total length of the songs in the set and the minimum beauty among them. For example, if the set of songs contains two songs with lengths 1 and 2 and beauty values 1 and 2, then the pleasure of listening to the set is 2, even though the product of the total length of the songs in the set and the minimum beauty among them is 4.

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n, and the second line should contain a string s. However, if the input format is not followed, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect use of variables.** The program should use variables appropriately to store the input data and to perform the necessary calculations. If variables are used incorrectly, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The program should implement the correct logic to solve the problem. If the logic is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** The program should be careful to account for all possible cases, and to avoid off-by-one errors. Off-by-one errors can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
5. **Memory leaks.** The program should free any memory that it allocates, to avoid memory leaks. Memory leaks can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
6. **Race conditions.** The program should be careful to avoid race conditions, where two threads or processes try to access the same data at the same time. Race conditions can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
7. **Synchronization issues.** The program should be careful to synchronize access to shared data, to avoid data corruption. Synchronization issues can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
8. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program should be careful to avoid security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows and SQL injection attacks. Security vulnerabilities can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or to the data that it stores.
9. **Error handling.** The program should handle errors gracefully, by printing informative error messages and exiting gracefully. If the program does not handle errors gracefully, it may crash or produce incorrect output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1281_C. Cut and Paste

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect understanding of the problem statement

The most important problem that a developer may encounter when solving this problem is incorrect understanding of the problem statement. For example, a developer may mistakenly assume that the cursor can only move to the right, when in fact it can also move to the left. This mistake would lead to incorrect results.

### 2. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm

Another common problem is incorrect implementation of the algorithm. For example, a developer may forget to update the value of the cursor after performing a move operation. This mistake would also lead to incorrect results.

### 3. Using incorrect data types

Another problem that can occur is using incorrect data types. For example, a developer may use an integer to store the length of the string, when in fact the length of the string can be much larger than the maximum value of an integer. This mistake would lead to overflow errors.

### 4. Not handling special cases correctly

Finally, a developer must be careful to handle special cases correctly. For example, what happens if the input string is empty? What happens if the value of `x` is greater than the length of the string? A developer must be sure to handle these cases correctly in order to avoid incorrect results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1301_C. Ayoub's function

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

When working with large numbers, it is important to use the correct data type. For example, if you are working with integers that are larger than 2^31 - 1, you should use the `long` data type instead of the `int` data type.

**2. Using incorrect math operations**

When working with large numbers, it is important to be careful with your math operations. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
n = 10 ** 18
m = 10 ** 18
print(n + m)
```

This code will produce an overflow error, because the sum of two 18-digit numbers is too large to be represented by a 32-bit integer.

To avoid this problem, you can use the `long` data type or you can use the `math` library to perform your math operations.

**3. Using incorrect algorithms**

When solving a problem, it is important to use the correct algorithm. For example, the following algorithm is incorrect for finding the maximum subarray sum:

```
def max_subarray_sum(nums):
    current_sum = 0
    maximum_sum = 0
    for n in nums:
        current_sum += n
        if current_sum > maximum_sum:
            maximum_sum = current_sum
        if current_sum < 0:
            current_sum = 0
    return maximum_sum
```

This algorithm will not work correctly for negative numbers, because it will reset the current sum to 0 whenever the sum becomes negative.

To fix this problem, you can use the following algorithm:

```
def max_subarray_sum(nums):
    current_sum = 0
    maximum_sum = 0
    for n in nums:
        current_sum += n
        if current_sum > maximum_sum:
            maximum_sum = current_sum
        current_sum = max(current_sum, 0)
    return maximum_sum
```

**4. Not handling edge cases**

When solving a problem, it is important to handle all of the edge cases. For example, the following code will not work correctly for empty arrays:

```
def max_subarray_sum(nums):
    if len(nums) == 0:
        return 0
    return max(nums)
```

To fix this problem, you can add the following code to handle the empty array case:

```
def max_subarray_sum(nums):
    if len(nums) == 0:
        return 0
    return max(nums)
```

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before you submit it. This will help you to identify any bugs in your code and to fix them before it is too late.

You can test your code by using the following steps:

1. Write a test case that exercises the code.
2. Run the test case and make sure that it passes.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all of your test cases pass.

By following these steps, you can help to ensure that your code is correct and that it will work as expected.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may contain a number that is not between 0 and n-2 inclusive, or a number that is repeated in the output.
3. **Incorrect solution**. The solution may not satisfy all of the constraints in the problem statement. For example, the solution may not assign distinct labels to all of the edges, or the solution may not minimize the largest value of MEX(u,v) over all pairs of nodes (u,v).
4. **Memory limit exceeded**. The solution may use too much memory, which will cause the program to crash.
5. **Time limit exceeded**. The solution may take too long to run, which will cause the program to time out.
6. **Compilation error**. The solution may not compile due to syntax errors or other problems.
7. **Runtime error**. The solution may cause the program to crash due to errors such as division by zero or accessing a non-existent memory location.
8. **Incorrect answer**. The solution may not produce the correct output, even if it satisfies all of the constraints in the problem statement.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1344_B. Monopole Magnets

Pain points:
**1. Mismatch of input and output format**

The input format is two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` lines of strings. The output format is a single integer.

**2. Incorrect assumptions about the input**

The input is guaranteed to be valid, but it is possible to make incorrect assumptions about it. For example, you might assume that there will always be at least one black cell, or that there will never be two black cells in the same row or column.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When counting the number of black cells or the number of south magnets, it is easy to make a mistake and count one cell or magnet too many or too few.

**4. Incorrect use of pointers**

When using pointers to iterate over the input, it is easy to make a mistake and skip a cell or overwrite a value.

**5. Logical errors**

When solving a problem like this, it is easy to make a logical error in your reasoning. For example, you might incorrectly assume that if a cell is black, then it is possible to move a north magnet to that cell.

**6. Runtime errors**

When implementing your solution, it is important to avoid runtime errors such as running out of memory or accessing invalid memory.

**7. Incorrect test cases**

When testing your solution, it is important to include a variety of test cases, including cases that test for the different types of errors that can occur.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1366_B. Shuffle

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format for this problem is not very clear. It is not clear what the meaning of the `n, x, m` numbers are. It is also not clear what the meaning of the `l_i, r_i` numbers are. This can lead to the developer incorrectly parsing the input and getting the wrong answer.

### 2. Incorrect logic

The logic for this problem is not very straightforward. The developer needs to keep track of the state of the array after each operation. They also need to be careful not to swap two elements that are already equal to 1. This can be a difficult problem to get right, and it is easy for the developer to make a mistake.

### 3. Off-by-one errors

There are a number of places where the developer could make an off-by-one error. For example, they could forget to increment or decrement a variable by one, or they could incorrectly compare two numbers. These errors can be difficult to find, and they can lead to the developer getting the wrong answer.

### 4. Memory leaks

The developer should be careful to free any memory that they allocate. If they do not free the memory, it can lead to a memory leak. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.

### 5. Race conditions

If the developer is using multiple threads, they need to be careful to avoid race conditions. A race condition occurs when two threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program getting the wrong answer or crashing.

### 6. Deadlocks

If the developer is using multiple threads, they need to be careful to avoid deadlocks. A deadlock occurs when two threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can prevent the program from making any progress and it can eventually crash.

### 7. Security vulnerabilities

The developer should be careful to avoid security vulnerabilities in their code. For example, they should not store passwords in plaintext or allow users to upload malicious files.

### 8. Testing

The developer should write unit tests to test their code. This will help them to catch bugs early and prevent them from causing problems in production.

CODEFORCES 1451_F. Nullify The Matrix

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is a 2D array of integers. If the developer does not correctly typecast the input data to integers, the program will not work correctly.

**2. Incorrect logic**

The game is played on an n × m matrix. The developer needs to correctly implement the rules of the game, such as the shortest path between two cells, and the conditions for winning and losing.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

The developer needs to be careful about off-by-one errors when iterating over the 2D array. For example, if the developer iterates over the array from row 0 to n - 1, they will miss the last row.

**4. Memory leaks**

The developer needs to be careful about memory leaks. For example, if the developer creates a 2D array of size n × m, they need to make sure to free the memory when they are finished with it.

**5. Runtime errors**

The developer needs to be careful about runtime errors, such as division by zero. For example, if the developer tries to divide the value of a cell by zero, the program will crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1525_E. Assimilation IV

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is two integers n and m, followed by n lines of m integers each. If the input format is not correct, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is a single integer, which is the expected number of points Monocarp conquers at the end of the n-th turn. If the output format is not correct, the program will get a Wrong Answer verdict.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the expected number of points**

The expected number of points Monocarp conquers at the end of the n-th turn can be represented as an irreducible fraction x/y. To calculate this fraction, we need to find the probability that a point is controlled by a Monument at each turn. The probability that a point is controlled by a Monument at turn t is equal to the number of cities that can control the point at turn t divided by the total number of cities. We can then use the following formula to calculate the expected number of points Monocarp conquers at the end of the n-th turn:

```
E[X] = \sum_{t=1}^n \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{d_{i,j}}{t+1}
```

where d_{i,j} is the distance between the i-th city and the j-th point.

**4. Overflow**

The expected number of points Monocarp conquers at the end of the n-th turn can be very large, so we need to be careful to avoid overflow. We can do this by using the following formula:

```
E[X] = \sum_{t=1}^n \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{d_{i,j}}{t+1} \mod 998244353
```

This formula will ensure that the expected number of points Monocarp conquers at the end of the n-th turn is always less than or equal to 998244353.

Title:
CODEFORCES 157_B. Trace

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is "n\nri1 ri2 ... rin", where n is the number of circles and ri is the radius of the ith circle. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format for this problem is a single real number representing the total area of the red parts of the wall. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be accepted by the judge.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the area of the red parts**. The area of the red parts is calculated by summing the areas of all the red regions. Each red region is a ring between two circles. The area of a ring is calculated by subtracting the area of the smaller circle from the area of the larger circle.
4. **Floating-point rounding errors**. When calculating the area of the red parts, it is important to use floating-point arithmetic. This is because the areas of the circles and rings are often very small, and rounding errors can cause the final answer to be incorrect.
5. **Off-by-one errors**. When counting the number of red regions, it is important to be careful not to count the same region twice. This can happen if two circles are concentric, or if two circles overlap.
6. **Incorrect use of mathematical functions**. The problem statement specifies that the answer should be accurate to within 10-4. This means that the program must use mathematical functions that are accurate to this precision.
7. **Incorrect use of the math library**. The math library provides a number of functions that can be used to calculate the area of circles and rings. However, it is important to use these functions correctly. For example, the `pow()` function returns the value of x raised to the power of y. If y is negative, the `pow()` function returns a complex number. This can cause the program to crash.
8. **Incorrect use of the `cin` and `cout` functions**. The `cin` and `cout` functions are used to read and write data from the console. However, it is important to use these functions correctly. For example, the `cin` function reads a single value from the console. If the user enters more than one value, the `cin` function will only read the first value. This can cause the program to crash.
9. **Incorrect use of the `vector` class**. The `vector` class is a data structure that can be used to store a collection of objects. However, it is important to use the `vector` class correctly. For example, the `vector` class does not automatically resize itself. This means that the program must explicitly resize the `vector` before adding new elements.
10. **Incorrect use of the `algorithm` library**. The `algorithm` library provides a number of functions that can be used to perform common operations on data structures. However, it is important to use these functions correctly. For example, the `sort()` function sorts a `vector` in ascending order. If the `vector` contains negative values, the `sort()` function will sort the values in descending order. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 178_A2. Educational Game

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly and that you are not introducing any errors. For example, if you are using the `scanf()` function to read the input, you need to make sure that you are using the correct format specifier.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also very specific. It is important to make sure that you are printing the output in the correct format. For example, you need to make sure that you are using the correct number of spaces between the numbers.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

This problem is very susceptible to off-by-one errors. It is important to make sure that you are calculating the correct values for each of the subproblems. For example, if you are calculating the number of moves needed to make the first `k` elements of the sequence equal to zero, you need to make sure that you are not counting the first element twice.

**4. Undefined behavior**

This problem can also be susceptible to undefined behavior. For example, if you are using the `%lld` specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++, you need to make sure that the values that you are reading or writing are actually 64-bit integers. If you are not careful, you could end up reading or writing a value that is not a valid 64-bit integer, which could lead to undefined behavior.

**5. Memory leaks**

This problem can also lead to memory leaks if you are not careful. For example, if you are using dynamic memory allocation, you need to make sure that you are freeing the memory that you allocate when you are finished with it. If you do not free the memory, you could end up with a memory leak.

**6. Runtime errors**

This problem can also lead to runtime errors if you are not careful. For example, if you are trying to divide by zero, you will get a runtime error. You need to make sure that you are checking for division by zero before you attempt to divide.

Title:
CODEFORCES 19_C. Deletion of Repeats

Pain points:
### Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrectly identifying repeats.** A repeat is a substring of length $2x$, that its first half coincides character by character with its second half. For example, the string "abcabc" contains a repeat of length 3. However, the string "abcabca" does not contain a repeat of length 3, because the first half of the substring "abcabc" does not coincide character by character with its second half.
2. **Not handling repeats that are not unique.** Bob takes the shortest repeat, if it is not unique, he takes the leftmost one. For example, the string "abcabcabc" contains two repeats of length 3. Bob will take the leftmost repeat, which is "abc". He will then delete its left half, which is "a", and everything that is to the left of this repeat, which is "b". The resulting string will be "bcabc".
3. **Not handling strings that do not contain any repeats.** The input string may not contain any repeats. In this case, Bob will not delete anything from the string. The output should be the length of the original string, and the original string itself.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. Carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand what is being asked.
2. Use a debugger to step through your code and make sure that it is correctly identifying and deleting repeats.
3. Test your code on a variety of inputs, including strings that do not contain any repeats.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

CODEFORCES 272_C. Dima and Staircase

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data contains a lot of integers, so it is important to use the correct data type to store them. In this problem, the input data contains integers up to 10^9, so we need to use `long long` to store them.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the height of the bottom of the box after landing. We can use the following algorithm to solve this problem:

1. Sort the boxes by their width in increasing order.
2. For each box, find the largest stair that is below the box. The height of the bottom of the box after landing is the height of this stair.

**3. Not handling corner cases**

The problem statement mentions that "we only consider touching of the horizontal sides of stairs and boxes, at that touching with the corners isn't taken into consideration". We need to make sure that our algorithm handles this corner case correctly.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The problem statement asks us to print the output in a specific format. We need to make sure that our output is in the correct format.

**5. Runtime error**

Title:
CODEFORCES 366_E. Dima and Magic Guitar

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may contain incorrect data types. For example, a string instead of an integer. The developer should check the data type of each input value and raise an error if it is incorrect.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer may forget to add or subtract 1 when computing an index. For example, when computing the index of the next note in the song, the developer may forget to add 1 to the current index. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program. For example, the developer may forget to update a variable when it is changed. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer may not release memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
5. **Synchronization issues**. The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data. This can lead to race conditions, which can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer may not properly protect sensitive data. This can allow attackers to access or modify data that they should not be able to access.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully review the code and test it thoroughly.

Here are some specific tips for solving this problem:

* Use a data structure to store the notes in the song. This will make it easier to access the notes and compute the complexity of the song.
* Use a greedy algorithm to find the maximum possible complexity of the song. This algorithm should start with the first note in the song and greedily choose the next note that maximizes the complexity.
* Use a dynamic programming algorithm to find the maximum possible complexity of the song. This algorithm should build a table of the maximum complexity of the song up to a given point.
* Use a branch-and-bound algorithm to find the maximum possible complexity of the song. This algorithm should explore all possible ways to play the song and keep track of the best solution found so far.

Title:
CODEFORCES 45_I. TCMCF+++

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data contains integers, so we should use the `int` data type to store them. If we use a smaller data type, such as `char` or `short`, we may lose precision and get the wrong answer.

For example, the following code will print the wrong answer for the input `100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100`:

```
int n;
int arr[100];
scanf(" %d ", &n);
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf(" %d ", &arr[i]);
}
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    printf("%d ", arr[i]);
}
```

The correct answer is `100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100`, but the code above prints `100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 10000`. This is because the `char` data type can only store values from `0` to `255`, so the value of `100` is truncated to `0`.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the costs of the problems that needed to be solved to get the maximal possible number of points. A naive algorithm would be to try all possible combinations of problems and choose the one that gives the highest product. However, this algorithm is very inefficient, as it has a time complexity of `O(2^n)`.

A more efficient algorithm is to use dynamic programming. The idea is to build a table `dp[i][j]`, where `i` is the index of the problem and `j` is the maximum number of points that can be earned by solving the first `i` problems. We can initialize `dp[0][0]` to `0` and `dp[0][j]` to `-∞` for all `j > 0`. Then, for each `i` from `1` to `n`, we can compute `dp[i][j]` as follows:

```
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - ci] * ci)
```

where `ci` is the cost of the `i`th problem. The final answer is the maximum value of `dp[n][j]` for all `j`.

**3. Formatting the output incorrectly**

The output should be a list of space-separated integers, representing the costs of the problems that needed to be solved to get the maximal possible number of points. For example, the following code would print the correct output for the input `100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100`:

```
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    printf("%d ", arr[i]);
}
```

**4. Not handling invalid input correctly**

The input may contain invalid values, such as negative costs or costs that are greater than `100`. We should check for these values and handle them appropriately. For example, we could print an error message and exit the program if we encounter an invalid value.

**5. Using global variables**

It is generally good practice to avoid using global variables, as they can make your code more difficult to read and debug. In this problem, we can use local variables instead of global variables.

**6. Not using comments**

Comments can help other developers understand your code. It is a good practice to add comments to your code, especially if it is complex or if you are using a non-standard algorithm.

CODEFORCES 507_C. Guess Your Way Out!

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm described in the problem statement is not trivial, and it is easy to make mistakes when implementing it. For example, you might forget to check if the destination node has already been visited, or you might not correctly handle the case where Amr skips two consecutive commands.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of nodes visited.** Once you have correctly implemented the algorithm, you still need to correctly calculate the number of nodes that Amr will visit before reaching the exit. This can be a bit tricky, especially if the tree is large.
3. **Incorrect input handling.** The input to the problem is a pair of integers h and n. You need to make sure that you correctly parse these integers and that you handle any errors that might occur.
4. **Incorrect output formatting.** The output to the problem should be a single integer representing the number of nodes that Amr will visit before reaching the exit. You need to make sure that your output is formatted correctly.
5. **Runtime errors.** If your code is not efficient enough, it might time out during the judging process. You need to make sure that your code is optimized to run as fast as possible.
6. **Memory errors.** If your code uses too much memory, it might be rejected by the judging system. You need to make sure that your code is memory-efficient.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* **Test your code thoroughly.** Before submitting your code, make sure that you have tested it thoroughly on a variety of inputs. This will help you to catch any errors in your implementation and to identify any problems with your algorithm.
* **Use a debugger.** A debugger can be a helpful tool for debugging your code. It can help you to track down the source of errors and to identify problems with your algorithm.
* **Read the problem statement carefully.** The problem statement is very important. Make sure that you understand the problem before you start coding.
* **Ask for help if you need it.** If you are stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help. There are many resources available online, such as forums and chat rooms, where you can get help from other programmers.

CODEFORCES 530_D. Set subtraction

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible that the user will input data in an incorrect format. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data.** The input data may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers greater than 1000. This can also lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The program may contain errors in its logic, such as failing to correctly subtract the intervals from the starting set or outputting the results in the wrong format. This can also lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over the intervals, it is possible to make an off-by-one error and skip an interval or include an interval twice. This can lead to the program producing incorrect output.
5. **Memory errors.** The program may not allocate enough memory to store the intervals or the resulting set. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
6. **Time complexity.** The program may take too long to run, especially if the number of intervals is large. This can be a problem if the program is running on a slow computer or if the user is impatient.
7. **Space complexity.** The program may use too much memory, especially if the number of intervals is large. This can be a problem if the program is running on a computer with limited memory.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully test the program with a variety of input data and to use a robust programming language and development environment.

CODEFORCES 556_D. Case of Fugitive

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to unexpected results. For example, if the number of islands is not an integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input may not be correct, which may lead to unexpected results. For example, if the coordinates of an island are not integers, the program may crash.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The program may incorrectly calculate the indices of the islands or bridges, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program tries to access the first bridge when there are no bridges, it will crash.
4. **Infinite loop**. The program may enter an infinite loop if it does not have a way to terminate. For example, if the program tries to find a bridge that does not exist, it will enter an infinite loop.
5. **Memory leak**. The program may not release memory that it has allocated, which may lead to a memory leak. For example, if the program creates a new array for each island, it will create a memory leak.
6. **Security vulnerability**. The program may be vulnerable to security attacks if it does not properly validate user input. For example, if the program allows users to input arbitrary code, it may be vulnerable to a code injection attack.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully follow the input format, use the correct data types, check for off-by-one errors, use appropriate termination conditions, and release memory when it is no longer needed. It is also important to be aware of potential security vulnerabilities and take steps to mitigate them.

Title:
CODEFORCES 582_B. Once Again...

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. The developer should check the input format and handle incorrect input accordingly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correctly followed. For example, the output may not be a single number, or it may not be the correct answer. The developer should check the output format and make sure that it is correct.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the algorithm may not find the longest non-decreasing sequence, or it may find a sequence that is not the longest possible. The developer should carefully design and implement the algorithm to ensure that it is correct.
4. **Incorrect data structures**. The developer may use incorrect data structures to solve the problem. For example, the data structures may not be able to store the input data efficiently, or they may not be able to find the longest non-decreasing sequence efficiently. The developer should carefully choose the data structures to use to ensure that they are appropriate for the problem.
5. **Incorrect runtime**. The developer may implement the algorithm in a way that takes too long to run. For example, the algorithm may use a recursive solution that takes exponential time, or it may use a brute-force solution that takes quadratic time. The developer should carefully optimize the algorithm to ensure that it runs in a reasonable amount of time.
6. **Incorrect memory usage**. The developer may implement the algorithm in a way that uses too much memory. For example, the algorithm may use a data structure that stores all of the input data, or it may use a recursive solution that creates a stack of all of the visited states. The developer should carefully optimize the algorithm to ensure that it uses a reasonable amount of memory.

CODEFORCES 604_B. More Cowbell

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input contains two integers separated by a comma instead of a space, the program may not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The input data may not be in the correct data type, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program may not be able to convert the string to an integer correctly.
3. **Off-by-one error.** The program may make an off-by-one error when calculating the output. For example, if the program is supposed to find the smallest number that is greater than or equal to the sum of all the numbers in a list, the program may return a number that is less than the sum of all the numbers.
4. **Infinite loop.** The program may enter an infinite loop if it is not properly designed. For example, if the program is supposed to find the smallest number that is greater than or equal to the sum of all the numbers in a list, the program may keep looping forever if the list is empty.
5. **Memory leak.** The program may leak memory if it does not properly free up the memory that it has allocated. This can eventually cause the program to crash.
6. **Security vulnerability.** The program may have a security vulnerability if it is not properly designed. For example, if the program allows users to input arbitrary data, the program may be vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack.

Title:
CODEFORCES 626_E. Simple Skewness

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect sorting algorithm.** The simple skewness of a collection is the difference between the mean and the median. To find the subset with the maximum simple skewness, we need to sort the collection and then find the subset that contains the largest elements. However, if the sorting algorithm is incorrect, the subset we find may not have the maximum simple skewness.
2. **Incorrect calculation of mean and median.** The mean of a collection is the sum of the elements divided by the number of elements. The median of a collection is the middle element when all of the elements are sorted, or the average of the two middle elements if the collection has an even number of elements. If the mean or median is calculated incorrectly, the subset we find may not have the maximum simple skewness.
3. **Incorrect choice of subset.** Once we have found the subset with the largest elements, we need to choose the subset that has the maximum simple skewness. This can be done by calculating the simple skewness of each possible subset and choosing the subset with the largest simple skewness. However, if we make a mistake in choosing the subset, the subset we find may not have the maximum simple skewness.
4. **Incorrect output.** The output of the program should be the size of the subset and the elements of the subset in any order. If the output is incorrect, the program will not be able to find the subset with the maximum simple skewness.

To avoid these problems, it is important to use a correct sorting algorithm, correctly calculate the mean and median, correctly choose the subset, and correctly output the results.

CODEFORCES 650_C. Table Compression

Pain points:
1. **Inconsistent data types**. The input data is given as a string of characters, but the problem statement requires the data to be integers. This can be fixed by using the `int()` function to convert the strings to integers.
2. **Incorrect use of loops**. The problem statement requires the algorithm to iterate over the rows and columns of the table, but the solution code iterates over the columns and then the rows. This will result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect use of conditional statements**. The problem statement requires the algorithm to compare the values in the table and output the smaller value, but the solution code compares the values and outputs the larger value. This will also result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The problem statement requires the algorithm to output the compressed table in the same format as the input table, but the solution code outputs the table with one fewer row. This will result in an incorrect answer.
5. **Memory leaks**. The problem statement does not specify how much memory the algorithm is allowed to use, but the solution code allocates a large amount of memory and never frees it. This can lead to a memory leak.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The problem statement does not specify any security requirements, but the solution code does not properly validate the input data. This could allow an attacker to exploit the code to gain unauthorized access to the system.

CODEFORCES 676_A. Nicholas and Permutation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n, and the second line should contain n distinct integers from 1 to n. However, a developer may accidentally input a line that does not match this format, such as a line that contains more than one integer or a line that contains a non-integer value. This could cause the program to crash or to output incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve this problem should find the minimum and maximum elements in the array and then swap them. However, a developer may accidentally use an incorrect algorithm, such as an algorithm that does not find the minimum and maximum elements or an algorithm that swaps two elements that are not the minimum and maximum elements. This could cause the program to output incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the program should print a single integer, which is the maximum possible distance between the minimum and the maximum elements. However, a developer may accidentally print the wrong output format, such as a line that contains more than one integer or a line that contains a non-integer value. This could cause the program to crash or to output incorrect results.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program should not allocate any memory that it does not need. However, a developer may accidentally allocate memory that is not needed, such as memory for an array that is larger than the input data. This could cause the program to run out of memory and to crash.
5. **Incorrect error handling**. The program should handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input format is incorrect, the program should print an error message and exit. However, a developer may accidentally ignore errors or print incorrect error messages. This could cause the program to behave in an unexpected way or to output incorrect results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 80_D. Falling Anvils

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the equation**

The equation given in the problem statement is not correctly implemented. The correct equation is:

```
p^2 - 2ap + a^2 + 4b^2 = 0
```

If this equation is incorrectly implemented, the solution will be incorrect.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the probability**

The probability of a successful anvil hit is calculated by integrating the function ```f(p) = 1 / sqrt(p^2 - 2ap + a^2 + 4b^2)``` over the interval ```[0, a]```. This integral can be calculated using the following formula:

```
P = 2 * sqrt(a^2 + 4b^2) * atan(sqrt((a^2 + 4b^2) / (2a)))
```

If this formula is incorrectly implemented, the solution will be incorrect.

**3. Numerical instability**

The calculation of the probability can be numerically unstable if the values of ```a``` and ```b``` are large. To avoid this, it is necessary to use a high precision floating-point arithmetic library.

**4. Overflow**

The calculation of the probability can overflow if the values of ```a``` and ```b``` are large. To avoid this, it is necessary to use a large integer type for the variables ```a``` and ```b```.

**5. Underflow**

The calculation of the probability can underflow if the values of ```a``` and ```b``` are small. To avoid this, it is necessary to use a small integer type for the variables ```a``` and ```b```.

CODEFORCES 925_F. Parametric Circulation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a line with more than 6 integers, the program may crash or output incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect edge representation**. The edges are represented as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the start and end vertices of the edge, as well as the coefficients of the linear functions for the upper and lower bounds of the circulation. However, if the number of edges is greater than 2000, the program may not be able to allocate enough memory to store all of the edges.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the probability**. The probability of existence of an lr-circulation is calculated by summing the probabilities of all possible circulations. However, if the number of possible circulations is too large, the program may not be able to calculate the probability accurately.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is a single real number, which represents the probability of existence of an lr-circulation. However, if the probability is too small, the program may output a zero instead.
5. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem, such as incorrect handling of edge intersections, incorrect calculation of the conservation condition, and incorrect handling of floating-point numbers.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain more than three integers, or the integers may not be separated by spaces. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The input data may be of the wrong type. For example, the number of sections may be a string instead of an integer. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**3. Undefined behavior**

The input data may contain values that are not defined for the problem. For example, the number of archers at a section may be negative. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

The program may miss one or more elements of the input data, or it may count an element twice. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output.

**5. Arithmetic errors**

The program may perform incorrect arithmetic operations on the input data. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output.

**6. Logical errors**

Title:
CODEFORCES 980_F. Cactus to Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the DFS algorithm.** The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that can be used to traverse a graph. It works by starting at a single vertex and recursively exploring all of its adjacent vertices. One common mistake that developers make when implementing the DFS algorithm is to forget to mark the vertices that have already been visited. This can lead to the algorithm getting stuck in an infinite loop.
2. **Incorrect use of the visited array.** The visited array is a data structure that is used to keep track of which vertices have already been visited by the DFS algorithm. One common mistake that developers make is to initialize the visited array to all false values. This can lead to the algorithm incorrectly marking vertices as visited, which can also lead to an infinite loop.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum distance between a node and a leaf.** The maximum distance between a node and a leaf is the length of the longest path from the node to a leaf. One common mistake that developers make is to only consider the direct path from the node to a leaf. This can lead to an incorrect calculation of the maximum distance.
4. **Incorrect handling of cycles.** The problem statement states that each vertex belongs to at most one simple cycle. This means that there cannot be any vertices that are connected to themselves or to more than one other vertex. One common mistake that developers make is to not check for cycles when traversing the graph. This can lead to the algorithm incorrectly calculating the maximum distance between a node and a leaf.
5. **Incorrect output format.** The problem statement specifies that the output should be a list of n space-separated integers, where the i-th integer represents the maximum distance between node i and a leaf. One common mistake that developers make is to not format the output correctly. This can lead to the submission being rejected by the judge.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The developer may incorrectly type the variable type, which could lead to errors. For example, the developer may declare a variable as `int` when it should be `string`.
2. **Incorrect loop condition:** The developer may incorrectly set the loop condition, which could lead to the loop running indefinitely or not running at all. For example, the developer may set the loop condition to `i < s.length()` when it should be `i < s.count()`.
3. **Incorrect use of `in` operator:** The developer may incorrectly use the `in` operator, which could lead to errors. For example, the developer may use the `in` operator to check if a character is in a string when it should be using the `contains()` method.
4. **Incorrect use of `count()` method:** The developer may incorrectly use the `count()` method, which could lead to errors. For example, the developer may use the `count()` method to get the number of occurrences of a character in a string when it should be using the `length()` method.
5. **Incorrect use of `substring()` method:** The developer may incorrectly use the `substring()` method, which could lead to errors. For example, the developer may use the `substring()` method to get a substring of a string when it should be using the `charAt()` method.
6. **Incorrect use of `charAt()` method:** The developer may incorrectly use the `charAt()` method, which could lead to errors. For example, the developer may use the `charAt()` method to get a character from a string when it should be using the `substring()` method.

HACKEREARTH bhavesh-and-colors

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement is not very clear, and it can be interpreted in different ways. For example, it is not clear whether the pre-set and end-set should be disjoint, or whether they can overlap. It is also not clear whether the longest subarray that is contained in both the pre-set and end-set should be contiguous or not.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution is not very efficient, and it can be improved significantly. For example, the solution can be implemented using a dynamic programming approach, which would allow it to run in O(n) time.
3. **Incorrect testing of the solution.** The solution was not tested thoroughly, and as a result, it contains several bugs. For example, the solution does not work correctly for arrays that contain duplicate elements.
4. **Incorrect submission of the solution.** The solution was not submitted correctly, and as a result, it was not graded. For example, the solution was not formatted correctly, or it was not uploaded to the correct submission server.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer may incorrectly assume that the pre-set and end-set must be disjoint. This can lead to the solution incorrectly identifying a subarray that is not contained in both the pre-set and end-set.
* The developer may incorrectly implement the dynamic programming algorithm. This can lead to the solution running in O(n^2) time, which is not efficient enough.
* The developer may incorrectly test the solution. This can lead to the solution being incorrect, even though it appears to be correct.
* The developer may incorrectly submit the solution. This can lead to the solution not being graded.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement, carefully implement the solution, thoroughly test the solution, and correctly submit the solution.

Title:
HACKEREARTH integers-only-allowed

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain a non-integer number, or the number of vertices may be less than 3. The developer should check the input format and handle incorrect input gracefully.
2. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the developer may use a brute-force algorithm that iterates over all possible points and checks if each point is inside the polygon. This algorithm is inefficient and will not work for large input sizes.
3. **Incorrect implementation**. The developer may implement the algorithm incorrectly. For example, the developer may forget to check if a point is inside the polygon or may incorrectly calculate the area of the polygon. This will result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Runtime error**. The developer may write code that runs into a runtime error. For example, the developer may allocate too much memory or may divide by zero. This will cause the program to crash.
5. **Memory leak**. The developer may write code that leaks memory. This will cause the program to use up more and more memory until it eventually crashes.
6. **Security vulnerability**. The developer may write code that is vulnerable to security attacks. For example, the developer may store passwords in plaintext or may allow users to execute arbitrary code. This could allow attackers to gain access to the system or to steal sensitive data.

Title:
ATCODER p02549 AtCoder Beginner Contest 179 - Leaping Tak

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect modular arithmetic**

When performing calculations with modulo arithmetic, it is important to be aware of the fact that the result of a calculation may not be the same as the expected result. For example, if you are working in modulo 10 and you calculate 11 + 11, the result will be 22, which is not a valid number in modulo 10. To avoid this problem, you can either use the `%` operator to find the remainder of the calculation, or you can use the `mod()` function in Python.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of mistake that can occur when programming. They happen when you forget to add or subtract one from a number, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if you are trying to calculate the number of ways to get from cell 1 to cell 10, you might forget to subtract 1 from the number of cells, which would result in an incorrect answer.

**3. Incorrect data types**

It is important to be aware of the data types that you are using when programming. For example, if you are trying to store a number as a string, you will not be able to perform mathematical operations on it. Similarly, if you are trying to store a list of numbers as a string, you will not be able to access the individual elements of the list.

**4. Uninitialized variables**

When you declare a variable in a program, it is important to initialize it with a value. If you do not initialize a variable, it will contain garbage data, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if you declare a variable `x` and do not initialize it, the value of `x` will be whatever happened to be in memory at the time that the variable was declared. This could be anything from a random number to the contents of another variable.

**5. Using the wrong algorithm**

There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve a given problem. It is important to choose the right algorithm for the problem that you are trying to solve. If you use the wrong algorithm, you may not be able to solve the problem, or you may get an incorrect answer.

Title:
ATCODER p02808 Dwango Programming Contest 6th - Cookie Distribution

Pain points:
### Possible Problems ###

* **Incorrect use of modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. This means that if you divide two numbers and then take the modulo of the result, you will get the remainder of the division. For example, 10 % 3 is 1 because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.
* **Incorrect use of factorials.** The factorial of a number is the product of all the numbers from 1 up to that number. For example, 5! is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, which is 120. When you're working with factorials, it's important to make sure that you're using the correct order of operations. For example, 5! * 3 is not the same as 3! * 5!.
* **Incorrect use of exponentiation.** Exponentiation is the operation of raising a number to a power. For example, 2^3 is 2 * 2 * 2, which is 8. When you're working with exponentiation, it's important to make sure that you're using the correct order of operations. For example, 2^3 * 4 is not the same as 2^ (3 * 4).
* **Incorrect use of the binomial coefficient.** The binomial coefficient (n, k) is the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items. For example, (5, 3) is the number of ways to choose 3 items from a set of 5 items. When you're working with binomial coefficients, it's important to make sure that you're using the correct formula.

### Possible Bugs ###

* **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when you forget to add or subtract one from a calculation. For example, if you're supposed to add 10 to a number, but you accidentally add 11, you'll have an off-by-one error.
* **Arithmetic overflow.** Arithmetic overflow occurs when a calculation results in a number that is too large to be represented by the data type you're using. For example, if you try to store the number 1000000000 in a variable that can only hold numbers up to 1000000000, you'll get an arithmetic overflow error.
* **Division by zero.** Division by zero is a mathematical operation that is undefined. This means that it's not possible to divide a number by zero. If you try to divide a number by zero, you'll get a division by zero error.
* **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.** Floating-point numbers are a type of number that can represent both positive and negative numbers, as well as decimals. However, floating-point numbers are not always accurate, and they can sometimes lead to rounding errors.

ATCODER p03081 ExaWizards 2019 - Snuke the Wizard

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input contains two integers N and Q, which represent the number of squares and the number of spells, respectively. These values can be very large, so it is important to use the correct data types to store them. In particular, N and Q should be stored as integers of type `long long`.

**2. Using incorrect indices**

The input also contains a string s, which represents the characters written on the squares. The squares are numbered from 1 to N from left to right, so the character at index i of the string s represents the character written on square i. It is important to be careful when using indices to access elements of the string s, as it is possible to access elements that are out of bounds.

**3. Not handling edge cases correctly**

The input contains a few edge cases that must be handled correctly. For example, if Q is 0, then there are no spells and the number of golems remaining is simply N. Similarly, if N is 1, then there is only one square and the number of golems remaining is always 1.

**4. Not using the correct data structures**

The problem requires keeping track of the number of golems on each square. A simple way to do this is to use a vector of size N, where the ith element of the vector represents the number of golems on square i. This data structure is easy to use and efficient.

**5. Not using efficient algorithms**

The problem can be solved in O(N + Q) time using a simple greedy algorithm. The algorithm works by iterating over the spells in order and moving the golems on the affected squares. The algorithm maintains a queue of squares that have been affected by a spell. When a golem is moved to a square that is already in the queue, the golem is removed from the queue. This ensures that each golem is only moved once.

**6. Not debugging the code correctly**

Once the code has been written, it is important to debug it carefully to ensure that it is correct. This can be done by running the code on a few small test cases and checking the output. It is also helpful to use a debugger to step through the code and watch how it works.

Title:
ATCODER p03374 AtCoder Regular Contest 096 - Static Sushi

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect understanding of the problem statement**

The problem statement is not very clear, so it is easy to make mistakes in understanding it. For example, one might think that the goal is to maximize the total nutrition taken in, when in fact it is to maximize the net nutrition taken in (i.e., the total nutrition taken in minus the total energy consumed).

**2. Incorrect implementation of the solution**

Even if the problem statement is understood correctly, it is still possible to make mistakes in implementing the solution. For example, one might forget to account for the fact that Nakahashi consumes 1 kilocalorie per meter when walking.

**3. Incorrect test cases**

It is important to test the solution thoroughly with a variety of test cases. This will help to catch any bugs in the implementation.

**4. Incorrect debugging**

If the solution does not pass all of the test cases, it can be difficult to figure out what is wrong. It is important to be systematic in debugging the solution, and to use a debugger to help track down the problem.

**5. Incorrect submission**

Once the solution is correct, it is important to submit it to the competition website correctly. This includes making sure that the code is formatted correctly and that the input and output files are named correctly.

ATCODER p03535 CODE FESTIVAL 2017 Final (Parallel) - Time Gap

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of integers. If we use an incorrect data type to store the input data, such as a string, we will get a runtime error.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The correct algorithm to solve this problem is to find the maximum absolute difference between any two elements in the list. However, if we use an incorrect algorithm, such as finding the minimum absolute difference, we will get the wrong answer.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The logic for finding the maximum absolute difference between two elements in a list is as follows:

1. Iterate through the list, keeping track of the maximum absolute difference seen so far.
2. For each element in the list, compare it to the previous element and update the maximum absolute difference if necessary.

However, if we use incorrect logic, such as only comparing the current element to the first element in the list, we will get the wrong answer.

**4. Using incorrect implementation**

The implementation of the algorithm for finding the maximum absolute difference between two elements in a list is as follows:

```
def find_max_absolute_difference(list):
  """Finds the maximum absolute difference between two elements in the list."""

  max_absolute_difference = 0
  for i in range(1, len(list)):
    absolute_difference = abs(list[i] - list[i - 1])
    if absolute_difference > max_absolute_difference:
      max_absolute_difference = absolute_difference

  return max_absolute_difference
```

However, if we use incorrect implementation, such as using the wrong comparison operator, we will get the wrong answer.

**2. Not handling the empty input case correctly**

The input may be empty. If the developer does not handle this case correctly, it may lead to a runtime error. For example, if the developer tries to access the first element of an empty list, it will cause a `IndexError`.

**3. Not handling the case where all the operators are the same correctly**

If all the operators in the input are the same, the developer may not be able to find the maximum possible evaluated value. For example, if all the operators are `+`, the developer may not be able to find the maximum possible sum of the integers.

**4. Not handling the case where the integers are all negative correctly**

If all the integers in the input are negative, the developer may not be able to find the maximum possible evaluated value. For example, if all the integers are `-1`, the developer may not be able to find the maximum possible product of the integers.

**5. Not handling the case where the integers are all positive correctly**

If all the integers in the input are positive, the developer may not be able to find the maximum possible sum of the integers. For example, if all the integers are `1`, the developer may not be able to find the maximum possible sum of the integers.

**6. Not handling the case where the integers are both positive and negative correctly**

If the integers in the input are both positive and negative, the developer may not be able to find the maximum possible absolute value of the integers. For example, if the integers are `1` and `-1`, the developer may not be able to find the maximum possible absolute value of the integers.

**7. Not handling the case where the integers are all equal correctly**

If all the integers in the input are equal, the developer may not be able to find the maximum possible product of the integers. For example, if all the integers are `1`, the developer may not be able to find the maximum possible product of the integers.

## Possible Problems

* The input data may be invalid. For example, `N` may be less than 2, or `L` may be greater than the maximum distance between two hotels.
* The input data may not be correctly formatted. For example, a query may contain two equal integers, or a query may contain an integer that is not between 1 and `N`.
* The developer may not correctly implement the two personal principles of Tak the traveler. For example, the developer may allow Tak to travel more than `L` in a single day, or the developer may allow Tak to sleep in the open.
* The developer may not correctly implement the algorithm for finding the minimum number of days that Tak needs to travel from one hotel to another.

## Possible Bugs

* The developer may forget to check the validity of the input data. This could lead to a runtime error or an incorrect answer.
* The developer may incorrectly implement the two personal principles of Tak the traveler. This could lead to an incorrect answer.
* The developer may incorrectly implement the algorithm for finding the minimum number of days that Tak needs to travel from one hotel to another. This could lead to an incorrect answer.

## How to Avoid These Problems

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input data for validity. The developer should also carefully implement the two personal principles of Tak the traveler and the algorithm for finding the minimum number of days that Tak needs to travel from one hotel to another.

Here are some specific tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use the `assert` statement to check the validity of the input data.
* Use a unit test suite to test the implementation of the two personal principles of Tak the traveler and the algorithm for finding the minimum number of days that Tak needs to travel from one hotel to another.
* Use a debugger to step through the code and verify that the two personal principles of Tak the traveler and the algorithm for finding the minimum number of days that Tak needs to travel from one hotel to another are implemented correctly.

Here are the most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly handling the input data.** The input data for this problem is given in a specific format, and it is important to make sure that the data is parsed correctly. For example, if the dimensions of the formation are not specified correctly, or if the excavation cost, oxygen cylinder capacity, or initial oxygen amount are not valid, the program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.
* **Incorrectly calculating the minimum cost.** The minimum cost to reach the deepest cell is the sum of the excavation costs for each cell that must be dug, plus the cost of replenishing oxygen in any cells that have accumulated oxygen. It is important to make sure that this calculation is done correctly, and that all of the relevant costs are taken into account.
* **Not handling all possible cases.** The problem statement specifies that there are no more than 50 cells in which oxygen has accumulated. However, it is possible that there are fewer than 50 cells in which oxygen has accumulated. The program must be able to handle this case correctly, and it must not assume that there are always 50 cells in which oxygen has accumulated.
* **Not handling the case where the oxygen cylinder runs out.** The problem statement states that the oxygen cylinder must have a capacity of at least 3 units. However, it is possible that the oxygen cylinder will run out of oxygen before the deepest cell is reached. The program must be able to handle this case correctly, and it must not assume that the oxygen cylinder will never run out of oxygen.

By following these tips, you can avoid many of the most common problems and bugs that developers encounter when solving this problem.

Title:
AIZU p00396 Playing With Stones

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of stones in each area.** The input format specifies that the first line of the input contains the number of areas, $N$. Each of the subsequent $N$ lines contains the number of white stones, $w_i$, and black stones, $b_i$, in the $i$-th area. A common mistake is to forget to add 1 to $N$ when counting the number of lines in the input. This will result in an incorrect number of stones being counted for each area.
2. **Incorrectly checking whether a player can perform an operation.** The rules of the game state that a player can only remove a white stone from an area if there are no black stones in the area. A common mistake is to forget to check this condition when determining whether a player can perform an operation. This will result in a player being able to perform an invalid operation, which could lead to an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrectly determining the winner of the game.** The rules of the game state that the winner of the game is the player who can still perform an operation. A common mistake is to forget to check this condition when determining the winner of the game. This will result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrectly handling ties.** The rules of the game do not specify what happens in the event of a tie. A common mistake is to assume that the game ends in a tie when there are no more stones in any of the areas. This is not necessarily the case, as the game could also end in a tie if both players are unable to perform an operation.
5. **Incorrectly handling errors in the input.** The input format for this problem is very specific. A common mistake is to not handle errors in the input correctly. This could lead to the program crashing or producing an incorrect answer.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the rules of the game. It is also important to test your program thoroughly to ensure that it handles all possible cases correctly.
Test inputs:
**1. Incorrectly counting the number of stones in each area.**

```
N = int(input())
ans = 0
for i in range(N):
    w, b = map(int, input().split())
    ans += w - b
print(ans)
```

This program will incorrectly count the number of stones in each area because it does not add 1 to $N$ when counting the number of lines in the input. As a result, the number of stones in each area will be incorrect, which could lead to an incorrect answer.

**2. Incorrectly checking whether a player can perform an operation.**

```
N = int(input())
ans = 0
for i in range(N):
    w, b = map(int, input().split())
    if w == 0:
        ans += b
    else:
        ans += w
print(ans)
```

This program will incorrectly check whether a player can perform an operation because it does not check whether there are any black stones in the area. As a result, a player may be able to perform an invalid operation, which could lead to an incorrect answer.

**3. Incorrectly determining the winner of the game.**

```
N = int(input())
ans = 0
for i in range(N):
    w, b = map(int, input().split())
    ans += w - b
if ans > 0:
    print(1)
else:
    print(0)
```

This program will incorrectly determine the winner of the game because it does not check whether both players are unable to perform an operation. As a result, the game could end in a tie, even if one of the players could still perform an operation.

**4. Incorrectly handling ties.**

```
N = int(input())
ans = 0
for i in range(N):
    w, b = map(int, input().split())
    ans += w - b
if ans == 0:
    print(2)
else:
    if ans > 0:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)
```

This program will incorrectly handle ties because it does not consider the possibility that the game could end in a tie if both players are unable to perform an operation. As a result, the program will always output 0 or 1, even if the game ends in a tie.

**5. Incorrectly handling errors in the input.**

```
N = int(input())
ans = 0
for i in range(N):
    w, b = map(int, input().split())
    if b > w:
        print("error")
        exit()
    ans += w - b
print(ans)
```

This program will incorrectly handle errors in the input because it does not check whether the number of black stones is greater than the number of white stones. As a result, the program will crash if the input contains an invalid value.

AIZU p01611 K-th String

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is a string, but the developer may accidentally treat it as an integer. This will cause the program to crash.

**2. Incorrect index**

The suffix array is a permutation of the integers from 1 to N. However, the developer may accidentally index the array incorrectly, which will cause the program to output incorrect results.

**3. Off-by-one error**

The suffix array is a permutation of the integers from 1 to N. However, the developer may accidentally start the permutation at 0 or end it at N+1, which will cause the program to output incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect logic**

The algorithm for finding the K-th string in lexicographic order from the suffix array is relatively straightforward. However, the developer may make a mistake in the logic, which will cause the program to output incorrect results.

**5. Runtime error**

The algorithm for finding the K-th string in lexicographic order from the suffix array is relatively efficient. However, the developer may make a mistake in the implementation, which will cause the program to run slowly or even crash.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the tournament tree.** The tournament tree is a full binary tree, so each node should have exactly two children. However, some implementations may incorrectly implement the tree with only one child, which would result in incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of games.** The number of games played in a tournament can be calculated by summing the number of games played at each level of the tree. However, some implementations may incorrectly calculate the number of games at each level, which would result in incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect handling of absent players.** The problem states that absent players do not participate in the tournament and do not count towards the number of games played. However, some implementations may incorrectly count absent players in the number of games played, which would result in incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect handling of ties.** The problem states that ties will not occur in the tournament. However, some implementations may incorrectly handle ties, which would result in incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect handling of the winner of the tournament.** The problem states that the winner of the tournament is the player who reaches the root of the tree. However, some implementations may incorrectly identify the winner of the tournament, which would result in incorrect results.

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not standard. For example, the input should be in the format of `h,w,W`, but the input in the example is `4 4 10`. This can cause the developer to misinterpret the input and make mistakes.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem is not standard. For example, the output should be in the format of `<integer>`, but the output in the example is `970`. This can cause the developer to misinterpret the output and make mistakes.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The developer may make mistakes in the calculation of the total income and total electricity bill. For example, the developer may forget to add the income from all the light bulbs or the electricity bill for all the power supplies. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may make mistakes in the logic of the program. For example, the developer may not consider all the possible cases or may use incorrect algorithms. This can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect implementation**. The developer may make mistakes in the implementation of the program. For example, the developer may use incorrect data types or may not handle errors correctly. This can lead to incorrect results or the program may crash.

Title:
AIZU p02186 Cutting Subarray

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be in the following format:

```
n q
a_1 a_2 ... a_n
k_1 x_1
...
k_q x_q
```

where `n` is the number of elements in the array, `q` is the number of rewrites, and `a_i` and `x_j` are the elements of the array and the rewrite values, respectively. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to process the input correctly and will likely produce incorrect output.

2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values should be in the following format:

```
int n, q
int a_1, a_2, ..., a_n
int k_1, x_1
...
int k_q, x_q
```

If the data type of any of the input values is incorrect, the program will not be able to process the input correctly and will likely produce incorrect output.

3. **Incorrect calculation**. The program should calculate the maximum value of the sum of the subarrays before and after each rewrite. If the calculation is incorrect, the program will not produce the correct output.

4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format should be in the following format:

```
q + 1 lines
The maximum value of the sum of the subarrays before rewriting
The maximum value of the sum of the subarrays immediately after the 1st rewrite
...
The maximum value of the sum of the subarrays immediately after the qth rewrite
```

If the output format is incorrect, the program will not produce the correct output.

5. **Other bugs**. There may be other bugs in the program that are not listed here. These bugs could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output. It is important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it is working correctly.

Title:
AIZU p02328 Largest Rectangle in a Histogram

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the stack.** The stack should be implemented as a LIFO (last in, first out) data structure. This means that the most recently pushed element should be the first element to be popped. In the following code, the stack is implemented as a FIFO (first in, first out) data structure, which will result in incorrect results.

```
def largestRectangleArea(heights):
    stack = []
    maxArea = 0
    for i in range(len(heights)):
        # Push the current element onto the stack
        stack.append(heights[i])

        # While the stack is not empty and the current element is smaller than the top element of the stack
        while stack and heights[i] < stack[-1]:
            # Pop the top element of the stack
            h = stack.pop()

            # Calculate the area of the rectangle with the current element as the height and the distance between the current element and the top element of the stack as the width
            area = h * (i - stack.index(h) - 1)

            # Update the maximum area
            maxArea = max(maxArea, area)

    # Return the maximum area
    return maxArea
```

**2. Incorrect calculation of the area of the rectangle.** The area of a rectangle is equal to the product of its height and width. In the following code, the width of the rectangle is calculated incorrectly.

```
def largestRectangleArea(heights):
    stack = []
    maxArea = 0
    for i in range(len(heights)):
        # Push the current element onto the stack
        stack.append(heights[i])

        # While the stack is not empty and the current element is smaller than the top element of the stack
        while stack and heights[i] < stack[-1]:
            # Pop the top element of the stack
            h = stack.pop()

            # Calculate the area of the rectangle with the current element as the height and the distance between the current element and the top element of the stack as the width
            area = h * (i - stack.index(h) - 1)

            # Update the maximum area
            maxArea = max(maxArea, area)

    # Return the maximum area
    return maxArea
```

The correct calculation of the width of the rectangle is as follows:

```
def largestRectangleArea(heights):
    stack = []
    maxArea = 0
    for i in range(len(heights)):
        # Push the current element onto the stack
        stack.append(heights[i])

        # While the stack is not empty and the current element is smaller than the top element of the stack
        while stack and heights[i] < stack[-1]:
            # Pop the top element of the stack
            h = stack.pop()

            # Calculate the area of the rectangle with the current element as the height and the distance between the current element and the next smaller element in the stack as the width
            area = h * (i - stack.index(h) - 1)

            # Update the maximum area
            maxArea = max(maxArea, area)

    # Return the maximum area
    return maxArea
```

**3. Incorrect use of the stack.** The stack should only be used to store the heights of the bars in the histogram. It should not be used to store any other information, such as the indices of the bars or the widths of the rectangles. In the following code, the stack is used to store the indices of the bars, which will result in incorrect results.

```
def largestRectangleArea(heights):
    stack = []
    maxArea = 0
    for i in range(len(heights)):
        # Push the index of the current element onto the stack
        stack.append(i)

        # While the stack is not empty and the current element is smaller than the top element of the stack
        while stack and heights[i] < heights[stack[-1]]:
            # Pop the top element of the stack
            j = stack.pop()

            # Calculate the area of the rectangle with the current element as the height and the distance between the current element and the top element of the stack as the width
            area = heights[j] * (i - j)

            # Update the maximum area
            maxArea = max(maxArea, area)

Title:
AIZU p02473 Difference of Big Integers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect sign handling.** When subtracting two integers, it is important to take into account the signs of both numbers. If both numbers are positive, the result will be positive. If both numbers are negative, the result will be negative. However, if one number is positive and the other is negative, the result will be the absolute value of the difference between the two numbers.
2. **Overflow errors.** When subtracting two integers, it is possible to encounter an overflow error. This occurs when the result of the subtraction is too large to be represented by the integer type being used. In this case, the result will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect use of the modulus operator.** The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. When subtracting two integers, it is important to avoid using the modulus operator, as this can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect use of the bitwise operators.** The bitwise operators (<<, >>, &, |, ^, ~) should not be used when subtracting two integers. These operators perform bitwise operations on the bits of the integers, and do not produce the correct results when subtracting two integers.
5. **Incorrect use of the comparison operators.** The comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) should not be used when subtracting two integers. These operators compare the values of the integers, and do not produce the correct results when subtracting two integers.
6. **Incorrect use of the logical operators.** The logical operators (&&, ||, !, ^) should not be used when subtracting two integers. These operators perform logical operations on the values of the integers, and do not produce the correct results when subtracting two integers.
