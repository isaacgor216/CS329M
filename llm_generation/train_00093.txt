Title:
CODECHEF cb05

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the frog jumping algorithm.** The frog may jump to any of the two adjacent vertices in one jump except from X5. This means that the frog cannot jump from X1 to X5 in one jump. However, some implementations may incorrectly allow this, resulting in an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of distinct paths.** The number of distinct paths of exactly n jumps ending at X5 is given by the following formula:

```
P(n) = P(n - 1) + P(n - 2)
```

where P(0) = 1 and P(1) = 0. Some implementations may incorrectly calculate this formula, resulting in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect handling of boundary cases.** The input may contain test cases with n < 0 or n > 100. Some implementations may not handle these boundary cases correctly, resulting in an incorrect answer or a runtime error.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer on a new line. Some implementations may output multiple lines of output, or may not output anything at all.

Title:
CODECHEF crz02

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain a number that is too large, or it may contain a string instead of a number. The developer should check the input format and handle errors appropriately.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not always correct. For example, the output may contain a number that is too large, or it may contain a string instead of a number. The developer should check the output format and handle errors appropriately.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The developer may make a mistake in the calculation of the answer. For example, the developer may forget to carry over a carry when adding two numbers, or the developer may use the wrong formula to calculate the answer. The developer should carefully check the calculation and make sure that it is correct.
4. **Incorrect use of variables**. The developer may use variables incorrectly. For example, the developer may use a variable to store the wrong type of data, or the developer may use a variable that is not initialized. The developer should carefully check the use of variables and make sure that they are used correctly.
5. **Incorrect use of functions**. The developer may use functions incorrectly. For example, the developer may call a function with the wrong arguments, or the developer may not return a value from a function. The developer should carefully check the use of functions and make sure that they are used correctly.

Title:
CODECHEF mgcrnk

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type**

The input data contains integers in the range [-2500, 2500]. However, the code below uses `int` as the data type, which can only store integers in the range [-2147483648, 2147483647]. This can lead to overflow errors when the input data contains values outside of this range.

```
def solve(N):
    # Initialize the matrix
    A = [[0 for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]

    # Read the input data
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            A[i][j] = int(input())

    # Compute the maximum possible average points
    max_avg = -2147483648
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if i == 0 or j == 0 or i == N - 1 or j == N - 1:
                continue
            avg = (A[i][j] + A[i + 1][j] + A[i][j + 1] + A[i - 1][j] + A[i][j - 1]) / 5
            if avg > max_avg:
                max_avg = avg

    return max_avg


if __name__ == '__main__':
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        print(solve(N))
```

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm below uses a brute-force approach to find the maximum possible average points. This approach is inefficient, as it requires iterating over all possible paths through the matrix. For a matrix of size N x N, this algorithm has a time complexity of O(N^4).

```
def solve(N):
    # Initialize the matrix
    A = [[0 for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]

    # Read the input data
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            A[i][j] = int(input())

    # Find the maximum possible average points
    max_avg = -2147483648
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if i == 0 or j == 0 or i == N - 1 or j == N - 1:
                continue
            for k in range(N):
                for l in range(N):
                    if i == k or j == l or i + k == N or j + l == N:
                        continue
                    avg = (A[i][j] + A[k][l]) / 2
                    if avg > max_avg:
                        max_avg = avg

    return max_avg


if __name__ == '__main__':
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        print(solve(N))
```

**3. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

The algorithm below does not handle the boundary conditions correctly. In particular, it does not consider the case where the first or last row or column of the matrix does not contain any judges. This can lead to incorrect results.

```
def solve(N):
    # Initialize the matrix
    A = [[0 for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]

    # Read the input data
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            A[i][j] = int(input())

    # Compute the maximum possible average points
    max_avg = -2147483648
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if i == 0 or j == 0 or i == N - 1 or j == N - 1:
                continue

Title:
CODECHEF recipe

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type.** The input data is a list of integers, but the developer may accidentally treat it as a string and perform string operations on it. This could lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation.** The developer may incorrectly calculate the reduced recipe. For example, they may forget to divide each ingredient by the greatest common divisor of all the ingredients. This could lead to incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one error.** The developer may accidentally miscount the number of ingredients or the number of test cases. This could lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The developer may incorrectly format the output, such as by not including enough spaces between the numbers. This could lead to the output being rejected by the grader.
5. **Memory leak.** The developer may not properly free up memory after using it. This could lead to a memory leak, which could eventually crash the program.

Title:
CODECHEF tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the good tree definition.** The definition of a good tree is not always clear, and it is important to make sure that you are implementing it correctly. For example, in the problem statement, it is not clear whether two nodes that are not adjacent in the tree must be in different subtrees. If you incorrectly implement the definition, your solution may not be correct.
2. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The problem statement states that the output may be very large, so it is important to make sure that your solution does not overflow. One way to do this is to use the `mod` operator to find the remainder when the output is divided by a large number.
3. **Incorrect use of dynamic programming.** Dynamic programming is a powerful technique that can be used to solve a variety of problems. However, it is important to use dynamic programming correctly. For example, in this problem, you need to be careful about the order in which you fill in the DP table. If you fill in the table in the wrong order, your solution may not be correct.
4. **Incorrect use of memoization.** Memoization is a technique that can be used to speed up recursive solutions. However, it is important to use memoization correctly. For example, in this problem, you need to be careful about the order in which you call the memoized function. If you call the memoized function in the wrong order, your solution may not be correct.
5. **Incorrect use of bitmasks.** Bitmasks are a powerful tool that can be used to solve a variety of problems. However, it is important to use bitmasks correctly. For example, in this problem, you need to be careful about the order in which you set and clear bits in the bitmask. If you set or clear bits in the wrong order, your solution may not be correct.
6. **Incorrect use of math.** Math is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a variety of problems. However, it is important to use math correctly. For example, in this problem, you need to be careful about the order in which you perform operations. If you perform operations in the wrong order, your solution may not be correct.

CODEFORCES 1016_D. Vasya And The Matrix

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a number that is too large or too small.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may not contain the correct number of rows or columns, or the elements in each row or column may not be in the correct order.
3. **Incorrect solution.** The solution may not find a matrix that satisfies the given constraints. For example, the solution may find a matrix that does not have the same number of rows and columns as the given matrix, or the elements in the matrix may not be the correct xor of the elements in the given rows and columns.
4. **Memory errors.** The solution may use too much memory, which can lead to the program crashing or running out of memory.
5. **Time errors.** The solution may take too long to run, which can make it impractical for use in a real-world application.
6. **Incorrect data structures.** The solution may use incorrect data structures, which can lead to incorrect results or performance problems.
7. **Incorrect algorithms.** The solution may use incorrect algorithms, which can lead to incorrect results or performance problems.
8. **Incorrect logic.** The solution may contain incorrect logic, which can lead to incorrect results or performance problems.

Possible problems and bugs:

* **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to put a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
* **Incorrect output format.** The output for this problem must be in a specific format. For example, you must print the total mass of cows that can be stolen using only one scenario on a single line, and you must not print any extra spaces or newlines.
* **Off-by-one errors.** It's easy to make an off-by-one error when calculating the total mass of cows that can be stolen using a given scenario. For example, if you forget to add the mass of the last cow in the scenario, the total mass will be incorrect.
* **Incorrect use of pointers.** Pointers can be a source of errors if they are not used correctly. For example, if you try to dereference a pointer that is not pointing to a valid memory location, the program will crash.
* **Memory leaks.** Memory leaks can occur when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
* **Race conditions.** Race conditions can occur when multiple threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results or crashing.
* **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can lead to the program being stuck in an infinite loop.
* **Stack overflows.** Stack overflows can occur when a program calls a recursive function too many times. This can lead to the program crashing.

CODEFORCES 1084_D. The Fair Nut and the Best Path

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly specified, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input format is incorrect, the program may not be able to read the input correctly and may crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input may be incorrect, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input is a string but the program expects an integer, the program may crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, which may cause the program to produce incorrect output. For example, if the program is supposed to find the maximum value in an array, but the program instead finds the minimum value, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Memory leak**. The program may not be releasing memory properly, which may cause the program to run out of memory and crash. For example, if the program creates a large array and does not free the memory when it is finished with the array, the program may eventually run out of memory and crash.
5. **Synchronization issues**. The program may not be properly synchronized, which may cause the program to produce incorrect output or crash. For example, if two threads are accessing the same data at the same time and one thread modifies the data, the other thread may see the incorrect data.
6. **Race conditions**. The program may not be properly handling race conditions, which may cause the program to produce incorrect output or crash. For example, if two threads are trying to access the same data at the same time and one thread fails, the other thread may not be able to access the data and may crash.
7. **Deadlocks**. The program may deadlock, which means that two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock and the program never makes progress. For example, if two threads are both trying to acquire a lock on the same resource, the program will deadlock.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1104_A. Splitting into digits

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is `n`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000. If the input is not in this format, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format for this problem is `k`, where `k` is the number of digits in the partition, followed by a newline, followed by the digits in the partition, separated by spaces. If the output is not in this format, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of different digits.** The number of different digits in a partition can be calculated by counting the number of unique digits in the partition. For example, the partition `[1, 2, 3]` has 3 different digits, while the partition `[1, 1, 2]` has 2 different digits. If the number of different digits is not calculated correctly, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
4. **Incorrect choice of digits for the partition.** The digits in the partition must be non-zero and must add up to `n`. If any of these conditions is not met, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
5. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm used to solve this problem must be correct in order for the program to correctly solve the problem. If the algorithm is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

CODEFORCES 1152_B. Neko Performs Cat Furrier Transform

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input is an integer, but the code uses a float variable to store it. This can lead to incorrect results.

**2. Using the wrong operator**

The problem states that the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) should be used, but the code uses the regular addition operator (`+`). This will also lead to incorrect results.

**3. Not handling the edge cases**

The problem states that the input can be 1, but the code does not handle this case correctly. This can lead to a runtime error.

**4. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The problem states that the number of operations must be no more than 40, but the code does not check this. This can lead to a runtime error.

**5. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved in O(log n) time, but the code uses a brute-force algorithm that runs in O(n) time. This can lead to a significant performance penalty.

**6. Not commenting the code**

Title:
CODEFORCES 1191_D. Tokitsukaze, CSL and Stone Game

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is:

```
The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of piles.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_1, a_2, …, a_n ≤ 10^9), which mean the i-th pile has a_i stones.
```

A developer may incorrectly parse the input format and read the number of piles as a string, or read the number of stones as a list of strings. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the number of piles**

The number of piles is the first integer in the input. A developer may incorrectly assume that the number of piles is the length of the list of stones, or the number of lines in the input file. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the number of stones**

The number of stones in each pile is the second integer in the input. A developer may incorrectly assume that the number of stones is the sum of the list of stones, or the number of characters in the line of input. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**4. Incorrect calculation of the winning player**

The winning player is the player who can make the last move. A developer may incorrectly assume that the winning player is the player who has the most stones, or the player who has the fewest stones. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**5. Incorrect handling of ties**

The problem states that "Tokitsukaze may still be able to make a valid first move. It is only necessary that there are no two piles with the same number of stones after she moves." This means that if there are two piles with the same number of stones at the beginning, Tokitsukaze can still win the game. A developer may incorrectly assume that Tokitsukaze cannot win if there are two piles with the same number of stones at the beginning. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

CODEFORCES 120_E. Put Knight!

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very strict. It allows for a variety of different inputs, but some of them may not be valid. For example, the input ```1``` could be interpreted as either a single integer ```1``` or a list with one element ```1```. If the input is not in the correct format, the program will likely crash or produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also not very strict. It allows for a variety of different outputs, but some of them may not be valid. For example, the output ```0``` could be interpreted as either the integer ```0``` or the string ```"0"```. If the output is not in the correct format, the program will likely crash or produce incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic of the program is also important. The program must be able to correctly determine which player wins, given the size of the chessboard. If the logic is incorrect, the program will likely produce incorrect output.

**4. Runtime errors**

The program must be able to run within a reasonable amount of time. If the program takes too long to run, it will likely timeout and produce incorrect output.

**5. Memory errors**

The program must not use too much memory. If the program uses too much memory, it will likely crash.

CODEFORCES 1230_B. Ania and Minimizing

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number with leading zeroes, the program may incorrectly assume that the number has no leading zeroes and output an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum possible value.** The minimum possible value of S is not always the smallest number that can be represented by n digits. For example, if S is 99999 and k is 1, the minimum possible value of S is not 00000, but 10000.
3. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the output contains a number with leading zeroes, the program may incorrectly output a number with no leading zeroes.
4. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other potential bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem, such as incorrect handling of edge cases, incorrect use of data structures, and incorrect logic.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the program thoroughly with a variety of inputs to ensure that it produces the correct output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1251_E2. Voting (Hard Version)

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect variable type**

When solving a problem, it is important to pay attention to the type of the variables used. In the following code, the variable `n` is declared as an integer, but it is used to store a string. This will cause a type error.

```
n = input()
```

**2. Off-by-one error**

An off-by-one error occurs when a programmer forgets to account for the first or last element in an array. In the following code, the programmer forgot to add 1 to the value of `n` when calculating the size of the array. This will cause the array to be one element too short.

```
n = int(input())
arr = [0] * (n - 1)
```

**3. Incorrect loop condition**

The loop condition in the following code will never be true, because the value of `i` is never incremented. This will cause the loop to run forever.

```
for i in range(n):
    pass
```

**4. Uninitialized variable**

A variable that is used before it is initialized will have an undefined value. In the following code, the variable `x` is used before it is initialized. This will cause the program to crash.

```
print(x)
```

**5. Using the wrong data type**

The following code will cause a type error, because the variable `x` is a string, but it is being used to store an integer.

```
x = "123"
print(x + 1)
```

CODEFORCES 1271_D. Portals

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect results.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correctly generated, which can lead to the program being rejected by the judge.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic of the program is incorrect, which can lead to incorrect results.
* **Memory leak:** The program does not release memory that is no longer needed, which can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
* **Time complexity:** The program takes too long to run, which can lead to the program being timed out by the judge.
* **Incorrect data structures:** The program uses data structures that are not appropriate for the problem, which can lead to incorrect results or slow performance.
* **Incorrect algorithms:** The program uses algorithms that are not appropriate for the problem, which can lead to incorrect results or slow performance.

**Here are some specific examples of problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is as follows:

```
n m k
a1 b1 c1
a2 b2 c2
...
an bn cn
u1 v1
u2 v2
...
um vm
```

where `n` is the number of castles, `m` is the number of portals, `k` is the initial size of the army, and `a1`, `b1`, `c1`, `a2`, `b2`, `c2`, ..., `an`, `bn`, `cn`, `u1`, `v1`, `u2`, `v2`, ..., `um`, `vm` are the data for each castle and portal, respectively.

If the input format is not correctly parsed, the program may not be able to read the data correctly, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input format is incorrect, the program may not be able to distinguish between the number of castles and the number of portals, which can lead to the program trying to access data that does not exist.

* **Incorrect output format:** The output format for this problem is as follows:

```
ans
```

where `ans` is the maximum sum of importance values of defended castles.

If the output format is not correctly generated, the program may not be able to output the correct answer, which can lead to the program being rejected by the judge. For example, if the output format is incorrect, the program may output the answer in the wrong format, or it may not output the answer at all.

* **Incorrect logic:** The logic of the program is incorrect if it does not correctly solve the problem. For example, the program may not correctly account for the fact that the number of warriors in the army can change after capturing a castle or using a portal.

* **Memory leak:** A memory leak occurs when the program does not release memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing. For example, if the program does not release the memory for a data structure after it is no longer needed, the program may eventually run out of memory.

* **Time complexity:** The time complexity of a program is the amount of time it takes to run. If the time complexity of a program is too high, the program may be timed out by the judge. For example, if the program uses a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem, the time complexity of the program may be exponential, which can lead to the program being timed out.

* **Incorrect data structures:** The data structures that a program uses can have a significant impact on the performance of the program. For example, if the program uses a data structure that is not appropriate for the problem, the program may run slowly. For example, if the program uses a linked list to store the data for each castle, the program may run slowly because linked lists are not as efficient as arrays.

* **Incorrect algorithms:** The algorithms that a program uses can have a significant impact on the performance of the program. For example, if the program uses an algorithm that is not appropriate for the problem, the program may run slowly. For example, if the program uses a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem, the time complexity of the program may be exponential, which can lead to the program being timed out.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1315_E. Double Elimination

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement is quite long and detailed, so it is easy to miss some important details. For example, one common mistake is to forget that the teams are numbered from 1 to 2^n, not from 0 to 2^n-1. Another common mistake is to forget that the teams are split into games by team numbers, not by random draw.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for finding the maximum number of games that include the fan's teams is quite complex, so it is easy to make mistakes in its implementation. Some common mistakes include:
    * Using the wrong data structure to store the teams.
    * Initializing the data structure incorrectly.
    * Using the wrong algorithm to find the maximum number of games.
3. **Incorrect testing of the algorithm.** It is important to test the algorithm thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. Some common mistakes in testing include:
    * Not testing the algorithm on a variety of inputs.
    * Not testing the algorithm on inputs that are likely to cause errors.
    * Not checking the output of the algorithm carefully.

By avoiding these common problems and bugs, you can increase the chances of writing a correct and efficient solution to this problem.

CODEFORCES 1359_E. Modular Stability

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulo operation.** When calculating the remainder of a division, it is important to use the correct modulo operator. For example, in C++, the modulo operator is `%`, while in Java, it is `mod`. If you use the wrong modulo operator, you will get incorrect results.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over an array, it is important to make sure that you start and end at the correct indices. For example, if you are iterating over an array of size `n`, you should start at index `0` and end at index `n - 1`. If you make an off-by-one error, you will miss some elements of the array or count them twice.
3. **Incorrect use of variables.** When writing code, it is important to use variables correctly. For example, if you are using a variable to store the number of elements in an array, you should make sure that you initialize the variable to the correct value. If you don't initialize the variable, you will get incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect use of functions.** When calling a function, it is important to make sure that you pass the correct arguments. For example, if you are calling a function that takes an array as an argument, you should make sure that you pass the array in the correct format. If you don't pass the array in the correct format, you will get incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect use of data structures.** When using a data structure, it is important to make sure that you use it correctly. For example, if you are using a linked list, you should make sure that you insert and delete elements in the correct order. If you don't use the data structure correctly, you will get incorrect results.

CODEFORCES 1443_B. Saving the City

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very strict. It allows for spaces between numbers, and it also allows for multiple spaces between numbers. This can lead to errors if the input is not formatted correctly. For example, the input "1 2 3" would be interpreted as three numbers, 1, 2, and 3, instead of the two numbers 12 and 3.

To avoid this problem, make sure that the input is formatted correctly. This means that there should be no spaces between numbers, and there should only be one space between each pair of numbers.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also not very strict. It allows for spaces between numbers, and it also allows for multiple spaces between numbers. This can lead to errors if the output is not formatted correctly. For example, the output "1 2 3" would be interpreted as three numbers, 1, 2, and 3, instead of the two numbers 12 and 3.

To avoid this problem, make sure that the output is formatted correctly. This means that there should be no spaces between numbers, and there should only be one space between each pair of numbers.

**3. Incorrect data type**

The input for this problem is a string, and the output is an integer. This means that you need to make sure that the input is converted to the correct data type before you can use it. For example, if the input is "123", you need to convert it to the integer 123 before you can use it.

To avoid this problem, make sure that you convert the input to the correct data type before you use it.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

This problem is susceptible to off-by-one errors. For example, if you are trying to find the index of the last character in a string, you might accidentally index one character too far and get the wrong answer.

To avoid this problem, make sure that you are careful when you are indexing into arrays and strings.

**5. Logic errors**

This problem is also susceptible to logic errors. For example, you might accidentally assume that a certain condition is true when it is not, or you might forget to check for a certain edge case.

To avoid this problem, make sure that you carefully check your logic and that you are not making any assumptions that are not justified.

**6. Runtime errors**

This problem can also lead to runtime errors. For example, if you try to access an element of an array that does not exist, you will get a runtime error.

To avoid this problem, make sure that you are not accessing elements of arrays that do not exist.

CODEFORCES 1493_E. Enormous XOR

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect binary representation of numbers.** The input numbers are given in binary representation, so it is important to make sure that you are correctly converting them to binary. For example, the number 10 in binary is 1010, not 1000.
2. **Incorrect use of bitwise operators.** The bitwise XOR operator (^) is used to perform the XOR operation on two numbers. For example, 10 ^ 11 = 01. Make sure that you are using the bitwise XOR operator correctly.
3. **Incorrect use of loops.** The problem requires you to find the maximum value of f(l, r) for all values of x and y satisfying l ≤ x ≤ y ≤ r. To do this, you will need to use a loop to iterate over all possible values of x and y.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem states that the binary representation of r does not contain any extra leading zeros. This means that you need to handle the case where r is equal to 0.
5. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single line containing the value of f(l, r) in binary representation without any extra leading zeros.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use a tool like [Bingo](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bingo/) to help you convert numbers to binary.
* Make sure that you understand the bitwise XOR operator before you start coding.
* Use a debugger to help you track down errors in your code.
* Test your code on a variety of input values to make sure that it is working correctly.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems that developers encounter when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1516_B. AGAGA XOOORRR

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect bitwise operation**. The bitwise XOR operation is performed on two integers, and the result is an integer. In the problem statement, it is mentioned that the array elements are less than 2^30. However, if you perform the bitwise XOR operation on two integers that are greater than 2^30, the result will be an integer that is greater than 2^30. This will cause a runtime error.
2. **Incorrect array indexing**. The problem statement states that the array has at least two elements. However, if you try to access an element in the array that is out of bounds, you will get a runtime error.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The problem statement states that Baby Ehab can make all the elements of the array equal while leaving at least two elements standing. However, if you try to make all the elements of the array equal by removing all of the elements, you will not have at least two elements remaining.
4. **Incorrect output formatting**. The problem statement states that the output should be "YES" or "NO". However, if you print the output in any other format, your solution will be incorrect.

To avoid these problems, make sure to carefully read the problem statement and understand all of the requirements. Also, be careful with your bitwise operations and array indexing. Finally, make sure to check your output formatting to make sure that it matches the requirements of the problem statement.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1543_C. Need for Pink Slips

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect calculation of the expected number of races.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. The expected number of races is equal to the sum of the probabilities of all possible drawing sequences. For example, in the first test case, the possible drawing sequences are:

    * P with a probability of 0.6;
    * CP with a probability of 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14;
    * CMP with a probability of 0.2 * 0.3 * 0.9 = 0.054;
    * CMMP with a probability of 0.2 * 0.3 * 0.1 * 1 = 0.006;
    * MP with a probability of 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14;
    * MCP with a probability of 0.2 * 0.3 * 0.9 = 0.054;
    * MCCP with a probability of 0.2 * 0.3 * 0.1 * 1 = 0.006.

So, the expected number of races is equal to 1 * 0.6 + 2 * 0.14 + 3 * 0.054 + 4 * 0.006 + 2 * 0.14 + 3 * 0.054 + 4 * 0.006 = 1.532.

2. **Incorrect handling of the volatility factor.** The volatility factor affects the probability of drawing a particular item. For example, in the first test case, the probability of drawing a Cash Slip is 0.2, but if the volatility factor is 0.1, the probability of drawing a Cash Slip is reduced to 0.2 * 0.1 = 0.02. This means that the probability of drawing a Pink Slip is increased to 1 - 0.2 - 0.02 = 0.78.

3. **Incorrect handling of the invalid items.** In the problem statement, it is stated that "if a≤ v, the probability of the item drawn becomes 0 and the item is no longer a valid item for all the further draws, reducing x by 1". This means that if the probability of drawing an item is less than or equal to the volatility factor, then the item is considered invalid and is removed from the set of valid items. For example, in the first test case, if the volatility factor is 0.1, then the Cash Slip is considered invalid and is removed from the set of valid items. This means that the probability of drawing a Pink Slip is increased to 1 - 0.2 - 0 = 0.8.

4. **Incorrect handling of the boundary cases.** The problem statement does not specify what happens if the probability of drawing a particular item is equal to the volatility factor. In this case, the developer should make a decision on how to handle the situation. For example, the developer could choose to round the probability up or down, or to use the average of the two values.

5. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.** Floating-point numbers are not always precise, and this can lead to errors in the calculation of the expected number of races. To avoid this problem, the developer should use the `round()` function to round the values to the nearest integer.

**Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:**

* **Be careful when calculating the expected number of races.** Make sure to add up the probabilities of all possible drawing sequences.
* **Be careful when handling the volatility factor.** Make sure to reduce the probability of drawing a particular item by the volatility factor.
* **Be careful when handling invalid items.** Make sure to remove invalid items from the set of valid items.
* **Be careful when handling the boundary cases.** Make sure to make a decision on how to handle situations where the probability of drawing a particular item is equal to the volatility factor.
* **Be careful when using floating-point numbers.** Make sure to use the `round()` function to round the values to the nearest integer.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs that developers encounter when solving this problem.

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format specified in the problem statement is not followed. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
* **Incorrect variable declaration:** The variables used in the program must be declared correctly. For example, if a variable is declared as an integer but is used to store a floating-point number, the program will produce incorrect output.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic used in the program must be correct. For example, if the program is supposed to find the minimum value in an array, but it instead finds the maximum value, the program will produce incorrect output.
* **Off-by-one errors:** Off-by-one errors occur when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to the program skipping over or including an incorrect element, which will result in incorrect output.
* **Memory leaks:** Memory leaks occur when a programmer allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
* **Race conditions:** Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program producing incorrect output or crashing.
* **Deadlocks:** Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, but neither thread is willing to release the resource first. This can lead to the program running indefinitely or crashing.

**To avoid these problems,:**

* Carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand the input and output formats.
* Declare variables correctly and use them consistently throughout the program.
* Test your program thoroughly to make sure it produces the correct output for all possible inputs.
* Use a debugger to help you find and fix errors in your program.
* Use a memory profiler to help you identify and fix memory leaks.
* Use a thread checker to help you identify and fix race conditions and deadlocks.

CODEFORCES 335_C. More Reclamation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly identifying the current player.** The problem states that the cities alternately choose a cell to reclaim, so the current player is the one who did not choose the last cell. However, it is easy to make a mistake and incorrectly identify the current player. For example, if the last cell was reclaimed by city A, then city B is the current player, not city A.
2. **Not considering all possible outcomes.** When making a decision about which cell to reclaim, it is important to consider all possible outcomes. For example, if city A is considering reclaiming cell (r, c), it must also consider the possibility that city B will reclaim cell (r - 1, 3 - c), (r, 3 - c), or (r + 1, 3 - c).
3. **Making suboptimal decisions.** Even if a player considers all possible outcomes, they may still make a suboptimal decision. For example, a player may choose to reclaim a cell that leaves their opponent with a better chance of winning.
4. **Implementing the algorithm incorrectly.** The algorithm for solving this problem is relatively simple, but it is easy to make mistakes when implementing it. For example, a programmer may forget to check for boundary conditions or may incorrectly calculate the number of possible outcomes.
5. **Not testing the code thoroughly.** It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. This includes testing the code with a variety of input values and checking for both expected and unexpected results.

CODEFORCES 474_D. Flowers

Pain points:
 * For K = 2 and length 5 Marmot can eat, for example, (RRRRR), (RWWWW), (WRRRR), (WRWWR), (WWRWR), (WWWRR) and (WWWWR).
 1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain two integers t and k, where 1 ≤ t, k ≤ 105. However, a developer may accidentally write t and k as strings, or may forget to put a space between them. This would cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of ways to eat flowers**. The number of ways to eat flowers can be calculated using the following formula:

```
ways = (bi - ai + 1) * (bi - ai + 2) / 2
```

However, a developer may accidentally divide by 2 instead of 2, or may forget to add 1 to both ai and bi. This would result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect modulo operation**. The number of ways to eat flowers is a large number, so it must be modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7). A developer may accidentally forget to do this modulo operation, or may use the wrong modulus. This would result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that each line should contain the number of ways to eat flowers modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7). However, a developer may accidentally print the number of ways to eat flowers without modulo, or may print the number of ways to eat flowers in a different format. This would result in an incorrect output.
5. **Other bugs**. There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, a developer may accidentally use the wrong variable names, or may forget to initialize variables. These bugs can all lead to incorrect results.

```

This code incorrectly calculates the number of ways to eat flowers by dividing by 2 instead of 2. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**Incorrect modulo operation**

```
t, k = map(int, input().split())

CODEFORCES 498_C. Array and Operations

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the array or the integers in the array.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. For example, if you are using an integer array to store the values of the array, but the values are actually floating-point numbers, then you will get incorrect results when you try to perform operations on the array.
2. **Not using the correct data type for the indices of the array.** The indices of the array should be integers, not strings or characters. If you use the wrong data type for the indices, then you will get incorrect results when you try to access the elements of the array.
3. **Using the wrong algorithm to solve the problem.** There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. The best algorithm to use will depend on the specific details of the problem. If you use the wrong algorithm, then you will get incorrect results.
4. **Making a mistake in your implementation of the algorithm.** Even if you choose the right algorithm to solve the problem, you still need to implement it correctly. If you make a mistake in your implementation, then you will get incorrect results.
5. **Not handling special cases correctly.** There are a few special cases that you need to handle correctly when solving this problem. For example, what happens if the array is empty? What happens if there are no good pairs? If you don't handle these special cases correctly, then you will get incorrect results.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

* **Use the right data types for the array and the integers in the array.** Make sure that the array is a primitive array, and that the integers in the array are of the correct data type.
* **Use the correct data type for the indices of the array.** The indices of the array should be integers, not strings or characters.
* **Choose the right algorithm to solve the problem.** There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. The best algorithm to use will depend on the specific details of the problem.
* **Implement the algorithm correctly.** Make sure that you understand the algorithm before you try to implement it. Be careful to avoid making mistakes in your implementation.
* **Handle special cases correctly.** Make sure that you handle all of the special cases correctly. This will help you avoid getting incorrect results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 549_A. Face Detection

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of faces.** A developer may incorrectly count the number of faces in an image by not considering all possible combinations of letters. For example, in the image below, there are two faces: one in the top left corner and one in the bottom right corner. However, if the developer only considers the top left corner, they will incorrectly count only one face.

```
    f
   ac
   e
```

2. **Not considering overlapping faces.** A developer may incorrectly count the number of faces in an image by not considering that faces can overlap. For example, in the image below, there are two faces: one in the top left corner and one in the bottom right corner. However, if the developer only considers the top left corner, they will incorrectly count only one face.

```
    f
   ac
   e
```

3. **Using an inefficient algorithm.** A developer may use an inefficient algorithm to count the number of faces in an image. For example, they could use a brute force algorithm that checks every possible combination of letters in the image. This algorithm would be very slow for large images.

4. **Using incorrect data types.** A developer may use incorrect data types to store the image data. For example, they could use strings to store the image data, which would take up a lot of memory.

5. **Not handling errors correctly.** A developer may not handle errors correctly when reading the input data or writing the output data. For example, they could ignore errors when reading the input data or they could write incorrect output data.

6. **Not testing the code correctly.** A developer may not test their code correctly, which could lead to bugs being introduced into the production code. For example, they could only test the code on small images, which would not catch bugs that would occur on large images.

Title:
CODEFORCES 575_C. Party

Pain points:
1. **Memory limit exceeded.** The input matrix is of size $N \times N$, where $N$ is a relatively large number (up to 20). This means that the matrix will take up a lot of memory. To avoid this problem, we can use a sparse matrix representation, where only the non-zero entries are stored.
2. **Incorrect matching of people with clubs.** The problem statement states that "half of the people should go clubbing on Friday and the other half on Saturday". This means that we need to match $N / 2$ people with clubs on Friday and $N / 2$ people with clubs on Saturday. To ensure that we do this correctly, we can use a greedy algorithm.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the sum of happiness.** The sum of happiness is calculated by summing the happiness of all the people who are matched with clubs. To avoid errors, we need to make sure that we only include the people who are actually matched with clubs in the calculation.
4. **Incorrect output.** The output should be a single integer, which represents the maximum sum of happiness possible. To ensure that we output the correct value, we need to make sure that we calculate the sum of happiness correctly and that we cast the result to an integer.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. The developer may accidentally create a dense matrix representation of the input matrix, which will take up too much memory.
2. The developer may incorrectly match people with clubs, for example, by matching more than $N / 2$ people with clubs on Friday or Saturday.
3. The developer may incorrectly calculate the sum of happiness, for example, by including people who are not actually matched with clubs in the calculation.
4. The developer may incorrectly output the result, for example, by casting the sum of happiness to a floating-point number instead of an integer.

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving problems. It is important to carefully read the problem statement and make sure that your algorithm is correct.
2. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The data structures that you use to solve the problem should be appropriate for the task at hand. For example, if you are working with strings, you should use a string data structure rather than a list.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** These are errors that occur when you forget to add or subtract one from a calculation. This can be a very difficult bug to find, so it is important to be careful when writing your code.
4. **Memory leaks.** Memory leaks occur when you allocate memory that you do not free. This can eventually lead to your program running out of memory and crashing. It is important to be aware of memory leaks and to fix them as soon as possible.
5. **Incorrect input handling.** It is important to make sure that your program handles invalid input correctly. For example, if a user enters a string that is too long, your program should handle this gracefully and not crash.

By following these tips, you can avoid many of the most common problems and bugs that developers encounter when solving problems.

CODEFORCES 690_A2. Collective Mindsets (medium)

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of brains**

The minimum number of brains required for Heidi to survive is the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to half the number of attendees. For example, if there are 10 attendees, the minimum number of brains required is 6.

**2. Using the wrong data type**

The number of attendees can be very large, so it is important to use a data type that can store large integers. For example, the `int` data type can only store integers up to 2^31-1, which is not enough for this problem. The `long` data type can store integers up to 2^63-1, which is enough for this problem.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The naive algorithm for finding the minimum number of brains is to iterate over all possible values of the number of brains and check if each value is greater than or equal to half the number of attendees. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(N), which is too slow for this problem.

A more efficient algorithm is to use binary search. Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half until the minimum value is found. The time complexity of binary search is O(log N), which is much faster than the naive algorithm.

**4. Incorrect error handling**

If the number of attendees is 1, then the minimum number of brains is 0. However, if the number of attendees is 0, then the minimum number of brains is undefined. It is important to handle this case correctly.

**5. Using incorrect input**

The input for this problem is a single integer. It is important to make sure that the input is valid. For example, the input should not be a negative number or a non-integer.

**6. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code to make sure that it works correctly. This can be done by creating test cases and checking that the code produces the correct output.

 **Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format of the problem is very specific. Make sure that you read the problem statement carefully and parse the input correctly.
* **Incorrect implementation of the dynamic programming solution:** The dynamic programming solution to this problem is relatively straightforward, but there are a few common mistakes that people make. Make sure that you understand the algorithm carefully and that your implementation is correct.
* **Incorrect rounding of floating-point numbers:** The output of this problem should be a real number with an absolute error of at most 10^-4. Make sure that you are rounding your floating-point numbers correctly to ensure that your output is correct.
* **Time complexity:** The dynamic programming solution to this problem has a time complexity of O(n^2). Make sure that your implementation is efficient enough to pass the time limit.
* **Memory usage:** The dynamic programming solution to this problem has a memory usage of O(n^2). Make sure that your implementation does not use too much memory, or it will be rejected by the checker.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that people have encountered when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** One common mistake is to forget to add a newline character to the end of the input. This will cause the input parser to fail.
* **Incorrect implementation of the dynamic programming solution:** One common mistake is to forget to update the values of the DP table when a new request is processed. This will cause the output to be incorrect.
* **Incorrect rounding of floating-point numbers:** One common mistake is to round floating-point numbers to the wrong number of decimal places. This will cause the output to be incorrect.
* **Time complexity:** One common mistake is to use an inefficient algorithm to solve the problem. This will cause the solution to time out.
* **Memory usage:** One common mistake is to use too much memory in your solution. This will cause the solution to be rejected by the checker.

CODEFORCES 757_E. Bash Plays with Functions

Pain points:
```
1. **Incorrect implementation of the fibonacci formula.** The fibonacci formula is often implemented incorrectly, resulting in incorrect results. For example, the following code will not produce the correct results:

```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```

The correct implementation of the fibonacci formula is as follows:

```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a = 0
        b = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b
```

2. **Using the wrong modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) is often used incorrectly, resulting in incorrect results. For example, the following code will not produce the correct results:

```
n = 100
r = 100
print(n % r)
```

The correct way to use the modulo operator is to use it with the same base as the numbers being divided. In this case, the base is 100, so we should use the modulo operator with the same base:

```
n = 100
r = 100
print(n % r)
```

3. **Using the wrong data type.** The data type of the numbers being used is often incorrect, resulting in incorrect results. For example, the following code will not produce the correct results:

```
n = 100
r = 100
print(n // r)
```

The correct way to use the division operator is to use it with the same data type as the numbers being divided. In this case, the data type is integers, so we should use the integer division operator:

```
n = 100
r = 100
print(n // r)
```

4. **Not using the correct algorithm.** The fibonacci algorithm is a recursive algorithm, which means that it calls itself multiple times. This can be inefficient, especially for large values of n. A more efficient algorithm for computing the fibonacci numbers is the Binet formula:

```
fib(n) = ((1 + sqrt(5)) ** n - (1 - sqrt(5)) ** n) / (2 ** n * sqrt(5))
```

5. **Not using the correct data structures.** The data structures used to store the fibonacci numbers can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. For example, using a list to store the fibonacci numbers is inefficient, as it requires O(n) time to access the nth fibonacci number. A more efficient data structure for storing the fibonacci numbers is a dynamic array, which allows for O(1) access to the nth fibonacci number.

6. **Not handling errors correctly.** The fibonacci algorithm can throw errors if the input is invalid. For example, if the input n is negative, the algorithm will throw a ValueError exception. It is important to handle these errors correctly, so that the program does not crash.

7. **Not using unit tests.** Unit tests are an important way to ensure that your code is correct. Unit tests should be written for each function in your program, and they should test all possible inputs and outputs. By writing unit tests, you can catch bugs early and prevent them from causing problems in production.

8. **Not using continuous integration.** Continuous integration is a process that automatically builds and tests your code every time you make a change. This can help you to catch bugs early and prevent them from causing problems in production.

Title:
CODEFORCES 967_E. Big Secret

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the bitwise XOR operation.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The bitwise XOR operation is performed by taking the bits of two numbers and performing an exclusive OR on each bit. This means that if the bits are the same, the result will be 0, and if the bits are different, the result will be 1. For example, the bitwise XOR of 0 and 1 is 1, and the bitwise XOR of 1 and 1 is 0.
2. **Incorrect use of the unordered multiset data structure.** The unordered multiset data structure stores a collection of elements without any order. This means that the elements can be accessed in any order, and the order of the elements does not matter. When using the unordered multiset data structure, it is important to make sure that the elements are unique. If two elements are the same, the unordered multiset will only store one of them. This can lead to incorrect results if the elements are not unique.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the sorting algorithm.** The sorting algorithm is used to arrange the elements of a data structure in a specific order. There are many different sorting algorithms, and the choice of which algorithm to use depends on the specific data structure and the requirements of the application. When implementing a sorting algorithm, it is important to make sure that the algorithm is efficient and that it produces the correct results.
4. **Incorrect use of the recursion function.** The recursion function is a function that calls itself. This can be used to solve problems that are recursive in nature. When using the recursion function, it is important to make sure that the function terminates and that it does not produce any errors.
5. **Incorrect handling of the edge cases.** The edge cases are the special cases that are not covered by the normal logic of the program. When writing a program, it is important to make sure that the edge cases are handled correctly. If the edge cases are not handled correctly, the program may not work as expected.
6. **Incorrect use of the global variables.** The global variables are variables that are accessible from anywhere in the program. This can be useful for sharing data between different parts of the program. However, it is important to use the global variables correctly. If the global variables are not used correctly, the program may not work as expected.
7. **Incorrect use of the pointers.** The pointers are variables that store the address of another variable. This can be useful for accessing data that is stored in another part of the memory. However, it is important to use the pointers correctly. If the pointers are not used correctly, the program may not work as expected.
8. **Incorrect use of the exceptions.** The exceptions are used to handle errors that occur during the execution of the program. This can be useful for handling errors that are not expected. However, it is important to use the exceptions correctly. If the exceptions are not used correctly, the program may not work as expected.
9. **Incorrect use of the debugging tools.** The debugging tools are used to help find errors in the program. This can be useful for finding errors that are difficult to find. However, it is important to use the debugging tools correctly. If the debugging tools are not used correctly, the program may not work as expected.

**2. Using an incorrect data structure.** The data structure used to store the array can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. For example, using a linked list to store the array will be much slower than using a vector.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. However, not all algorithms are created equal. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. It is important to choose the algorithm that is best suited for the problem at hand.

**4. Incorrect input validation.** The input to the algorithm must be validated to ensure that it is correct. If the input is not validated, it can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer may make an off-by-one error when calculating the coordinates of the triangle vertices. For example, the developer may add 1 to a number when it should be subtracted, or the developer may subtract 1 from a number when it should be added. The developer should carefully check the calculations to make sure that there are no off-by-one errors.
5. **Floating-point errors**. The developer may encounter floating-point errors when calculating the coordinates of the triangle vertices. For example, the developer may round a number to the wrong number of digits, or the developer may use a floating-point number when an integer is required. The developer should carefully check the calculations to make sure that there are no floating-point errors.

HACKEREARTH little-vaishnavi-and-plywood-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The variable `M` and `K` are declared as integers, but the input is given as strings. This will cause a type error.
2. **Incorrect loop condition:** The loop condition `i <= M` will never be satisfied, because `M` is always less than or equal to 5. This will cause the loop to never iterate.
3. **Incorrect calculation:** The calculation of the maximum number of jumps is incorrect. The correct calculation is `5 * (K + 1)`.
4. **Incorrect output format:** The output should be a single integer, not a newline-separated list of integers.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def main():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        M, K = map(int, input().split())
        print(5 * (K + 1))

Pain points:
1. The input format is not clear. Is the first line of each test case the number of elements in the array? Or is it the number of test cases?
2. The output format is not clear. Should the output be the number of unique elements in the array? Or should it be the sum of the unique elements in the array?
3. The code is not efficient. It uses a nested loop to iterate over all the elements in the array. This can be very inefficient for large arrays.
4. The code does not handle duplicate elements in the array correctly.
5. The code does not handle negative numbers in the array correctly.

HACKEREARTH scheduling-of-task

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not specified.** The problem statement does not specify the input format. This could lead to confusion for developers who are trying to solve the problem.
2. **The output format is not specified.** The problem statement does not specify the output format. This could lead to confusion for developers who are trying to solve the problem.
3. **The problem is not well-defined.** The problem statement does not clearly define what it means to "minimize the maximum amount by which a task's completion time overshoots its deadline". This could lead to different interpretations of the problem, which could result in different solutions.
4. **The problem is too difficult.** The problem is asking the developer to find an optimal solution to a scheduling problem. This type of problem is often difficult to solve, and there is no guarantee that a developer will be able to find an optimal solution.
5. **The problem is not interesting.** The problem is not very interesting or engaging. This could lead to developers losing interest in the problem and giving up on trying to solve it.

Title:
HACKEREARTH tape-december-easy-easy-medium

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement is not very clear, so it is possible that a developer may misunderstand what is being asked. For example, a developer may think that the goal is to make the sum of all the stickiness factors at least D, when in reality the goal is to make the sum of any subarray of size K at least D.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution to this problem is not trivial, so it is possible that a developer may make a mistake in their implementation. For example, a developer may forget to update the values of the stickiness factors after each augment operation, or they may not correctly calculate the minimum number of augment operations needed.
3. **Incorrect test cases.** The test cases provided for this problem are not very comprehensive, so it is possible that a developer may not catch a bug in their implementation. For example, the test cases do not include any cases where the sum of the stickiness factors is less than D, or where the sum of the stickiness factors in any subarray of size K is less than D.
4. **Incorrect debugging process.** If a developer does encounter a bug in their implementation, it is possible that they may not be able to debug it correctly. For example, a developer may not be able to identify the source of the bug, or they may not be able to come up with a solution to fix the bug.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. **Read the problem statement carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked.** If you are not sure what the problem is asking, ask for clarification.
2. **Develop a clear and concise solution to the problem.** Make sure your solution is well-structured and easy to follow.
3. **Test your solution thoroughly with a variety of test cases.** Make sure your solution works for all possible inputs.
4. **Debug your solution carefully if you encounter a bug.** Make sure you identify the source of the bug and come up with a solution to fix it.

Title:
HACKEREARTH will-rick-survive-or-not-2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be a single line containing an integer t, followed by a newline, followed by n space-separated integers, followed by a newline. For example, `3
5
2 4 2 5 6
4
2 2 2 2
2
1 2`.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single line containing either `Rick now go and save Carl and Judas` or `Goodbye Rick`, followed by a newline. For example, `Rick now go and save Carl and Judas
Goodbye Rick
2`.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic for determining whether Rick survives or not is incorrect. For example, the following logic is incorrect:

```
def will_rick_survive(n, dis):
  # Check if Rick can reload his gun in time.
  if n > 6:
    return "Goodbye Rick"

  # Check if any walker is able to reach Rick.
  for i in range(n):
    if dis[i] <= 6:
      return "Goodbye Rick"

  # Rick survives.
  return "Rick now go and save Carl and Judas"
```

This logic is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that walkers move forward by 1 meter every second. For example, if there are 5 walkers at a distance of 2 meters from Rick, then he will only be able to kill 3 of them before they reach him.

4. **Memory leaks**. The code may leak memory if it does not properly free up the memory that it has allocated. For example, the following code leaks memory:

```
def will_rick_survive(n, dis):
  # Allocate a list to store the walkers.
  walkers = []

  # Add the walkers to the list.
  for i in range(n):
    walkers.append(dis[i])

  # Free up the memory that was allocated for the list.
  del walkers

  # Return whether Rick survives or not.
  return "Rick now go and save Carl and Judas"
```

The `del walkers` statement frees up the memory that was allocated for the list, but it does not free up the memory that was allocated for the individual walkers. This means that the memory for the individual walkers will continue to be allocated even after the function has finished executing.

5. **Race conditions**. The code may exhibit race conditions if it is not properly synchronized. For example, the following code may exhibit a race condition:

```
def will_rick_survive(n, dis):
  # Check if Rick can reload his gun in time.
  if n > 6:
    return "Goodbye Rick"

  # Check if any walker is able to reach Rick.
  for i in range(n):
    if dis[i] <= 6:
      return "Goodbye Rick"

  # Rick survives.
  return "Rick now go and save Carl and Judas"

# Start a new thread.
thread = threading.Thread(target=will_rick_survive, args=(n, dis))

# Start the thread.
thread.start()

# Wait for the thread to finish.
thread.join()
```

The `will_rick_survive` function may be called multiple times from different threads. This could lead to a race condition where two threads are trying to access the same data at the same time. This could cause the data to be corrupted or inconsistent.

Title:
ATCODER p02631 AtCoder Beginner Contest 171 - Red Scarf

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a list of integers. If we use the wrong data type to store the input data, it may cause problems when we perform operations on the data. For example, if we use a string to store the input data, we will not be able to perform mathematical operations on the data.

**2. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement specifies that N is even. If we do not handle this edge case, our code will not work for inputs where N is odd.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The problem statement states that the xor of the integers written on the scarfs except the scarf of Snuke Cat i is a_i. This means that we can find the integer written on the scarf of Snuke Cat i by performing the xor operation on a_i and the sum of all the other integers written on the scarfs. However, if we do not perform the xor operation correctly, we will not get the correct answer.

**4. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved in O(N) time. However, if we use an inefficient algorithm, our code will run slowly.

**5. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code to make sure that it works correctly. This can be done by creating test cases and running the code on them. If the code does not work correctly, we can debug it to find the problem.

ATCODER p02762 AtCoder Beginner Contest 157 - Friend Suggestions

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly specified. For example, the input format does not specify the number of friendships and blockships.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correctly specified. For example, the output format does not specify the number of friend candidates for each user.
3. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is not correctly parsed. For example, the input data is not parsed as integers.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program is incorrect. For example, the program does not correctly calculate the number of friend candidates for each user.
5. **Incorrect implementation**. The program is not correctly implemented. For example, the program contains syntax errors or runtime errors.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to correctly parse the input data and use the correct data types. The logic of the program should be carefully verified to ensure that it is correct. Finally, the program should be correctly implemented to avoid syntax errors and runtime errors.

ATCODER p02897 AtCoder Beginner Contest 142 - Odds of Oddness

Pain points:
1. **Using the wrong data type.** The input `N` is an integer, so it should be stored in an integer variable. If you store it in a floating-point variable, you may get incorrect results.
2. **Using the wrong formula.** The probability that `a` is odd is `1 / 2`. If you use the wrong formula, you may get incorrect results.
3. **Not handling the special case of `N = 1` correctly.** When `N = 1`, the probability that `a` is odd is 1. If you don't handle this case correctly, you may get incorrect results.
4. **Not using the correct rounding method.** When printing the output, you need to use the correct rounding method to ensure that your output is accurate to within 10^-6.
5. **Not using the correct test cases.** When testing your code, you need to use a variety of test cases to ensure that it is correct. This includes test cases with small values of `N`, large values of `N`, and values of `N` that are divisible by 2.

Title:
ATCODER p03032 AtCoder Beginner Contest 128 - equeue

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem states that you can perform at most K operations on D, chosen from the following, at most K times (possibly zero). This means that you can perform the same operation multiple times, as long as you don't exceed the total number of allowed operations.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution should take into account the constraints on the input values. For example, the values of the jewels should be between -10^7 and 10^7.
3. **Incorrect testing of the solution.** The solution should be tested on a variety of input values, including both valid and invalid inputs. This will help to ensure that the solution is correct and robust.
4. **Incorrect documentation of the solution.** The solution should be well-documented, so that other developers can understand how it works. This includes providing a detailed explanation of the algorithm, as well as any assumptions that the solution makes.
5. **Incorrect submission of the solution.** The solution should be submitted in the correct format, and it should be accompanied by any necessary files (such as a readme file or a test suite).

By following these tips, you can help to avoid common problems and bugs when solving programming problems.

Title:
ATCODER p03173 Educational DP Contest - Slimes

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is given as integers, but the problem asks us to find the minimum possible total cost incurred. This means that we need to use a data type that can store very large integers. If we use a data type that is too small, we may get an overflow error.

**2. Not considering the edge cases**

The problem states that there are at least 2 slimes. However, we need to make sure that we handle the case where there are only 2 slimes correctly. If we don't, we may get an incorrect answer.

**3. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem can be solved using dynamic programming. However, if we use the wrong algorithm, we may get an incorrect answer or an TLE.

**4. Not handling the input data correctly**

The input data is given in a specific format. We need to make sure that we parse the input data correctly. If we don't, we may get an incorrect answer.

**5. Not testing your code**

Pain points:
**Possible Problems and Bugs**

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input format is `N M A_1 B_1`, then the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input may not be correct, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is `N M A_1 B_1`, where `N` and `M` are integers and `A_1` and `B_1` are strings, then the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the algorithm does not take into account all of the constraints, then the program may not be able to find the correct answer.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. The implementation of the algorithm may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the algorithm is implemented in a language that does not support the necessary data structures or algorithms, then the program may not be able to find the correct answer.
5. **Incorrect testing**. The program may not be tested correctly, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program is only tested on a small number of inputs, then it may not be able to find the correct answer on all inputs.

**How to avoid these problems and bugs**

1. **Follow the input format strictly**. Make sure that the input format is strictly followed, so that the program can parse the input correctly.
2. **Use the correct data type**. Make sure that the data type of the input is correct, so that the program can parse the input correctly.
3. **Use the correct algorithm**. Make sure that the algorithm used to solve the problem is correct, so that the program can find the correct answer.
4. **Implement the algorithm correctly**. Make sure that the implementation of the algorithm is correct, so that the program can find the correct answer.
5. **Test the program correctly**. Make sure that the program is tested correctly, so that it can find the correct answer on all inputs.

Title:
ATCODER p03475 AtCoder Beginner Contest 084 - Special Trains

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect variable type**

The input format specifies that the number of stations `N` is an integer, but the following code incorrectly defines `N` as a float:

```
N = float(input())
```

This will cause the code to crash when it tries to read the first line of input.

**2. Incorrect variable name**

The code uses the variable name `C` to store the number of stations, which is incorrect because `C` is already used to store the travel time between two stations. This will cause the code to produce incorrect results.

**3. Missing semicolon**

The following code is missing a semicolon after the `print` statement:

```
print(ans)
```

This will cause the code to crash when it tries to print the output.

**4. Unbalanced parentheses**

The following code has unbalanced parentheses:

```
ans = (S[i] // F[i]) * F[i] + C[i]
```

This will cause the code to crash when it tries to evaluate the expression.

**5. Incorrect operator precedence**

The following code uses the incorrect operator precedence:

```
ans = (S[i] // F[i]) * F[i] + C[i]
```

The correct operator precedence is `(S[i] // F[i]) * F[i] + C[i]`.

**6. Off-by-one error**

The following code has an off-by-one error:

```
for i in range(N):
    if i == 0:
        ans = S[i]
    else:
        ans = min(ans, (S[i] // F[i]) * F[i] + C[i])
```

The correct code should be:

```
for i in range(N):
    if i == 0:
        ans = S[i]
    else:
        ans = min(ans, (S[i] - 1) // F[i] * F[i] + C[i])

Title:
ATCODER p03796 AtCoder Beginner Contest 055 - Training Camp

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input N can be as large as 10^5, so we need to use a data type that can store integers that large. If we use an integer data type, we may get an overflow error.

**2. Using the wrong modulo operator**

The output should be modulo 10^9+7. If we use the wrong modulo operator, the output may not be correct.

**3. Not using the right algorithm**

The problem can be solved using the following algorithm:

```
power = 1
for i in range(1, N + 1):

ATCODER p03964 AtCoder Beginner Contest 046 - AtCoDeer and Election Report

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is specified as follows:

```
N
T_1 A_1
T_2 A_2
:
T_N A_N
```

However, if the input format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the input is `1 2 3 4`, the program will crash because the number of ratios is not equal to `N`.

**2. Incorrect assumption**

The problem statement states that `T_i and A_i (1≦i≦N) are coprime`. However, if this assumption is not true, the program may produce incorrect output. For example, if the input is `3 4 2 1`, the program will produce incorrect output because `3` and `4` are not coprime.

**3. Incorrect calculation**

The program must correctly calculate the minimum possible total number of votes obtained by Takahashi and Aoki. For example, if the input is `3 4 2 1`, the program must correctly calculate that the minimum possible total number of votes is `10`.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output format is specified as follows:

```
The minimum possible total number of votes obtained by Takahashi and Aoki
```

However, if the output format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the output is `10`, the program will crash because the output does not contain the text `The minimum possible total number of votes obtained by Takahashi and Aoki`.

Title:
AIZU p00055 Sequence

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect type of input data.** The input data is a real number, but the developer may accidentally read it as an integer. This will lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the sum.** The sum of the terms of a sequence can be calculated using the following formula:

```
S(n) = a1 + a2 + ... + an
```

where a1 is the first term of the sequence, a2 is the second term, and so on. However, the developer may forget to add the first term to the sum, or may add it twice. This will also lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect rounding of the output.** The output should be rounded to an error of 0.000001 or less. The developer may accidentally round the output to a larger or smaller value, which will also lead to incorrect results.
4. **Other bugs.** There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the developer may use the wrong formula to calculate the sum, or may make a mistake in the code. These bugs can all lead to incorrect results.

 **Possible Problems and Bugs**

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined. For example, the input may contain spaces between numbers, or it may contain numbers that are not between 0 and 6. The program should be able to handle these cases gracefully.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not strictly defined. The program should be able to output the correct answer in a variety of formats, such as "true", "True", "1", and "yes".
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program should be able to correctly determine whether a given net is proper or not. This is a non-trivial problem, and there are a number of ways to approach it. The program should be robust to errors in the input data, and it should be able to handle all possible cases.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program should not leak memory. This is a common problem in C++, and it can be difficult to track down. The program should be carefully written to avoid memory leaks.
5. **Race conditions**. The program should not be susceptible to race conditions. This is a problem that can occur when multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time. The program should be written in a way that ensures that race conditions do not occur.
6. **Deadlocks**. The program should not deadlock. This is a problem that can occur when two threads are waiting for each other to finish, and neither one can continue. The program should be written in a way that avoids deadlocks.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program should not have any security vulnerabilities. This is a critical issue, and the program should be carefully written to avoid any potential security risks.
8. **Performance issues**. The program should be efficient and should not have any performance bottlenecks. This is especially important for programs that will be used on large datasets. The program should be carefully written to optimize performance.

**Possible Solutions**

1. **Validate the input format**. The program should first validate the input format to ensure that it is correct. This can be done by checking for the following:
    * The input is a 5x5 grid of numbers.
    * The numbers in the grid are between 0 and 6.
    * There are no spaces between the numbers.
2. **Output the correct answer**. The program should output the correct answer in a variety of formats, such as "true", "True", "1", and "yes".
3. **Implement the correct logic**. The program should be able to correctly determine whether a given net is proper or not. This can be done by checking for the following:
    * The sum of the numbers on opposite faces is always 7.
    * No two faces are marked with the same number.
    * The net is a valid representation of a cube.
4. **Avoid memory leaks**. The program should not leak memory. This can be done by carefully managing the memory that is allocated and deallocated.
5. **Avoid race conditions**. The program should not be susceptible to race conditions. This can be done by ensuring that only one thread at a time can access the shared data.
6. **Avoid deadlocks**. The program should not deadlock. This can be done by ensuring that no two threads are waiting for each other to finish.
7. **Avoid security vulnerabilities**. The program should not have any security vulnerabilities. This can be done by carefully writing the program to avoid any potential security risks.
8. **Optimize performance**. The program should be efficient and should not have any performance bottlenecks. This can be done by carefully writing the program to optimize performance.

Title:
AIZU p01719 Invest Master

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrectly calculating the maximum profit.** The maximum profit is the difference between the highest stock price and the lowest stock price. A developer may incorrectly calculate the maximum profit by comparing the stock prices on different days, or by not taking into account the cost of buying and selling stocks.
* **Not considering all possible trading strategies.** A developer may only consider a few possible trading strategies, such as buying and holding stocks, or buying and selling stocks at the same time. However, there may be other trading strategies that can generate a higher profit.
* **Not implementing the solution efficiently.** The solution to this problem can be implemented in a time-efficient manner using dynamic programming. A developer may implement the solution inefficiently, which could lead to a timeout.

**Additional tips:**

* To avoid incorrectly calculating the maximum profit, it is important to keep track of the highest and lowest stock prices. This can be done using a two-dimensional array, where the first dimension represents the day and the second dimension represents the stock price.
* To consider all possible trading strategies, it is important to enumerate all possible combinations of buying and selling stocks. This can be done using a recursive algorithm.
* To implement the solution efficiently, it is important to use dynamic programming. Dynamic programming allows the solution to be computed in a time-efficient manner by reusing previously computed values.

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrectly representing the tree structure.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. It is important to make sure that the tree is represented correctly, as this will affect the correctness of the output.
* **Incorrectly computing the depth of a node.** The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node. It is important to correctly compute the depth of each node, as this will affect the output.
* **Incorrectly identifying the type of a node.** The type of a node can be either "root", "internal node", or "leaf". It is important to correctly identify the type of each node, as this will affect the output.
* **Incorrectly printing the output.** The output should be printed in the following format:

```
node id: parent = p, depth = d, type, [c1...ck]
```

It is important to make sure that the output is formatted correctly, as this will affect the readability of the output.

**Additional tips:**

* It is helpful to draw a picture of the tree to help you understand the structure.
* It is helpful to write out the pseudocode for your solution before you start coding. This will help you to identify any potential problems in your solution.
* It is helpful to test your solution on small examples before you submit it to the judge. This will help you to catch any errors in your solution.

 **Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrectly initializing the state.** The state should be initialized to all OFF bits.
* **Incorrectly handling masks.** The masks should be interpreted correctly and used to set, clear, or flip the appropriate bits in the state.
* **Incorrectly implementing the test, all, any, none, count, and val operations.** These operations should be implemented correctly according to the problem statement.
* **Incorrectly handling queries.** The queries should be processed correctly and the appropriate output should be printed.
* **Incorrectly handling errors.** The program should handle errors gracefully and the output should be correct even if there are errors in the input.

Here are some specific examples of problems and bugs that could occur:

* The state could be initialized to all ON bits instead of all OFF bits. This would cause all of the test, all, any, none, count, and val operations to return incorrect results.
* A mask could be interpreted incorrectly and used to set, clear, or flip the wrong bits in the state. This would also cause the test, all, any, none, count, and val operations to return incorrect results.
* The test, all, any, none, count, and val operations could be implemented incorrectly. This would also cause the output to be incorrect.
* The program could crash or produce incorrect output if there are errors in the input.

To avoid these problems and bugs, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements. It is also important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly.
