Title:
CODECHEF cm03

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect modulo operator**

The modulo operator (%) is used to find the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 = 1, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.

In this problem, we need to find the size of the power set of a set. The power set of a set is the set of all subsets of that set. For example, the power set of the set {1, 2, 3} is {{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}.

The size of the power set of a set with n elements is 2^n. So, the answer to this problem is 2^n % 10^9 + 7.

However, some developers might mistakenly use the modulo operator (%) instead of the exponentiation operator (**). This would result in an incorrect answer.

For example, if n = 3, then 2^n = 8. However, 8 % 10^9 + 7 = 8, which is not the correct answer.

**2. Using incorrect data types**

Another common mistake that developers make is using incorrect data types. For example, they might try to store the size of the power set in a variable of type int, when it should actually be stored in a variable of type long long.

This would result in an overflow error, because the size of the power set can be larger than the maximum value that can be stored in an int variable.

**3. Not using the correct algorithm**

The correct algorithm for finding the size of the power set of a set is the following:

1. Initialize a variable count to 1.
2. For each element in the set, do the following:
    1. Increment count by count * 2.
3. Return count % 10^9 + 7.

This algorithm works by multiplying the size of the power set of the set without the current element by 2, and then adding 1. This is because the power set of a set with n elements is the union of the power sets of the set with n - 1 elements and the set with n elements.

**4. Not using the correct modular arithmetic**

When working with modulo arithmetic, it is important to remember that the following rules apply:

* a % b == c if and only if a == (b * c) + r for some integer r.
* (a + b) % c == (a % c + b % c) % c.
* (a - b) % c == (a % c - b % c) % c.
* a * b % c == ((a % c) * (b % c)) % c.

These rules can be used to simplify calculations and avoid overflow errors.

**5. Not using the correct data structures**

The correct data structures for storing the power set of a set are the following:

* A set of sets, where each set contains the elements of the power set that are subsets of a given set.
* A bit vector, where each bit represents whether or not an element is in the power set.

These data structures can be used to efficiently store and access the power set of a set.

Title:
CODECHEF flow009

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input is a list of integers, but the developer may mistakenly use a list of strings. This will cause errors when trying to perform mathematical operations on the list.
2. **Incorrect mathematical operations**. The developer may mistakenly use the wrong mathematical operator, or may forget to perform an operation altogether. This will result in incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may have a logical error in their code, such as a missing condition or an incorrect comparison. This will cause the program to produce incorrect output or to crash.
4. **Incorrect error handling**. The developer may not handle errors correctly, such as by not catching exceptions or by not providing informative error messages. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
5. **Incorrect input validation**. The developer may not validate the input correctly, such as by not checking for invalid values or by not checking for the correct type of input. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.

Title:
CODECHEF ppnum

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulo operation.** The modulo operator (%) should be used to ensure that the output is within the range [0, 10^9+7]. For example, `1000000000 % 1000000007` should be used instead of `1000000000`.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of digits.** The number of digits in a number can be calculated using the following formula: `floor(log10(n)) + 1`. For example, the number of digits in 12345 is `floor(log10(12345)) + 1 = 4`.
3. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The sum of the goodness of all integers from L to R can be very large. For example, if L = 1 and R = 10^9, the sum of the goodness of all integers from L to R is `10^9 * 10 = 10^10`. In this case, the modulo operator (%) should be used to ensure that the output is within the range [0, 10^9+7].

Title:
CODECHEF summath

Pain points:
**1. Integer overflow**

The problem states that `N` can be as large as `1000000000`, which is a very large number. If we naively compute the sum of all the multiples of 10 less than or equal to `N`, we may get an integer overflow error.

**2. Off-by-one error**

When computing the sum of the multiples of 10 less than or equal to `N`, we need to make sure that we include `N` in the sum. Otherwise, we will get an incorrect answer.

**3. Incorrect logic**

We need to make sure that we correctly compute the sum of the multiples of 10 less than or equal to `N`. For example, if `N` is 10, we need to add 10 to the sum, not 9.

**4. Using the wrong data type**

We need to make sure that we use the correct data type to store the sum of the multiples of 10. If we use an integer data type, we may get an integer overflow error. We should use a long long data type to store the sum.

CODEFORCES 100_H. Battleship

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not correct. For example, the input may not contain a single integer on the first line, or the number of boards may be less than 1 or greater than 10.
2. **Incorrect board format.** The board format is not correct. For example, the board may not contain 10 lines, or the length of each line may not be 10, or the board may contain characters other than 0 and *.
3. **Incorrect ship placement.** The ships may be placed incorrectly. For example, a ship may be placed outside the board, or a ship may overlap with another ship.
4. **Incorrect ship size.** The ships may not have the correct size. For example, a ship may be larger than 4, or a ship may be smaller than 1.
5. **Incorrect ship orientation.** The ships may not be oriented correctly. For example, a ship may be oriented diagonally.

To avoid these problems, make sure that the input format is correct, the board format is correct, the ships are placed correctly, the ships have the correct size, and the ships are oriented correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1033_E. Hidden Bipartite Graph

Pain points:
### Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Invalid input:** The input may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers, non-integers, or strings. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect logic:** The program may contain logical errors, such as using the wrong variable or operator, or making a mistake in the algorithm. This can also cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
3. **Memory leaks:** The program may allocate memory that it does not free, which can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
4. **Race conditions:** The program may access shared data without the proper synchronization, which can lead to incorrect results or even program crashes.
5. **Security vulnerabilities:** The program may be vulnerable to attacks such as buffer overflows or SQL injection, which can allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the program or system.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully test the program with a variety of input values and to use a robust programming style. It is also important to be aware of the potential security implications of the program and to take steps to mitigate any risks.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1056_C. Pick Heroes

Pain points:
### Possible Problems

* **Incorrect input format.** The input format is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading it. For example, you might accidentally miss a comma or a newline, or you might misread a number. This could lead to your program crashing or giving incorrect results.
* **Incorrect output format.** The output format is also very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when writing it. For example, you might forget to print a newline or flush the output buffer. This could lead to your program crashing or giving incorrect results.
* **Incorrect logic.** The logic of your program is the most important part, and it's easy to make a mistake here. For example, you might forget to check for special pairs of heroes, or you might not choose the best possible hero. This could lead to your program giving incorrect results.
* **Memory errors.** If your program uses too much memory, it will crash. This can happen if you allocate too much memory, or if you don't free memory that you're no longer using.
* **Time errors.** If your program takes too long to run, it will be disqualified. This can happen if your program is inefficient, or if it gets stuck in an infinite loop.

### Bugs

* **Off-by-one errors.** These are errors where you accidentally increment or decrement a variable by one too many or too few times. This can lead to your program crashing or giving incorrect results.
* **Index errors.** These are errors where you try to access an element of an array or list that doesn't exist. This can lead to your program crashing or giving incorrect results.
* **Null pointer errors.** These are errors that occur when you try to dereference a null pointer. This can lead to your program crashing.
* **Arithmetic errors.** These are errors that occur when you perform an arithmetic operation that results in an invalid value. This can lead to your program crashing or giving incorrect results.
* **Logic errors.** These are errors that occur when your program's logic is incorrect. This can lead to your program giving incorrect results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1078_D. Chattering

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**. The input should be a single integer n, followed by a line with n integers r_1, ..., r_n.
2. The output format is not correct. The output should be a line with n integers, i-th of them should equal the number of seconds that is needed for all parrots to start chattering if the i-th parrot is the first to start.
3. The program does not work for all test cases. For example, the program does not work for the following test case:
```
4
1 1 4 1
```
The output of the program should be `2 2 1 2`, but the program outputs `1 1 4 1`.
4. The program is inefficient. The time complexity of the program is O(n^2). A more efficient solution would have a time complexity of O(n).
5. The program uses too much memory. The program uses O(n) space. A more efficient solution would use O(1) space.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Make sure that you understand the input format and output format correctly.
* Test your program on a variety of test cases, including some that are not in the problem statement.
* Use a debugger to help you find bugs in your program.
* Use a compiler that has optimizations enabled to help you improve the performance of your program.
* Use a memory profiler to help you find memory leaks in your program.

CODEFORCES 1099_D. Sum in the tree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the number of vertices is not a single integer, or the parent of a vertex is not a single integer.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not strictly followed. For example, the output is not a single integer.

**3. Incorrect tree structure**

The tree structure is not correct. For example, a vertex has two parents or a vertex has no parent.

**4. Incorrect values**

The values of the vertices are not correct. For example, a value is negative or a value is greater than 10^9.

**5. Inconsistent values**

The values of the vertices are inconsistent. For example, the sum of the values of all vertices on the path from a vertex to the root is not equal to the value of the vertex.

**6. Unsolvable problem**

There is no way to restore the values of the vertices such that the sum of the values of all vertices is minimized. For example, the values of all vertices are erased.

CODEFORCES 111_C. Petya and Spiders

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always strictly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may be separated by different characters.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over a list or array, it is easy to make a mistake and access an element that is one index off from the intended one. This can lead to incorrect results or even a crash.
3. **Indexing errors.** When accessing elements of a list or array, it is important to make sure that the index is within the bounds of the list or array. Otherwise, you may get an error or a corrupted value.
4. **Arithmetic errors.** When performing arithmetic operations, it is important to make sure that the operands are of the same type and that the results are within the expected range. Otherwise, you may get an incorrect result or a crash.
5. **Logic errors.** When writing code, it is important to make sure that the logic is correct. This means that the code should do what it is supposed to do, and that it should not have any unexpected side effects.
6. **Memory errors.** When allocating memory, it is important to make sure that you release it when you are finished with it. Otherwise, you may run out of memory and your program will crash.
7. **Synchronization errors.** When multiple threads are accessing shared data, it is important to make sure that the data is accessed in a consistent way. Otherwise, you may get incorrect results or even a crash.
8. **Security vulnerabilities.** When writing code, it is important to make sure that it is secure. This means that the code should not be vulnerable to attacks such as buffer overflows, denial of service attacks, or SQL injection attacks.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1146_H. Satanic Panic

Pain points:
**1. Sorting the points by x-coordinate**

This is a common mistake that many people make when solving this problem. Sorting the points by x-coordinate will not give you the correct answer, because it is possible for two points to have the same x-coordinate but different y-coordinates. For example, the points (0, 0) and (0, 1) would be sorted together, even though they do not form a pentagram.

**2. Not considering all possible permutations of the points**

Another common mistake is to only consider the permutations of the points where the first point is (0, 0). This is not enough, because there are many other ways to arrange the points to form a pentagram. For example, the points (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), and (0, -1) also form a pentagram.

**3. Using the wrong formula to calculate the number of pentagrams**

The formula for calculating the number of pentagrams is:

```
N = (n - 4)! / 2! * 3!
```

where n is the number of points. However, this formula is only valid if the points are all distinct. If there are any duplicate points, the formula will give you the wrong answer.

**4. Not handling the case where there are no pentagrams**

It is possible that there are no pentagrams in the given set of points. In this case, you should return 0.

**5. Not using the right data structures**

You will need to use a data structure to store the points in the given set. A simple array will not be enough, because you will need to be able to quickly find the points that are closest to each other. A better data structure would be a priority queue, which allows you to quickly find the smallest or largest element in the queue.

**6. Not using the right algorithms**

You will need to use some efficient algorithms to solve this problem. A brute-force algorithm will not be fast enough. A better algorithm would be to use a divide-and-conquer approach.

**7. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed. You can test your code by generating random sets of points and checking that your code returns the correct answer.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain two integers, n and m. However, if the input contains fewer than two integers, or if any of the integers is not a valid integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect array values**. The input format specifies that the second line should contain n space-separated integers, a1, a2, ..., an. However, if the input contains fewer than n integers, or if any of the integers is not a valid integer, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect array indexing**. The program assumes that the array is indexed from 1 to n. However, if the input contains an integer that is less than 1 or greater than n, the program will crash.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of operations**. The program must calculate the minimum number of operations required to make the array non-decreasing. However, if the program does not correctly calculate this number, the output will be incorrect.
5. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the program should print one integer: the minimum number of operations required to make the array non-decreasing. However, if the program prints anything other than an integer, or if the integer is not the correct value, the output will be incorrect.

Pain points:
1. **Inaccuracy of input data.** The input data may contain errors, such as a number with more than 5 digits after the decimal point, or a number that is not an integer. The developer should check the input data for errors and handle them appropriately.
2. **Incorrect rounding.** The developer should round the numbers to the nearest integer, but not to the nearest multiple of 1. For example, the number 4.5 should be rounded to 4, not to 5.
3. **Incorrect output.** The developer should output the rounded numbers in the same format as the input data, with exactly 5 digits after the decimal point.
4. **Incorrect solution.** The developer's solution may not find a valid sequence of rounded numbers that satisfies the given constraints. The developer should check their solution carefully and make sure that it is correct.
5. **Time complexity.** The developer's solution should be efficient enough to solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time. The time complexity of the solution should be O(n), where n is the number of numbers in the input data.
6. **Space complexity.** The developer's solution should not use too much memory. The space complexity of the solution should be O(n), where n is the number of numbers in the input data.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1266_H. Red-Blue Graph

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is given in the form of strings. However, some of the values may be integers. If the developer does not convert the strings to integers, the program will produce incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect logic**

The problem statement is not very clear about the exact meaning of "the first time this configuration appears". A developer may misinterpret the statement and write incorrect code.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

The developer may forget to add 1 to the time when the token reaches the vertex n. This will result in incorrect results.

**4. Undefined behavior**

The problem statement does not specify what happens if the token reaches a vertex that does not have any outgoing arcs. A developer may assume that the token stops moving, but this is not necessarily the case. The program may crash or produce incorrect results.

**5. Memory leaks**

The developer may not free the memory that is allocated during the execution of the program. This may lead to memory leaks and eventually to the program crashing.
Test inputs:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    vector<vector<int>> graph(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        int b, r;
        cin >> b >> r;
        graph[b - 1].push_back(i + 1);
        graph[r - 1].push_back(i + 1);
    }

    int q;
    cin >> q;

    for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
        int v, t;
        cin >> v >> t;

        int time = 0;
        vector<bool> active(n, true);
        active[v - 1] = false;

        while (true) {
            if (time == t) {
                cout << time << endl;
                break;
            }

            int next = graph[v - 1][active[v - 1] ? 0 : 1];

Title:
CODEFORCES 1288_C. Two Arrays

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulo operation.** When calculating the final answer, it is important to use the modulo operation correctly. For example, the following code would produce the wrong answer:

```
ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        ans += (a[i] * b[j]) % MOD
print(ans)
```

The correct code would be:

```
ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        ans += (a[i] * b[j]) % MOD
print(ans % MOD)
```

2. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over arrays, it is important to be careful not to make off-by-one errors. For example, the following code would produce the wrong answer:

```
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        if a[i] < b[j]:
            ans += 1
print(ans)
```

The correct code would be:

```
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i, n):
        if a[i] < b[j]:
            ans += 1
print(ans)
```

3. **Incorrect use of data structures.** When solving problems involving arrays, it is important to use the correct data structures. For example, the following code would produce the wrong answer:

```
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
for i in range(len(a)):
    print(a[i] * b[i])
```

The correct code would be:

```
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
for i in range(len(a)):
    print(a[i] * b[i])
```

4. **Incorrect use of mathematical formulas.** When solving problems involving math, it is important to use the correct formulas. For example, the following code would produce the wrong answer:

```
n = 10
m = 5
ans = n * m
print(ans)
```

The correct code would be:

```
n = 10
m = 5
ans = n ** m
print(ans)
```
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect modulo operation.**

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
MOD = 10**9+7
ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i, n):
        ans += (i * j) % MOD
print(ans % MOD)
```

2. **Off-by-one errors.**

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i, n):
        if a[i] < b[j]:
            ans += 1
print(ans)
```

3. **Incorrect use of data structures.**

```
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
for i in range(len(a)):
    print(a[i] * b[i])
```

4. **Incorrect use of mathematical formulas.**

```
n = 10
m = 5
ans = n * m
print(ans)
```
Title:
CODEFORCES 130_C. Decimal sum

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line of the input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the size of the array. Next n lines contain the elements of the array, one per line. Each element is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect array size**. The input format specifies that the first line of the input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the size of the array. If the array size is not within the specified range, the program will not be able to correctly process the array and will produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect array elements**. The input format specifies that the elements of the array are integers between 1 and 100, inclusive. If any of the array elements is not within the specified range, the program will not be able to correctly process the array and will produce incorrect output.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating through the array, it is important to make sure that the index of the current element is correct. An off-by-one error can occur when the index is incremented or decremented incorrectly, which can result in the program skipping or repeating elements of the array.
5. **Arithmetic errors**. When performing arithmetic operations on the elements of the array, it is important to make sure that the operations are performed correctly. An arithmetic error can occur when the operands of an operation are not of the same type, or when the operation is not supported by the programming language.
6. **Memory errors**. When allocating memory for the array, it is important to make sure that enough memory is allocated. A memory error can occur when the amount of memory allocated is not enough to store all of the elements of the array.
7. **Logic errors**. When writing the code to calculate the sum of the elements of the array, it is important to make sure that the logic is correct. A logic error can occur when the code is not written correctly, which can result in the program producing incorrect output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1419_A. Digit Game

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very well-defined. It is not clear what happens if the input contains invalid characters, or if the number of digits in the input does not match the number of digits specified in the first line. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also not very well-defined. It is not clear what happens if the output contains invalid characters, or if the output does not match the number of matches specified in the first line. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic for this problem is not very straightforward. It is not immediately obvious how to determine who will win the game, given the number of digits in the number and the positions of the odd and even digits. This could lead to the program making incorrect decisions and producing incorrect output.

**4. Incorrect implementation**

The implementation of this problem is not very efficient. It uses a lot of nested loops, which can slow down the program significantly. This could lead to the program taking a long time to run, or even crashing.

**5. Incorrect testing**

Title:
CODEFORCES 1437_A. Marketing Scheme

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The problem states that `l` and `r` are integers, but the solution code uses `float` for them. This will cause errors when comparing `l` and `r`.
2. **Incorrect logic.** The solution code checks if `l` is less than `r`. However, the problem states that `l` and `r` are inclusive, so `l` should be equal to or less than `r`.
3. **Off-by-one error.** The solution code checks if `(r mod a) >= a / 2`. However, this check is incorrect because it does not account for the case where `r mod a` is equal to `a / 2`.
4. **Incorrect output.** The solution code prints `YES` if `(r mod a) >= a / 2`. However, the problem states that the output should be `YES` if `(x mod a) >= a / 2` for **all** values of `x` in the range `l` to `r`.
5. **Uncaught exception.** The solution code throws an `ArithmeticException` when `a == 0`. This exception should be caught and handled appropriately.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use the correct variable type for `l` and `r`.
* Make sure to check if `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
* Be careful with off-by-one errors.
* Make sure to account for all possible cases when checking if `(x mod a) >= a / 2`.
* Catch and handle exceptions appropriately.

1. **Incorrect data type for input.** The input is a list of integers, but the developer may accidentally parse it as a list of strings. This will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator.** The program should compare the length of two strings, but the developer may accidentally use the == operator instead of the > operator. This will cause the program to output the wrong answer.
3. **Off-by-one error.** The program should find the longest common substring, but the developer may accidentally start counting from the second character instead of the first. This will cause the program to output the wrong answer.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The program should find the longest common substring, but the developer may accidentally use a different algorithm. This will cause the program to output the wrong answer.
5. **Memory leak.** The program should free up memory after it is finished using it, but the developer may accidentally forget to do this. This will cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
6. **Race condition.** The program should be thread-safe, but the developer may accidentally make it non-thread-safe. This could cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
7. **Security vulnerability.** The program should not allow malicious users to exploit it, but the developer may accidentally introduce a security vulnerability. This could allow malicious users to gain access to the program's data or control the program's execution.

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect data type:** The data type of the input values is not correctly specified, which can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one errors:** The developer may accidentally miss or add one element to/from the data structure, which can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect logic:** The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the algorithm, which can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Memory leaks:** The developer may not properly free up memory that is allocated during the execution of the program, which can lead to memory leaks and eventually cause the program to crash.
6. **Race conditions:** The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data between multiple threads, which can lead to race conditions and incorrect results.
7. **Security vulnerabilities:** The developer may make a mistake in the security of the program, which can allow attackers to exploit the program and gain unauthorized access to the system.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format, data types, and logic of the algorithm. It is also important to use a memory leak detector and a race condition detector to identify and fix any potential problems. Finally, it is important to perform security testing to identify and fix any potential security vulnerabilities.

CODEFORCES 397_D. On Sum of Fractions

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program's logic. For example, if the input contains a non-integer number, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The program may not be able to correctly handle data of the wrong type. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. These are errors that occur when the program's logic is one step off. For example, if the program is supposed to find the largest prime number less than or equal to a given number, but it only finds the largest prime number less than the given number, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Infinite loops**. These are errors that occur when the program enters a loop that never terminates. For example, if the program is supposed to find the sum of all the integers from 1 to 100, but it does not have a condition to stop the loop, the program will run forever.
5. **Memory leaks**. These are errors that occur when the program allocates memory that it does not free. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions**. These are errors that occur when two or more parts of the program try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program producing incorrect output or crashing.
7. **Deadlocks**. These are errors that occur when two or more parts of the program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish because it is waiting for the other. This can eventually lead to the program running out of time and crashing.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. These are errors that can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or its data. For example, if the program does not properly validate user input, an attacker could send the program malicious input that could be used to execute arbitrary code on the system.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program's output. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input may not be correct, which may lead to errors in the program's output. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the program's logic is incorrect by one unit. For example, if the program is supposed to print the first 100 numbers, but it prints the first 99 numbers instead, this is an off-by-one error.
4. **Index errors**. Index errors occur when the program accesses an element of an array or list that is out of bounds. For example, if the program tries to access the 10th element of an array that only has 9 elements, this is an index error.
5. **Logic errors**. Logic errors occur when the program's logic is incorrect. For example, if the program is supposed to find the maximum value in an array, but it returns the minimum value instead, this is a logic error.
6. **Memory errors**. Memory errors occur when the program allocates too much or too little memory. For example, if the program allocates an array that is too large, this may lead to a memory leak.
7. **Synchronization errors**. Synchronization errors occur when multiple threads try to access the same data at the same time. For example, if two threads try to update the same variable at the same time, this may lead to data corruption.

Title:
CODEFORCES 446_C. DZY Loves Fibonacci Numbers

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the Fibonacci sequence**

The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers. For example, the Fibonacci sequence is:

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
```

To implement the Fibonacci sequence, we can use a recursive function that takes the index of the number in the sequence as an input and returns the value of that number. The function would be defined as follows:

```
def fibonacci(n):
  """Returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence."""

  if n < 2:
    return n
  else:
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```

However, this implementation of the Fibonacci sequence is not efficient because it is recursive. Each time the function is called, it has to call itself again, which can lead to a stack overflow if the sequence is long.

A more efficient way to implement the Fibonacci sequence is to use an iterative function. An iterative function is a function that does not use recursion. Instead, it uses a loop to iterate through the sequence of numbers. The iterative implementation of the Fibonacci sequence is as follows:

```
def fibonacci(n):
  """Returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence."""

  a, b = 0, 1
  for i in range(n):
    a, b = b, a + b
  return a
```

This implementation of the Fibonacci sequence is much more efficient than the recursive implementation because it does not use recursion.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the sum of the elements in a range**

To calculate the sum of the elements in a range, we can use the following formula:

```
sum = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[n - 1]
```

where a is the array of elements and n is the number of elements in the array.

However, if the array is not sorted, then we need to take care to add the elements in the correct order. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, then the sum of the elements is `10`. However, if the array is `[4, 3, 2, 1]`, then the sum of the elements is `10`.

To correctly calculate the sum of the elements in a range, we can use the following algorithm:

1. Sort the array.
2. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0.
3. Iterate through the array, starting from the beginning.
4. Add the current element to the sum.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the end of the array is reached.
6. Return the value of the variable `sum`.

**3. Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic**

Modulo arithmetic is a mathematical operation that returns the remainder of a division. For example, if we divide 10 by 3, the remainder is 1. The modulo operator is denoted by the symbol `%`.

When using modulo arithmetic, it is important to remember that the result of the operation is always less than the modulus. For example, if we divide 10 by 3, the remainder is 1, which is less than 3.

It is also important to remember that the modulo operator is commutative. This means that the order of the operands does not matter. For example, 10 % 3 is the same as 3 % 10.

**4. Incorrect use of the bitwise operators**

The bitwise operators are a set of operators that perform operations on individual bits. The most common bitwise operators are the AND operator (`&`), the OR operator (`|`), and the XOR operator (`^`).

When using the bitwise operators, it is important to remember that they operate on individual bits. This means that the result of the operation will be a bit string, not a number.

It is also important to remember that the bitwise operators are commutative. This means that the order of the operands does not matter. For example, `a & b` is the same as `b & a`.

**5. Incorrect use of the conditional operator**

The conditional operator is a ternary operator that takes three operands. The first operand is a condition, the second operand is the value to return if the condition is true, and the third operand is the value to return if the condition is false.


Test inputs:
**Incorrect implementation of the Fibonacci sequence**

```
def fibonacci(n):

```

**Incorrect calculation of the sum of the elements in a range**

```
def sum_range(a, l, r):
  """Returns the sum of the elements in the range [l, r]."""

  sum = 0
  for i in range(l, r + 1):
    sum += a[i]
  return sum
```

**Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic**

```
a = 10

CODEFORCES 468_D. Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.** This is the most common mistake that programmers make when solving this problem. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that computes the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. In this problem, we can use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to compute the distances between all pairs of vertices in the tree. However, it is important to note that the Floyd-Warshall algorithm only works for graphs that are undirected. If the tree is directed, then the Floyd-Warshall algorithm will not give the correct answer.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the topological sort algorithm.** The topological sort algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that orders the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that all of the edges point from earlier vertices to later vertices. In this problem, we can use the topological sort algorithm to find a topological ordering of the vertices in the tree. This ordering will allow us to find the lexicographically smallest permutation of the vertices. However, it is important to note that the topological sort algorithm only works for DAGs. If the tree is not a DAG, then the topological sort algorithm will not give the correct answer.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum possible value of the described sum.** The maximum possible value of the described sum is the sum of the distances between all pairs of vertices in the tree. However, it is important to note that this sum is not always achievable. In some cases, there may be no permutation of the vertices such that the sum of the distances between all pairs of vertices is equal to the maximum possible value.
4. **Incorrect output of the lexicographically smallest permutation.** The lexicographically smallest permutation of the vertices is the permutation that comes first in lexicographic order. However, it is important to note that there may be multiple permutations that are lexicographically smallest. In this case, the output should be any one of the lexicographically smallest permutations.
5. **Incorrect formatting of the output.** The output of the program should be in the following format:

```
<maximum possible value of the described sum>
<lexicographically smallest permutation of the vertices>
```

The maximum possible value of the described sum should be a single integer. The lexicographically smallest permutation of the vertices should be a list of integers, where each integer represents the position of a vertex in the permutation. The integers in the list should be separated by spaces.
Test inputs:
**Program inputs that validate whether an implementation meets each of the requirements:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm:**

```
n = int(input())

graph = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
for _ in range(n - 1):
    u, v, w = map(int, input().split())
    graph[u - 1][v - 1] = w
    graph[v - 1][u - 1] = w

for k in range(n):
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            graph[i][j] = min(graph[i][j], graph[i][k] + graph[k][j])

print(sum(graph[i][i] for i in range(n)))
```

This program will not work because it does not correctly implement the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm requires that the graph be undirected, but this program does not check for this. As a result, the program will give incorrect results for directed graphs.

2. **Incorrect implementation of the topological sort algorithm:**

```
n = int(input())

graph = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
for _ in range(n - 1):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    graph[u - 1][v - 1] = 1
    graph[v - 1][u - 1] = 1

def topological_sort(graph):
    result = []
    stack = [0]
    visited = [False] * n
    while stack:
        u = stack.pop()
        visited[u] = True
        for v in range(n):
            if graph[u][v] == 1 and not visited[v]:
                stack.append(v)
    result.append(u + 1)
    for v in range(n):
        if not visited[v]:
            return []
    return result

print(sum(graph[i][i] for i in range(n)))
print(*topological_sort(graph))
```

This program will not work because it does not correctly implement the topological sort algorithm. The topological sort algorithm requires that the graph be a directed acyclic graph (DAG), but this program does not check for this. As a result, the program will give incorrect results for graphs that are not DAGs.

3. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum possible value of the described sum:**

```
n = int(input())

graph = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
for _ in range(n - 1):
    u, v, w = map(int, input().split())
    graph[u - 1][v - 1] = w
    graph[v - 1][u - 1] = w

print(sum(graph[i][i] for i in range(n)))
```

This program will not work because it does not correctly calculate the maximum possible value of the described sum. The maximum possible value of the described sum is the sum of the distances between all pairs of vertices in the tree. However, this sum is not always achievable. In some cases, there may be no permutation of the vertices such that the sum of the distances between all pairs of vertices is equal to the maximum possible value.

4. **Incorrect output of the lexicographically smallest permutation:**

```
n = int(input())

graph = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
for _ in range(n - 1):
    u, v, w = map(int, input().split())
    graph[u - 1][v - 1] = w
    graph[v - 1][u - 1] = w

print(sum(graph[i][i] for i in range(n)))
print(*sorted(range(n)))
```

This program will not work because it does not correctly output the lexicographically smallest permutation. The lexicographically smallest permutation is the permutation that comes first in lexicographic order. However, this program does not sort the permutation before outputting it. As a result, the output of the program may not be the lexicographically smallest permutation.

5. **Incorrect formatting of the output:**

```
n = int(input())

graph = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

Title:
CODEFORCES 514_D. R2D2 and Droid Army

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always strictly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number with a decimal point, the program may interpret it as a float instead of an integer.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The data type of the input values may not be what the program expects. For example, if the input contains a string, the program may try to convert it to an integer, which will result in an error.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over an array or list, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one element. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Indexing errors.** When accessing elements of an array or list, it is important to make sure that the index is valid. For example, trying to access the element at index 100 in an array with only 10 elements will result in an error.
5. **Logic errors.** The logic of the program may be incorrect, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program is supposed to find the maximum value in an array, but it accidentally finds the minimum value instead, the results will be incorrect.
6. **Memory errors.** The program may allocate too much or too little memory, which can lead to errors. For example, if the program allocates too much memory, it may run out of memory and crash. If the program allocates too little memory, it may not be able to store all of the data it needs, which can lead to errors.
7. **Synchronization errors.** When multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is important to make sure that the data is synchronized. If not, the threads may overwrite each other's data, which can lead to errors.
8. **Deadlocks.** When two threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, it is possible for them to deadlock. This means that neither thread can progress, and the program will eventually crash.
9. **Race conditions.** When two threads are trying to access the same data at the same time, it is possible for one thread to see an inconsistent view of the data. This can lead to errors.
10. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program may contain security vulnerabilities, which can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system.

CODEFORCES 631_C. Report

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always strictly followed, which can lead to errors in the program's output. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The data type of the input values must be specified correctly. For example, if the input values are strings, but the program expects them to be integers, the program will crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors occur when the programmer forgets to account for the first or last element in an array. For example, if the programmer is trying to iterate over an array of size n, but they start at index 0 instead of index 1, they will miss the first element in the array.
4. **Indexing errors.** Indexing errors occur when the programmer tries to access an element in an array using an invalid index. For example, if the programmer tries to access the element at index n in an array of size n-1, they will get an error.
5. **Logic errors.** Logic errors occur when the programmer makes a mistake in the logical flow of their program. For example, if the programmer tries to divide by zero, the program will crash.
6. **Memory errors.** Memory errors occur when the programmer allocates too much or too little memory for their program. For example, if the programmer allocates too little memory for an array, the program will crash when it tries to store too many elements in the array.
7. **Synchronization errors.** Synchronization errors occur when multiple threads try to access the same data at the same time. For example, if two threads are trying to update the same variable at the same time, the program's output may be incorrect.
8. **Race conditions.** Race conditions occur when the outcome of a program depends on the order in which two or more threads execute. For example, if two threads are trying to read the same variable, the value of the variable may be different depending on the order in which the threads execute.
9. **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, and no thread can proceed. For example, if two threads are both trying to acquire a lock on the same resource, the threads will deadlock and neither thread will be able to proceed.
10. **Livelocks.** Livelocks occur when two or more threads are constantly looping, waiting for each other to do something. For example, if two threads are both trying to increment a shared variable, the threads will continuously increment and decrement the variable, and neither thread will ever make any progress.

CODEFORCES 729_F. Financiers Game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specified in the problem statement is `n a1, a2, ..., an`. However, some solutions may expect the input format to be `n, a1, a2, ..., an`. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the difference between the sums of incomes**. The difference between the sums of incomes is calculated as `sum_i(a_i) - sum_j(b_j)`, where `a_i` is the income on the `i`th paper from the left and `b_j` is the income on the `j`th paper from the right. However, some solutions may incorrectly calculate the difference as `sum_i(a_i) - sum_j(b_j)`, where `a_i` is the income on the `i`th paper from the right and `b_j` is the income on the `j`th paper from the left. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. The problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ n ≤ 4000`. However, some solutions may not handle this constraint correctly. This can lead to incorrect results or runtime errors.
4. **Incorrect memory management**. The problem statement specifies that the memory limit is `256 MB`. However, some solutions may exceed this limit. This can lead to runtime errors or incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect use of data structures**. The problem statement does not specify any specific data structures that must be used. However, some solutions may use data structures that are inefficient or that do not work correctly. This can lead to incorrect results or runtime errors.
6. **Incorrect algorithm**. The problem statement does not specify any specific algorithm that must be used. However, some solutions may use algorithms that are inefficient or that do not work correctly. This can lead to incorrect results or runtime errors.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement, and to use a correct and efficient algorithm. It is also important to test your solution thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly for all possible inputs.
Test inputs:
**1. Incorrect input format**

```
1

This input is incorrect because it does not follow the specified input format. The correct input format is `n a1, a2, ..., an`.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the difference between the sums of incomes**

```
3
1 3 1
```

This input is incorrect because the difference between the sums of incomes is calculated as `sum_i(a_i) - sum_j(b_j)`, where `a_i` is the income on the `i`th paper from the left and `b_j` is the income on the `j`th paper from the right. However, this solution incorrectly calculates the difference as `sum_i(a_i) - sum_j(b_j)`, where `a_i` is the income on the `i`th paper from the right and `b_j` is the income on the `j`th paper from the left. This results in an incorrect answer of `-1`.

**3. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

```
0
```

This input is incorrect because the problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ n ≤ 4000`. However, this input has a value of `0`. This results in a runtime error.

**4. Incorrect memory management**

```
1000000
```

This input is incorrect because the problem statement specifies that the memory limit is `256 MB`. However, this input has a value of `1000000`, which exceeds the memory limit. This results in a runtime error.

**5. Incorrect use of data structures**

```
1000000
```

This input is incorrect because the problem statement does not specify any specific data structures that must be used. However, this solution uses a data structure that is inefficient and does not work correctly. This results in a runtime error.

**6. Incorrect algorithm**

```

This input is incorrect because the problem statement does not specify any specific algorithm that must be used. However, this solution uses an algorithm that is inefficient and does not work correctly. This results in a runtime error.
Title:
CODEFORCES 74_B. Train

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The input contains three integers, but the code defines `n, m, k` as strings. This will cause a `TypeError`.
2. **Incorrect index.** The code uses `i - 1` to index the list of train states, but this will cause an `IndexError` if `i == 0`.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The code checks if the stowaway and controller are in the same wagon, but it does not check if the train is moving. This could lead to the stowaway being caught even if the train is idle.
4. **Incorrect output.** The code prints the number of the minute at which the stowaway will be caught, but this will be incorrect if the train is idle.
5. **Incorrect indentation.** The code is not properly indented, which makes it difficult to read and understand.

To avoid these problems, be sure to:

1. Use the correct variable types for the input data.
2. Check the index of the list of train states before accessing it.
3. Check if the train is moving before checking if the stowaway and controller are in the same wagon.
4. Print the correct output, taking into account whether the train is moving or idle.
5. Correctly indent the code to make it easier to read and understand.

Title:
CODEFORCES 773_A. Success Rate

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain a non-integer number, or a number that is too large. The developer should check the input format and raise an error if it is incorrect.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the success rate**

The success rate is calculated as the number of successful submissions divided by the total number of submissions. The developer should make sure that this calculation is done correctly.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the number of submissions to make**

The number of submissions to make is calculated as the difference between the desired success rate and the current success rate, multiplied by the total number of submissions. The developer should make sure that this calculation is done correctly.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output should be a single integer, which is the number of submissions to make. The developer should make sure that the output is formatted correctly.

**5. Overflow**

The calculations involved in this problem can sometimes lead to overflow errors. The developer should be aware of this possibility and take steps to avoid it.

**6. Floating-point errors**

The calculations involved in this problem can sometimes lead to floating-point errors. The developer should be aware of this possibility and take steps to avoid it.

**7. Bugs in the algorithm**

The developer should carefully test the algorithm to make sure that it works correctly.

**8. Incorrect assumptions**

The developer should make sure that the assumptions made in the problem statement are correct. For example, the problem statement assumes that the input is correctly formatted and that the success rate is in the range [0, 1].

Title:
CODEFORCES 843_C. Upgrading Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the number of vertices is not a positive integer, the program may not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect edge representation.** The edges are represented as pairs of integers, but the program may not be able to correctly parse the input if the integers are not separated by a space. For example, if the input is `12345`, the program may not be able to correctly parse the input as a pair of integers.
3. **Incorrect number of edges.** The number of edges in the input must be equal to the number of vertices minus 1. If the number of edges is not correct, the program may not be able to correctly construct the tree.
4. **Incorrect tree structure.** The input edges must form a tree. If the edges do not form a tree, the program may not be able to correctly find the minimum number of transformations.
5. **Incorrect transformations.** The transformations must satisfy the following conditions:
    * There must be an edge between vertices x and y in the current tree.
    * After the transformation, the graph must remain a tree.
    * After the deletion of edge (x, y), the tree must consist of two connected components.
    * The size of the component with vertex x must be strictly larger than the size of the component with vertex y.

If any of these conditions are not satisfied, the program may not be able to correctly find the minimum number of transformations.

6. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the number of transformations is not a positive integer, the program may not be able to parse the output correctly.
7. **Incorrect transformation representation.** The transformations are represented as triples of integers, but the program may not be able to correctly parse the output if the integers are not separated by a space. For example, if the output is `12345`, the program may not be able to correctly parse the output as a triple of integers.
8. **Incorrect number of transformations.** The number of transformations in the output must be equal to the number of transformations specified in the input. If the number of transformations is not correct, the program may not be able to correctly minimize the sum of squared distances between all pairs of vertices.
9. **Incorrect sum of squared distances.** The sum of squared distances between all pairs of vertices in the output tree must be minimized. If the sum of squared distances is not minimized, the program may not be able to find the optimal solution.

These are just some of the most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. By carefully following the input and output format, and by correctly checking the validity of the input and output, you can avoid these problems and bugs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 960_E. Alternating Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the DFS traversal.** The DFS traversal should visit all the nodes in the tree, and the order of the nodes visited should not matter. For example, in the following code, the DFS traversal will visit the nodes in the order of 1, 2, 3, 4, but the correct order should be 1, 3, 2, 4.

```
def dfs(node):
  visited.add(node)
  for neighbor in graph[node]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
      dfs(neighbor)
```

2. **Incorrect calculation of the alternating function.** The alternating function for a path is defined as the sum of the values of the nodes in the path, multiplied by (-1)^(number of edges in the path). For example, the alternating function for the path 1 -> 2 -> 3 is (-4) + 1 + 5 = 2.

```
def alternating_function(path):
  result = 0
  for node in path:
    result += values[node] * (-1) ** (len(path) - 1)
  return result
```

3. **Incorrect handling of cycles in the tree.** A cycle in a tree is a path that starts and ends at the same node. When calculating the alternating function for a path that contains a cycle, the value of the node at the start of the cycle should be multiplied by (-1)^(number of edges in the cycle). For example, the alternating function for the path 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 is (-4) + 1 + 5 + (-4) = 5.

```
def alternating_function(path):
  result = 0
  for node in path:
    result += values[node] * (-1) ** (len(path) - 1)
  if path[0] in path[1:]:
    result *= (-1) ** len(path[1:])
  return result
```

4. **Incorrect calculation of the final answer.** The final answer is the sum of the alternating functions of all the unique simple paths in the tree. To calculate this sum, you can use a hash table to store the alternating functions of all the paths that you have already seen. This will prevent you from calculating the same path multiple times.

Title:
CODEFORCES 988_B. Substrings Sort

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain an integer n, followed by n lines of strings. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to process the input correctly and will likely produce an incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect string comparison**. The program must compare strings lexicographically, which means that the strings should be compared character by character, starting from the first character. If the strings are not compared correctly, the program may produce an incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect substring search**. The program must be able to find all substrings of a given string. If the substring search is not implemented correctly, the program may produce an incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the program should print "YES" if the strings can be reordered in the required order, followed by the reordered strings. If the output format is not correct, the program will not produce the correct output.
5. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other possible bugs that could occur when solving this problem, such as incorrect memory management, incorrect data structures, and incorrect algorithm design. It is important to carefully check the code for all possible errors before submitting it for grading.

HACKEREARTH call-list-4

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly checking if a number is a prefix of another.** One common mistake is to check if a number is a prefix of another by simply comparing the first few digits. This is not always correct, because two numbers may have the same prefix but different lengths. For example, the numbers 12345 and 123456 are both prefixes of the number 123456789.
2. **Not handling numbers with leading zeros correctly.** Some phone numbers may have leading zeros, which must be considered when checking if a number is a prefix of another. For example, the number 012345 is a prefix of the number 12345.
3. **Not handling invalid phone numbers correctly.** Some phone numbers may be invalid, such as numbers that are too short or too long. These numbers should be ignored when checking if the list of phone numbers is consistent.
4. **Not handling duplicate phone numbers correctly.** The input may contain duplicate phone numbers. These numbers should be ignored when checking if the list of phone numbers is consistent.
5. **Not handling the case where the list of phone numbers is empty.** The input may contain an empty list of phone numbers. In this case, the output should be "YES".

HACKEREARTH dee-dees-shopping-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly using the modulo operator**. The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. For example, 10 % 3 = 1, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1. In the problem statement, we are told that Dee Dee wants to buy exactly N eggs. If N is not divisible by 6 or 8, then the modulo operator will return a non-zero value. This means that the number of eggs that Dee Dee can buy will not be an integer. For example, if N = 11, then Dee Dee can buy 11 / 6 = 1 cartons of 6 eggs and 11 % 6 = 5 eggs. This means that Dee Dee can buy a total of 1 + 1 = 2 cartons of eggs. However, the problem statement asks us to print the **minimal** number of egg cartons that Dee Dee must buy. In this case, the minimal number of egg cartons is 1.
2. **Not considering all possible cases**. The problem statement states that there are two types of egg cartons available in the shop. One type contains 6 eggs and the other type contains 8 eggs. However, the problem statement does not specify which type of egg carton Dee Dee should buy. This means that we need to consider all possible cases. For example, if N = 11, then Dee Dee can buy 1 cartons of 6 eggs and 5 eggs. This means that Dee Dee can buy a total of 1 + 1 = 2 cartons of eggs. However, if Dee Dee buys 1 cartons of 8 eggs and 3 eggs, then she can buy a total of 1 + 3 = 4 cartons of eggs. In this case, the minimal number of egg cartons is 4.
3. **Using incorrect data types**. The problem statement states that N is an integer. This means that we need to use an integer data type to store the value of N. If we use a floating-point data type, then the value of N may be rounded to the nearest decimal place. This could lead to incorrect results. For example, if N = 11.5, then the value of N would be rounded to 12. This means that Dee Dee would buy 1 cartons of 6 eggs and 6 eggs. This means that Dee Dee would buy a total of 1 + 1 = 2 cartons of eggs. However, the minimal number of egg cartons is 1.
4. **Not handling errors correctly**. The problem statement does not specify what to do if N is less than 1 or greater than 100. This means that we need to handle these errors correctly. For example, if N = 0, then we should print -1. This is because it is impossible to buy 0 eggs.
5. **Not using efficient algorithms**. The problem statement asks us to print the minimal number of egg cartons that Dee Dee must buy. This means that we need to find the smallest possible value of M such that N = 6 * M or N = 8 * M. We can do this by using a binary search algorithm. A binary search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half until the desired value is found. This algorithm is very efficient and can find the smallest possible value of M in a small number of steps.

1. **Incorrect implementation of the factorial function.** The factorial function is a common mathematical function that computes the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given integer. It is often used in problems involving permutations and combinations. However, it is important to implement the factorial function correctly, as a small mistake can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic.** Modulo arithmetic is a mathematical operation that returns the remainder of a division operation. It is often used to handle overflow errors when working with large numbers. However, it is important to use modulo arithmetic correctly, as a small mistake can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect handling of boundary conditions.** Boundary conditions are special cases that occur when a function is evaluated at a specific value. It is important to handle boundary conditions correctly, as a small mistake can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect use of floating-point arithmetic.** Floating-point arithmetic is a type of arithmetic that uses approximate representations of real numbers. It is often used in computer programs because it is faster than integer arithmetic. However, it is important to use floating-point arithmetic correctly, as a small mistake can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect use of recursion.** Recursion is a programming technique that allows a function to call itself. It is often used to solve problems that involve a repeating pattern. However, it is important to use recursion correctly, as a small mistake can lead to infinite recursion or incorrect results.
6. **Incorrect use of dynamic programming.** Dynamic programming is a programming technique that allows a function to reuse previously computed results. It is often used to solve problems that involve overlapping subproblems. However, it is important to use dynamic programming correctly, as a small mistake can lead to incorrect results.
7. **Incorrect use of memoization.** Memoization is a programming technique that stores the results of previously computed functions. It is often used to speed up programs that involve repeated function calls. However, it is important to use memoization correctly, as a small mistake can lead to incorrect results.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input may contain strings that are not of the correct data type. For example, a string that contains numbers or special characters. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect format**. The input may not be in the correct format. For example, the strings may not be separated by spaces, or the queries may not be in the correct order. This can also cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. The program may incorrectly count the number of times a string appears in the range. For example, it may count the string at the beginning of the range twice, or it may not count the string at the end of the range. This can also cause the program to produce incorrect results.
4. **Memory errors**. The program may use too much memory, which can slow down the execution or even cause the program to crash. This can happen if the program does not properly manage its memory.
5. **Algorithmic errors**. The program may use an inefficient algorithm to solve the problem. This can cause the program to run slowly or even produce incorrect results.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input data and to make sure that the program is correctly implemented. It is also important to use efficient algorithms and to manage memory carefully.

Title:
HACKEREARTH monk-and-his-friend

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly comparing the bits of two numbers.** The developer may incorrectly compare the bits of two numbers, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the developer may compare the bits of `1` and `4` as follows:

```
1: 0001
4: 0100

1 and 4 differ in 2 bits.
```

However, this is incorrect. The correct way to compare the bits of two numbers is to use the bitwise XOR operator (`^`). For example, the bits of `1` and `4` can be compared as follows:

```
1 ^ 4 = 0101
```

This shows that `1` and `4` differ in only one bit.

2. **Using incorrect data types.** The developer may use incorrect data types to store the numbers, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the developer may store the numbers as `int`s, which can only store numbers up to 2^31-1. This means that if the numbers are larger than 2^31-1, the developer will get an incorrect answer.

3. **Using incorrect algorithms.** The developer may use incorrect algorithms to solve the problem, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the developer may use a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem, which will be very slow for large numbers.

4. **Not handling special cases correctly.** The developer may not handle special cases correctly, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the developer may not handle the case where one of the numbers is zero.

5. **Not testing the code correctly.** The developer may not test the code correctly, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the developer may only test the code on a few small cases, which may not be representative of all possible cases.

6. **Not using the right tools.** The developer may not use the right tools to solve the problem, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the developer may use a text editor to write the code, which may not be the best tool for the job.

7. **Not debugging the code correctly.** The developer may not debug the code correctly, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the developer may not use the right tools to debug the code, or the developer may not know how to debug the code.

HACKEREARTH parenthesis-sequence

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem states that the input string will only contain characters '(' and ')'. However, the solution code uses a list to store the characters in the string. This can lead to errors if the input string contains other characters.
2. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** The solution code uses a brute-force algorithm to find the minimum number of parentheses needed to close the string. This algorithm is inefficient and can lead to long running times for large input strings.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The solution code does not handle the edge case where the input string is empty. This can lead to errors if the input string is empty.
4. **Incorrect error handling.** The solution code does not handle errors that may occur during execution. This can lead to unexpected behavior if an error occurs.
5. **Inefficient code.** The solution code can be improved by using more efficient algorithms and data structures. This can lead to shorter running times for large input strings.
6. **Unclear code.** The solution code is not well-commented and is difficult to understand. This can make it difficult for other developers to understand and maintain the code.

To avoid these problems, the developer should:

1. Use the correct data structures for the problem. In this case, a string would be a more appropriate data structure than a list.
2. Use a more efficient algorithm to find the minimum number of parentheses needed to close the string. A greedy algorithm or dynamic programming algorithm would be more efficient than a brute-force algorithm.
3. Handle edge cases correctly. The solution code should handle the edge case where the input string is empty.
4. Handle errors correctly. The solution code should handle errors that may occur during execution.
5. Improve the efficiency of the code. The solution code can be improved by using more efficient algorithms and data structures.
6. Make the code more clear and concise. The solution code should be well-commented and easy to understand.

HACKEREARTH string-permutations-1

Pain points:
1. **Using an incorrect data type.** The input data is a list of strings, so the developer should use a list to store the names. Using an incorrect data type, such as a set, could lead to incorrect results.
2. **Not using a dictionary to store the frequency counts.** A dictionary is a data structure that is ideal for storing key-value pairs. In this problem, the keys would be the names and the values would be the frequency counts. Using a dictionary would allow the developer to quickly and easily find the maximum frequency.
3. **Not using a loop to iterate over the list of names.** A loop is a programming construct that allows the developer to repeat a block of code a specified number of times. In this problem, the developer would need to use a loop to iterate over the list of names and count the number of times each name appears.
4. **Not using the max() function to find the maximum frequency.** The max() function takes a list of values as input and returns the largest value in the list. In this problem, the developer would need to use the max() function to find the maximum frequency.
5. **Not handling the case where multiple names have the same maximum frequency.** In this problem, it is possible that multiple names have the same maximum frequency. In this case, the developer would need to output the sum of all the maximum frequencies.

Title:
HACKEREARTH utkarsh-and-faulty-rain-gauge-february-easy-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.** When working with floating-point numbers, it is important to be aware of the limitations of the data type. For example, the number `0.1` cannot be exactly represented as a floating-point number in binary, so it will be rounded to the nearest representable value. This can lead to errors in calculations if you are not careful.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over a collection of elements, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one or more elements. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect use of pointers.** Pointers can be a powerful tool, but they can also be a source of errors. It is important to make sure that you are using pointers correctly and that you are not dereferencing a NULL pointer.
4. **Memory leaks.** When you allocate memory, it is important to free it when you are finished with it. If you do not free the memory, it will eventually lead to a memory leak. Memory leaks can slow down your program and can even cause it to crash.
5. **Race conditions.** A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even a crash. It is important to use synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions.
6. **Deadlocks.** A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can prevent any of the threads from making progress and can eventually cause the program to crash. It is important to avoid deadlocks by using appropriate locking mechanisms.
7. **Unhandled exceptions.** When an exception occurs, it is important to handle it appropriately. If you do not handle an exception, it will be passed to the next higher level in the call stack. This can eventually lead to the program crashing.
8. **Security vulnerabilities.** It is important to write secure code. This means that you should protect your code from attackers who are trying to exploit vulnerabilities. There are a number of things you can do to improve the security of your code, such as using secure coding practices and implementing security measures.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect comparison operator**. The problem states that the air conditioner will be turned on if the temperature is 30 degrees Celsius or above. However, a developer may incorrectly compare the temperature to 30 degrees Celsius and return the wrong answer. For example, if the temperature is 29 degrees Celsius, the developer may incorrectly return `Yes`.
2. **Incorrect type casting**. The problem states that the temperature is an integer. However, a developer may incorrectly cast the temperature to a float and return the wrong answer. For example, if the temperature is 30.0 degrees Celsius, the developer may incorrectly return `Yes`.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The problem states that the air conditioner will be turned on if, and only if, the temperature is 30 degrees Celsius or above. However, a developer may incorrectly return `Yes` if the temperature is less than 30 degrees Celsius. For example, if the temperature is 29 degrees Celsius, the developer may incorrectly return `Yes`.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The problem states that the output should be `Yes` if the air conditioner will be turned on, and `No` otherwise. However, a developer may incorrectly output the wrong answer. For example, if the air conditioner will be turned on, the developer may incorrectly output `No`.

Title:
ATCODER p02725 AtCoder Beginner Contest 160 - Traveling Salesman around Lake

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input specifies that `K` and `N` are integers, but a developer may accidentally use a floating-point type. This could lead to incorrect results, as floating-point numbers are not always precise.

**2. Not handling the case where `N` is 1**

The problem states that `N` must be at least 2, but a developer may accidentally forget to check this. If `N` is 1, the solution is trivial: the distance traveled is simply `A_1`.

**3. Not handling the case where `A_1` is 0**

The problem states that `A_1` must be strictly greater than 0, but a developer may accidentally forget to check this. If `A_1` is 0, the solution is also trivial: the distance traveled is simply `K`.

**4. Not handling the case where `A_N` is equal to `K`**

The problem states that `A_N` must be strictly less than `K`, but a developer may accidentally forget to check this. If `A_N` is equal to `K`, the solution is also trivial: the distance traveled is simply `K`.

**5. Not handling the case where two or more of the `A_i` values are equal**

The problem does not specify what to do in the case where two or more of the `A_i` values are equal. A developer may accidentally assume that the solution is always the same, regardless of the values of the `A_i` values. However, this is not always the case. For example, if `A_1` and `A_2` are equal, the solution is `A_1 + A_3`.

**6. Not handling the case where the houses are arranged in a circle**

The problem states that the houses are arranged around a circular pond. A developer may accidentally assume that the houses are arranged in a straight line. However, this is not always the case. If the houses are arranged in a circle, the solution is different.

ATCODER p02992 AtCoder Beginner Contest 132 - Small Products

Pain points:
**1. The input format is incorrect**

The input format for this problem is `N K`, where `N` and `K` are integers. However, the example input `3 2` is missing a space between `3` and `2`. This will cause the program to crash when it tries to parse the input.

**2. The output format is incorrect**

The output for this problem should be a single integer, modulo 10^9+7. However, the example output `5` is not modulo 10^9+7. This will cause the program to output an incorrect answer.

**3. The program does not account for all possible cases**

The program only considers sequences of length `K` where the product of any two adjacent elements is at most `N`. However, it is possible to have a sequence of length `K` where the product of two adjacent elements is greater than `N`. This will cause the program to output an incorrect answer.

**4. The program is inefficient**

The program uses a brute-force approach to solve the problem. This means that it checks every possible sequence of length `K` to see if it satisfies the given constraints. This can be very inefficient, especially for large values of `N` and `K`.

**5. The program has a bug**

The program has a bug where it incorrectly calculates the number of sequences of length `K` that satisfy the given constraints. This is because it does not account for the fact that some sequences may have duplicate elements.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input format, output format, and all possible cases. They should also use an efficient algorithm to solve the problem and carefully test the program for bugs.

Title:
ATCODER p03133 Yahoo Programming Contest 2019 - Odd Subrectangles

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect calculation of the number of subrectangles**

The most common mistake is to incorrectly calculate the number of subrectangles. For example, in the following code, the number of subrectangles is calculated as `2 ** (n + m)`, which is incorrect.

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
a = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

count = 2 ** (n + m)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if a[i][j] == 1:
            count -= 1

print(count % 998244353)
```

The correct way to calculate the number of subrectangles is to use the following formula:

```
count = (2 ** n) * (2 ** m) - 2 * sum(sum(a[i]) for i in range(n))
```

**2. Incorrect use of modulo operator**

Another common mistake is to incorrectly use the modulo operator. For example, in the following code, the modulo operator is used to calculate the remainder of `count / 998244353`, which is incorrect.

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
a = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

count = 2 ** (n + m)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if a[i][j] == 1:
            count -= 1

print(count // 998244353)
```

The correct way to use the modulo operator is to calculate the remainder of `count % 998244353`, which is the following code:

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
a = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

count = 2 ** (n + m)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if a[i][j] == 1:
            count -= 1

print(count % 998244353)
```

**3. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

Another common mistake is to incorrectly handle edge cases. For example, in the following code, the edge case where `n == 0` or `m == 0` is not handled correctly.

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
a = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

count = 2 ** (n + m)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if a[i][j] == 1:
            count -= 1

print(count % 998244353)
```

The correct way to handle this edge case is to check if `n == 0` or `m == 0`, and if so, print `0`.

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
a = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

count = 2 ** (n + m)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if a[i][j] == 1:
            count -= 1

if n == 0 or m == 0:
    print(0)
else:
    print(count % 998244353)
```

**4. Incorrect use of data structures**

Another common mistake is to incorrectly use data structures. For example, in the following code, the list `a` is used to store the values of the grid, but it is not initialized correctly.

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
a = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

count = 2 ** (n + m)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if a[i][j] == 1:
            count -= 1

print(count %

Title:
ATCODER p03278 AtCoder Regular Contest 101 - Ribbons on Tree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not correctly followed. For example, if the number of vertices is not even, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The data type of the input values is not correctly specified. For example, if the number of vertices is a string, the program will crash.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve the problem is incorrect. For example, if the algorithm does not take into account the fact that the graph is a tree, the program will give incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect implementation**

The program is not correctly implemented. For example, if there are errors in the code, the program will crash.

**5. Incorrect test cases**

The test cases used to verify the correctness of the program are not correct. For example, if the test cases do not cover all possible cases, the program may not be correct.

Title:
ATCODER p03433 AtCoder Beginner Contest 088 - Infinite Coins

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect input handling

The input format is not very strict, so it is possible for a developer to accidentally mistype the input and get incorrect results. For example, if the developer accidentally inputs `N = 10001` instead of `N = 10000`, the program will output `Yes` even though the correct answer is `No`.

### 2. Incorrect calculation of the number of 1-yen coins needed

The number of 1-yen coins needed to pay for N yen is `N % 500`. However, if the developer accidentally calculates the number of 1-yen coins as `N / 500`, the program will output the wrong answer.

### 3. Incorrect comparison of the number of 1-yen coins and A

The program must compare the number of 1-yen coins needed to pay for N yen with A. If the number of 1-yen coins is less than A, the program must output `No`. However, if the developer accidentally compares the number of 1-yen coins with N, the program will output the wrong answer.

### 4. Incorrect output

The program must output `Yes` if the number of 1-yen coins is less than A or `No` if the number of 1-yen coins is greater than or equal to A. However, if the developer accidentally outputs the wrong answer, the program will not produce the correct output.

Title:
ATCODER p03592 CODE FESTIVAL 2017 qual A - fLIP

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The variable `K` should be an integer, but the user may accidentally type it as a string. This would cause the program to crash.
2. **Off-by-one error:** The user may accidentally calculate the number of black squares incorrectly. For example, they may count the squares in the first row twice. This would cause the program to give the wrong answer.
3. **Incorrect logic:** The user may incorrectly implement the algorithm for finding the number of black squares. For example, they may not account for the fact that pressing a button can change the color of multiple squares. This would cause the program to give the wrong answer.
4. **Runtime error:** The user may implement the algorithm in a way that takes too long to run. For example, they may use a recursive function that calls itself too many times. This would cause the program to run out of time and give a timeout error.
5. **Memory error:** The user may implement the algorithm in a way that uses too much memory. For example, they may create a large array to store the colors of the squares. This would cause the program to run out of memory and crash.

Title:
ATCODER p03749 AtCoder Grand Contest 013 - Placing Squares

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one errors.** When computing the indices of the marks, it is easy to make a mistake and add 1 or subtract 1 too many times. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect modulo arithmetic.** When computing the beauty of an arrangement of squares, it is important to remember to perform the modulo operation after each multiplication. Otherwise, the results can overflow and become incorrect.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement specifies that the bar has length N and that there are M marks on it. It is important to check for these conditions before computing the beauty of an arrangement of squares. Otherwise, the results can be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem statement specifies that the marks are given in sorted order. It is important to use a data structure that can efficiently store and access the marks in sorted order. Otherwise, the algorithm can be inefficient.
5. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** The problem statement asks for the sum of the beauty over all possible arrangements of squares. There are many different ways to compute this sum. It is important to choose an algorithm that is both efficient and correct.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use a test suite to thoroughly test your code. This will help you catch off-by-one errors and other bugs.
* Make sure to understand the modulo operation before using it. This will help you avoid incorrect modulo arithmetic.
* Carefully check for edge cases. This will help you avoid incorrect results.
* Use the correct data structures for the problem. This will help you improve the efficiency of your algorithm.
* Choose the right algorithm for the problem. This will help you achieve the best possible performance.

Title:
AIZU p00934 L Jumps

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. The developer should check the input format and handle incorrect input gracefully.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. When calculating the distance between two points, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, the distance between (0, 0) and (1, 1) is 2, not 3. The developer should be careful to avoid off-by-one errors.
3. **Arithmetic overflow**. When calculating the total distance, it is possible to overflow the integer data type. The developer should use a larger data type, such as long, to avoid arithmetic overflow.
4. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm for solving the problem. For example, the developer may try to solve the problem by brute force, which will take a long time. The developer should use a more efficient algorithm, such as dynamic programming.
5. **Incorrect implementation**. The developer may make a mistake when implementing the algorithm. For example, the developer may use the wrong data structure, or the developer may make a mistake in the logic of the algorithm. The developer should carefully review the implementation to ensure that it is correct.

**2. Not handling the case where two circles intersect**

The problem states that the circles do not intersect. However, it is possible for two circles to be tangent to each other. If you do not handle this case correctly, your program may produce incorrect results.

**3. Not handling the case where a circle is contained in another circle**

The problem states that the circles do not intersect. However, it is possible for one circle to be completely contained in another circle. If you do not handle this case correctly, your program may produce incorrect results.

**4. Not handling the case where a circle is on the boundary of another circle**

The problem states that the circles do not intersect. However, it is possible for a circle to be on the boundary of another circle. If you do not handle this case correctly, your program may produce incorrect results.

**5. Not handling the case where there are no circles**

The problem states that there are at least two circles. However, it is possible that there are no circles at all. If you do not handle this case correctly, your program may produce incorrect results.

**6. Not handling the case where the first circle has a radius of 0**

The problem states that the first circle has a radius of at least 1. However, it is possible that the first circle has a radius of 0. If you do not handle this case correctly, your program may produce incorrect results.

Title:
AIZU p01200 Resource

Pain points:
```
Possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format of the problem is not very clear. It is possible that the developer may misinterpret the input format and make mistakes.
* **Incorrect calculation of the exclusive resource zone (ERZ):** The ERZ of each island is defined as a sea area within an agreed distance d from the boundary of the island. It is possible that the developer may make mistakes when calculating the ERZ.
* **Incorrect calculation of the amount of resource available in each region:** The amount of resource available in a (partial) area of a region is given by <the amount per unit area> × <the area size>. It is possible that the developer may make mistakes when calculating the amount of resource available in each region.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format of the problem is not very clear. It is possible that the developer may misinterpret the output format and make mistakes.

Here are some tips to avoid these problems and bugs:

* **Be careful when reading the input format:** Make sure that you understand the input format correctly. If you are not sure, ask a friend or colleague to help you.
* **Double-check your calculations:** When calculating the ERZ and the amount of resource available in each region, make sure that you double-check your calculations. It is easy to make mistakes, so it is important to be careful.
* **Test your code:** Once you have written your code, test it with some sample inputs and outputs. This will help you to identify any errors in your code.
* **Ask for help:** If you are still having trouble, don't be afraid to ask for help. There are many resources available online, such as forums and online tutorials.

Title:
AIZU p01337 The Number of the Real Roots of a Cubic Equation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect sign of discriminant.** The discriminant of a cubic equation is $b^2-4ac$. If the discriminant is negative, the equation has no real roots. However, some developers may incorrectly check for a positive discriminant.
2. **Incorrect calculation of roots.** The roots of a cubic equation can be found using the following formula:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$

Some developers may incorrectly calculate the roots, leading to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect handling of degenerate cases.** A cubic equation can have one, two, or three real roots. Some developers may not handle degenerate cases correctly, leading to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The output for the number of positive and negative real roots should be separated by a space. Some developers may incorrectly output the results in the wrong format.

By following these tips, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving the problem of finding the number of real roots of a cubic equation.

Title:
AIZU p01504 AYBABTU

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input may contain incorrect data types, such as strings instead of integers. The developer should check the data type of each input and convert it to the correct type if necessary.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer may accidentally miss or add one element when iterating over a list or array. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may make a mistake in the logic of their algorithm. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer may accidentally create objects that are never deleted, which can lead to a memory leak. This can eventually cause the program to crash.
5. **Race conditions**. The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data, which can lead to race conditions. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or even crash.
6. **Deadlocks**. The developer may create a situation where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, which can lead to a deadlock. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer may accidentally introduce a security vulnerability in their code. This can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system.
8. **Unintended consequences**. The developer may not fully understand the consequences of their actions, which can lead to unintended consequences. This can include anything from minor annoyances to major disasters.

Title:
AIZU p01675 The J-th Number

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of merge sort**

Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts an array by splitting it in half recursively until each subarray contains a single element. The two sorted subarrays are then merged back together into a single sorted array. One common mistake that developers make when implementing merge sort is to incorrectly merge the two subarrays. This can result in the array being out of order.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to make sure that the two subarrays are sorted before they are merged. This can be done by using a sorting algorithm such as quicksort or insertion sort.

**2. Using an incorrect data structure**

Another common mistake that developers make when solving this problem is to use an incorrect data structure. For example, if the input array is very large, it may be more efficient to use a linked list instead of an array. This is because linked lists do not require as much memory as arrays, and they can be more easily modified.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm that is used to solve this problem is also important. There are many different sorting algorithms available, and each one has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, quicksort is a very efficient sorting algorithm, but it is not stable. This means that it does not preserve the original order of equal elements in the array.

When choosing an algorithm to solve this problem, it is important to consider the size of the input array and the importance of preserving the original order of equal elements.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

Another common mistake that developers make when solving this problem is not handling edge cases. For example, what happens if the input array is empty? Or what happens if the input array contains only one element? It is important to make sure that your code handles all of these edge cases correctly.

**5. Not testing your code**

Finally, it is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it. This will help you to identify any bugs or errors in your code. You can test your code by using a variety of different input arrays. You can also test your code by using a debugger to step through your code and watch how it works.

Title:
AIZU p01819 Where is the Boundary

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly specified. For example, the input could be "2 1 WE" or "2 1 WE\n" or "2 1 WE\r\n". The developer should make sure to handle all possible input formats correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not strictly specified. For example, the output could be "1 2" or "1,2" or "(1,2)". The developer should make sure to output the correct format.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer may accidentally miscalculate the indices of the cells in the grid. This could lead to incorrect results.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer may accidentally create objects that are never deleted. This could lead to a memory leak.
5. **Race conditions**. The developer may accidentally access shared data from multiple threads at the same time. This could lead to incorrect results or even a deadlock.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer may accidentally expose sensitive data to an attacker. This could allow the attacker to steal data or take control of the system.
7. **Other bugs**. There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. The developer should be aware of these potential bugs and take steps to avoid them.

### Possible Problems and Bugs ###

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of points is not specified correctly, the program may crash.
* **Incorrect calculation of distances:** The distance between two points is calculated incorrectly, which may lead to the program incorrectly identifying whether all the points can be placed in the laboratory. For example, if the distance between two points is calculated as the Euclidean distance instead of the Manhattan distance, the program may incorrectly identify that the points can be placed in the laboratory.
* **Incorrect rotation of points:** The points are rotated incorrectly, which may lead to the program incorrectly identifying whether all the points can be placed in the laboratory. For example, if the points are rotated by an incorrect angle, the program may incorrectly identify that the points can be placed in the laboratory.
* **Incorrect translation of points:** The points are translated incorrectly, which may lead to the program incorrectly identifying whether all the points can be placed in the laboratory. For example, if the points are translated by an incorrect amount, the program may incorrectly identify that the points can be placed in the laboratory.
* **Incorrect check for whether all the points can be placed in the laboratory:** The program incorrectly checks whether all the points can be placed in the laboratory, which may lead to an incorrect answer. For example, the program may incorrectly identify that all the points can be placed in the laboratory when they cannot.

### How to Avoid These Problems and Bugs ###

To avoid these problems and bugs, it is important to carefully follow the input format and to correctly calculate the distances between points. It is also important to correctly rotate and translate the points and to correctly check whether all the points can be placed in the laboratory.

Here are some specific tips for avoiding these problems and bugs:

* Make sure to read the problem carefully and understand the input format.
* Use a programming language that you are familiar with and that has good support for mathematical operations.
* Write unit tests to verify that your program is correctly calculating the distances between points and rotating and translating the points.
* Write a comprehensive test suite to verify that your program is correctly checking whether all the points can be placed in the laboratory.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid the most common problems and bugs that developers encounter when solving this problem.

Title:
AIZU p02239 Breadth First Search

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect graph representation**. The graph is represented as an adjacency list, where each vertex is represented by a list of its adjacent vertices. However, the input format does not specify the order of the adjacent vertices. This can lead to incorrect results if the order of the adjacent vertices is not the same as the order in which they are processed.
2. **Incorrect use of BFS**. BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that starts at a given vertex and visits all of its adjacent vertices before moving on to the next vertex. However, the input format does not specify the starting vertex. This can lead to incorrect results if the starting vertex is not the same as the vertex that is being processed.
3. **Incorrect handling of negative edge weights**. The input format does not specify whether the edge weights are positive or negative. This can lead to incorrect results if the edge weights are negative.
4. **Incorrect handling of self-loops**. The input format does not specify whether the graph contains self-loops. This can lead to incorrect results if the graph contains self-loops.
5. **Incorrect handling of disconnected graphs**. The input format does not specify whether the graph is connected. This can lead to incorrect results if the graph is disconnected.
