CODECHEF atom

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The variable `N` should be of type `int`, but it is of type `str`. This will cause a `TypeError`.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator:** The comparison operator `>` should be used instead of `>=`. This will cause a `ValueError`.
3. **Incorrect indentation:** The code is not properly indented, which can make it difficult to read and understand.
4. **Missing semicolon:** The semicolon at the end of the `for` loop is missing. This will cause a `SyntaxError`.
5. **Unnecessary variable declaration:** The variable `t` is declared but never used. This is unnecessary and can lead to confusion.
6. **Incorrect variable assignment:** The variable `t` is assigned the value of `N`, but it should be assigned the value of `0`. This will cause the code to not work correctly.
7. **Off-by-one error:** The code checks if the number of atoms is less than or equal to `M`, but it should check if the number of atoms is less than `M`. This will cause the code to stop the reaction too early.

### Possible Problems

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not as expected. This can be caused by a typo in the code, or by a misunderstanding of the problem statement.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not as expected. This can be caused by a typo in the code, or by a misunderstanding of the problem statement.
* **Incorrect solution:** The solution does not produce the correct output. This can be caused by a bug in the code, or by a misunderstanding of the problem statement.
* **Time limit exceeded:** The solution runs too slowly and times out. This can be caused by a inefficient algorithm, or by a large input.
* **Memory limit exceeded:** The solution uses too much memory and runs out of memory. This can be caused by a inefficient algorithm, or by a large input.

### Possible Bugs

* **Off-by-one errors:** These are errors where the code computes the wrong answer by one. This can be caused by a typo in the code, or by a misunderstanding of the problem statement.
* **Index errors:** These are errors where the code accesses an element of an array or list out of bounds. This can be caused by a typo in the code, or by a misunderstanding of the problem statement.
* **Arithmetic errors:** These are errors where the code performs an arithmetic operation incorrectly. This can be caused by a typo in the code, or by a misunderstanding of the problem statement.
* **Logic errors:** These are errors where the code does not follow the intended logic. This can be caused by a misunderstanding of the problem statement, or by a bug in the code.

### How to Avoid These Problems

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement. It is also important to test your code thoroughly with a variety of inputs. Here are some specific tips for avoiding common problems:

* **Use the correct input format:** Make sure that your code is reading the input in the correct format. This can be checked by printing the input to the console and verifying that it is correct.
* **Use the correct output format:** Make sure that your code is printing the output in the correct format. This can be checked by printing the output to the console and verifying that it is correct.
* **Write unit tests:** Unit tests are small pieces of code that test individual parts of your solution. They can help you to identify bugs early on and prevent them from causing problems later.
* **Use a debugger:** A debugger can help you to track down bugs in your code. It can show you the values of variables at different points in the code, and it can help you to identify the line of code where the bug is occurring.
* **Ask for help:** If you are stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help. There are many online resources available, such as forums, chat rooms, and online tutorials.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1056_B. Divide Candies

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains two integers n and m. If we use the wrong data type, such as int, to store n and m, we may get a wrong answer. For example, if n = 1000000000 and m = 1, the correct answer is 1000000000, but if we use int to store n and m, the answer will be 2147483647, which is wrong.

**2. Using the wrong formula**

The formula to calculate the number of sets that can be split equally is ```(n^2 + m - 1) / m```. If we use the wrong formula, such as ```n^2 / m```, we may get a wrong answer.

**3. Not considering the edge cases**

The input may contain some edge cases, such as ```n = 1``` or ```m = 1```. If we don't consider these edge cases, we may get a wrong answer.

**4. Making a mistake in the implementation**

Even if we use the correct data type, formula, and edge cases, we may still make a mistake in the implementation. For example, we may forget to add ```1``` to the result.

**5. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code before submitting it. This will help us to catch any bugs in the code.
Test inputs:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
print((n**2 + m - 1) // m)
```

**2. Using the wrong formula**

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
print(n**2 // m)
```

**3. Not considering the edge cases**

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
if n == 1:
    print(1)
elif m == 1:
    print(n**2)
else:
    print((n**2 + m - 1) // m)
```

**4. Making a mistake in the implementation**

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
print((n**2 + m - 1) // m + 1)
```

**5. Not testing the code**

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
if n == 1:
    assert print(1) == 1
elif m == 1:
    assert print(n**2) == n**2

Title:
CODEFORCES 1078_C. Vasya and Maximum Matching

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a tree with n vertices. The number of edges in a tree is n - 1. So the input data can be very large. If we use an integer to store the number of edges, we may get an integer overflow error.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the number of ways to delete some (possibly empty) subset of edges so that the maximum matching in the resulting graph is unique. We can use the following algorithm to solve the problem:

1. Find all the maximum matchings in the tree.
2. For each maximum matching, find the number of ways to delete some edges from the matching such that the resulting graph is still a tree.
3. Add all the numbers obtained in step 2 and modulo 998244353.

The problem is that the number of maximum matchings in a tree can be very large. If we use the brute force algorithm to find all the maximum matchings, we may get a time limit exceeded error.

**3. Using the wrong modulo**

The problem asks us to output the answer modulo 998244353. If we use a wrong modulo, the answer may be incorrect.

**4. Not handling the corner cases**

The problem has some corner cases. For example, the input data may be empty. We need to handle these corner cases carefully.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1146_G. Zoning Restrictions

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct.**

The input format is `n,h,m`, where `n` is the number of spots, `h` is the maximum height, and `m` is the number of restrictions. However, the input format in the problem statement is `n h m`. This can cause the developer to misread the input format and incorrectly parse the input data.

**2. The output format is not correct.**

The output format is a single integer, which is the maximum profit possible. However, the output format in the problem statement is `14`. This can cause the developer to incorrectly print the output data.

**3. The developer may not understand the problem correctly.**

The problem is about building houses on a street with zoning restrictions. The developer may not understand the problem correctly and make incorrect assumptions about the input data or the output data.

**4. The developer may not use the correct data structures or algorithms.**

The problem requires the developer to find the maximum profit possible. This can be done using a dynamic programming approach. However, the developer may not be familiar with dynamic programming and use an incorrect algorithm.

**5. The developer may not handle the corner cases correctly.**

The problem has several corner cases, such as the case where there are no restrictions or the case where the maximum height is 0. The developer may not handle these corner cases correctly and get incorrect results.

**6. The developer may not test their code correctly.**

The developer should test their code with a variety of input data to ensure that it is correct. However, the developer may not test their code correctly and introduce bugs.

CODEFORCES 1167_G. Low Budget Inception

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a non-integer number, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The data type of the input or output may be incorrect, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a floating-point number, but the program expects an integer, the program may crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** The program may miss or add one or more elements when processing the input or output, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. For example, if the program is supposed to print the first 100 elements of a list, but it only prints the first 99 elements, the program is producing incorrect results.
4. **Arithmetic errors.** The program may produce incorrect results due to arithmetic errors. For example, if the program is supposed to calculate the square root of a number, but it uses the wrong formula, the program is producing incorrect results.
5. **Logic errors.** The program may produce incorrect results due to logic errors. For example, if the program is supposed to check if a number is prime, but it uses the wrong algorithm, the program is producing incorrect results.
6. **Memory errors.** The program may crash due to memory errors. For example, if the program allocates too much memory, it may crash.
7. **Timeout errors.** The program may crash due to timeout errors. For example, if the program is supposed to run for a certain amount of time, but it runs for longer than that, it may crash.
8. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program may be vulnerable to security attacks. For example, if the program allows users to input arbitrary code, it may be vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1205_B. Shortest Cycle

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect bitwise operation.** The bitwise AND operation is performed on two integers, and the result is an integer that is the same size as the operands. If the operands are of different sizes, the smaller operand is padded with zeros on the left to match the size of the larger operand. For example, the bitwise AND of 10 and 15 is 10, because 10 is the same size as 15.
2. **Incorrect use of the modulus operator.** The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 is 1, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1. If the divisor is zero, the modulus operator will return an error.
3. **Incorrect use of the range operator.** The range operator (..) returns a sequence of numbers from the first number to the second number, inclusive. For example, the range operator from 1 to 10 returns the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
4. **Incorrect use of the list comprehension.** A list comprehension is a concise way to create a list from an iterable. For example, the following list comprehension creates a list of the squares of the numbers from 1 to 10:
```
[n ** 2 for n in range(1, 11)]
```
5. **Incorrect use of the set comprehension.** A set comprehension is a concise way to create a set from an iterable. For example, the following set comprehension creates a set of the unique letters in the string "hello":
```
{c for c in "hello"}
```
6. **Incorrect use of the dictionary comprehension.** A dictionary comprehension is a concise way to create a dictionary from an iterable. For example, the following dictionary comprehension creates a dictionary that maps the numbers from 1 to 10 to their squares:
```
{n: n ** 2 for n in range(1, 11)}
```
7. **Incorrect use of the filter function.** The filter function returns a new iterable that contains the elements of the original iterable that satisfy a predicate function. For example, the following filter function returns a new iterable that contains the even numbers from 1 to 10:
```
filter(lambda n: n % 2 == 0, range(1, 11))
```
8. **Incorrect use of the map function.** The map function applies a function to each element of an iterable and returns a new iterable with the results of the function application. For example, the following map function returns a new iterable that contains the squares of the numbers from 1 to 10:
```
map(lambda n: n ** 2, range(1, 11))
```
9. **Incorrect use of the reduce function.** The reduce function applies a binary function to the elements of an iterable and returns a single value. For example, the following reduce function returns the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10:
```
reduce(lambda a, b: a + b, range(1, 11))
```
10. **Incorrect use of the enumerate function.** The enumerate function returns an iterable of tuples, where each tuple contains an index and the element at that index. For example, the following enumerate function returns a list of tuples that contain the indices and the elements of the list ['a', 'b', 'c']:
```
list(enumerate(['a', 'b', 'c']))
```

CODEFORCES 1221_F. Choose a Square

Pain points:
**1. Wrong input format**

The input format is not strictly defined. For example, the input may contain a space between the number of points and the first point, or the points may be separated by new lines instead of spaces. This can lead to errors in parsing the input and incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the score**

The score is calculated by summing the costs of the points covered by the square and subtracting the length of the side of the square. However, the length of the side of the square may be negative, which will lead to an incorrect score.

**3. Incorrect selection of the square**

The square must be such that its sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the lower left and upper right corners belong to the line y = x, and all corners have integer coordinates. If any of these conditions is not met, the square will not be valid and the score will be incorrect.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not strictly defined. For example, the output may contain a space between the coordinates of the corners of the square, or the corners may be separated by new lines instead of spaces. This can lead to errors in parsing the output and incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format must be exactly as specified in the problem statement. Any deviation from the specified format will result in a incorrect output. For example, if the output contains a space between the numbers, the program will produce incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that occurs when the programmer forgets to account for the fact that the index of the first element in an array is 0. For example, if the programmer is trying to access the second element in an array, they may accidentally access the first element instead. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Boundary errors**. Boundary errors occur when the programmer attempts to access an element of an array that is outside of the bounds of the array. For example, if the programmer tries to access the 10th element of an array that only has 9 elements, the program will crash.
5. **Arithmetic errors**. Arithmetic errors can occur when the programmer makes a mistake in their calculations. For example, if the programmer tries to divide by zero, the program will crash.
6. **Logic errors**. Logic errors occur when the programmer makes a mistake in their logic. For example, if the programmer assumes that a certain condition is true when it is not, the program will produce incorrect output.
7. **Memory errors**. Memory errors can occur when the programmer allocates too much memory or when they free memory that is still being used. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
8. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even the program crashing.
9. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, but neither thread is willing to release the resource first. This can lead to the program crashing or hanging indefinitely.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1461_D. Divide and Summarize

Pain points:
### Possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrect implementation of the slicing operation.** The slicing operation should divide the array into two parts, left and right, such that the left array contains all elements which are less than or equal mid, and the right array contains all elements which are greater than mid. Elements in left and right should keep their relative order from the original array.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the decision making process.** The decision of which array to keep after the slicing operation should be based on the sum of elements in the left and right arrays. The array with the smaller sum should be kept.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The slicing operation may not be possible if the array contains only one element or if the maximum and minimum elements are equal. The decision making process should also handle these edge cases correctly.
4. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The data structures used to store the array and the results of the slicing operation should be chosen carefully to optimize performance.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The code should handle errors gracefully, such as if the input data is invalid.

### How to avoid these problems and bugs

1. **Test your code thoroughly.** Write unit tests to verify that your code is correctly implementing the slicing operation and the decision making process. Also, test your code with edge cases to make sure it handles them correctly.
2. **Use a debugger to help you find bugs.** A debugger can help you track down bugs in your code by allowing you to step through your code line by line and see the values of variables as your code executes.
3. **Get help from other developers.** If you're stuck on a problem, don't be afraid to ask for help from other developers. There are many online forums and communities where you can get help with programming problems.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1538_A. Stone Game

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a list of integers. If we use the wrong data type to store the input data, it may cause problems. For example, if we use a string to store the input data, we may get a runtime error when we try to access the elements of the string.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that makes the best possible choice at each step, without considering the future consequences. In this problem, the best choice at each step is to destroy the stone with the smallest power. However, if we use a greedy algorithm that destroys the stone with the largest power, we may not get the optimal solution.

**3. Not handling special cases**

The problem statement does not mention any special cases. However, there are some special cases that we need to handle. For example, if the input data is empty, we need to return 0.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is a single integer. If we do not format the output correctly, it may cause the judge to give us a wrong answer.

**5. Coding errors**

Even if we have a correct algorithm, we may still get a wrong answer if we make coding errors. For example, we may forget to initialize a variable, or we may use the wrong operator.

**6. Runtime errors**

If we use a wrong data type or a wrong algorithm, we may get a runtime error. For example, if we try to access an element of a list that does not exist, we will get a runtime error.

2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format for this problem is also not very strict, but it is still important to make sure that you are printing the output correctly. For example, if you forget to put a space between the two numbers, the program will likely crash.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of occurrences.** The maximum number of occurrences of a number in an array can be calculated in a variety of ways. The most common way is to use a hash table to store the number of occurrences of each number in the array. However, this approach can be inefficient if the array is large. A more efficient approach is to use a binary search to find the maximum number of occurrences.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number that reaches the given maximum.** The minimum number that reaches the given maximum can be calculated in a variety of ways. The most common way is to use a binary search to find the minimum number that is greater than or equal to the given maximum. However, this approach can be inefficient if the array is large. A more efficient approach is to use a greedy algorithm to find the minimum number that reaches the given maximum.
5. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The input for this problem can contain some edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with only one element. It is important to make sure that your program handles these edge cases correctly.
6. **Incorrect use of variables.** It is important to make sure that you are using variables correctly. For example, if you accidentally assign the value of one variable to another variable, the program will likely crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 350_E. Wrong Floyd

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable initialization.** In the code, the variable `ans[i][j]` is initialized to `0` if `i == j` and to `INF` otherwise. However, the variable `ans[i][j]` should be initialized to `INF` if `i == j` and to `0` otherwise. This is because the shortest distance between a vertex and itself is always `0`.
2. **Incorrect use of the `min()` function.** In the code, the `min()` function is used to compare the values of `ans[j][r]` and `ans[j][v] + ans[v][r]`. However, the `min()` function should be used to compare the values of `ans[j][r]` and `ans[v][r]`. This is because the shortest distance between two vertices is not affected by the intermediate vertices.
3. **Incorrect use of the `for` loop.** In the code, the `for` loop is used to iterate over the values of `j` from `1` to `n`. However, the `for` loop should be used to iterate over the values of `j` from `1` to `n - 1`. This is because the shortest distance between two vertices is not affected by the last vertex.
4. **Incorrect use of the `if` statement.** In the code, the `if` statement is used to check if the value of `ans[j][r]` is less than the value of `ans[j][v] + ans[v][r]`. However, the `if` statement should be used to check if the value of `ans[j][r]` is equal to the value of `ans[j][v] + ans[v][r]`. This is because the shortest distance between two vertices is always equal to the sum of the shortest distances between the vertex and its intermediate vertices.

CODEFORCES 397_C. On Number of Decompositions into Multipliers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n, and the second line should contain space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of distinct decompositions.** The number of distinct decompositions of a positive integer m into the product of n ordered positive integers can be calculated using the following formula:

```
k = (m + n - 1)! / (m! * (n - 1)!)
```

However, if the number of distinct decompositions is very large, it may overflow the integer data type. To avoid this problem, the number of distinct decompositions can be calculated modulo a large prime number, such as 1000000007.
3. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) is used to return the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 = 1. When using the modulo operator, it is important to make sure that the dividend is less than the divisor. If the dividend is greater than the divisor, the modulo operator will return the wrong value.
4. **Incorrect use of the factorial function.** The factorial function (!) is used to calculate the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given integer. For example, 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120. When using the factorial function, it is important to make sure that the argument is a positive integer. If the argument is not a positive integer, the factorial function will return an incorrect value.
5. **Incorrect use of the bitwise operators.** The bitwise operators (&, |, ^, <<, >>) are used to perform bitwise operations on integers. For example, the bitwise AND operator (&) returns the bitwise AND of two integers. For example, 5 & 7 = 1. When using the bitwise operators, it is important to make sure that the operands are of the same data type. If the operands are of different data types, the bitwise operators will return an incorrect value.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always followed correctly, which can lead to errors in the program's execution. For example, if the number of rows or columns is not a positive integer, or if the number of peas in a square is not a digit from 0 to 9, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect logic**. The program may contain errors in its logic, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may not correctly calculate the maximum number of peas that the pawn can collect, or it may not correctly determine the best path for the pawn to take.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always followed correctly, which can make it difficult to understand the results of the program. For example, the program may not print the maximum number of peas that the pawn can collect, or it may not print the best path for the pawn to take.
4. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other potential bugs that could occur in a program that solves this problem, such as memory leaks, race conditions, and deadlocks. It is important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it is free of bugs before deploying it to production.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully follow the input format, write clear and concise code, and test the program thoroughly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 446_B. DZY Loves Modification

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input contains four integers n, m, k, and p. These integers can be very large, so we need to use the correct data type to store them. For example, we can use `int` for n and m, and `long long` for k and p.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the maximum possible total pleasure value DZY could get. We can do this by first finding the maximum sum of elements in each row and column of the matrix. Then, we can find the maximum value of k such that we can perform k modifications and still have a positive sum of elements in each row and column of the matrix. Finally, we can multiply the maximum sum of elements in each row and column by k to get the maximum possible total pleasure value DZY could get.

**3. Overflow**

When calculating the maximum sum of elements in each row and column of the matrix, we need to be careful not to overflow. We can do this by using the `unsigned long long` data type.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output should be a single integer. We can print the output using the `cout` statement.

Title:
CODEFORCES 58_C. Trees

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data contains integers, so the developer should use the `int` data type to store the values. Using a different data type, such as `float`, could lead to incorrect results.

**2. Using incorrect logic**

The problem statement states that the heights of the trees must form a beautiful sequence. This means that the heights of the trees, standing at equal distance from the edge (of one end of the sequence) must be equal to each other, and with the increasing of the distance from the edge by 1 the tree height must also increase by 1. The developer must use this logic to correctly solve the problem.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement does not specify what to do in the case of an empty input or an input with only one tree. The developer should handle these edge cases correctly.

**4. Using inefficient algorithms**

The problem can be solved in O(n) time. The developer should use an efficient algorithm to solve the problem.

**5. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code to ensure that it is correct. The developer should write unit tests to test the code.

CODEFORCES 631_B. Print Check

Pain points:
### Possible problems and bugs

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading it. For example, you might accidentally read the number of rows as the number of columns, or you might forget to read the number of operations.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when writing it. For example, you might forget to print a newline character after each row, or you might print the numbers in the wrong order.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**. The algorithm for printing the table is relatively simple, but it's easy to make a mistake when implementing it. For example, you might forget to update the colors of the cells that are already painted, or you might not check if the input is valid.
4. **Runtime errors**. The algorithm for printing the table is not very efficient, so it's possible that it will run out of time on large inputs. You can improve the runtime by using a more efficient algorithm or by parallelizing the computation.
5. **Memory errors**. The algorithm for printing the table can use a lot of memory, especially on large inputs. You can reduce the memory usage by using a more efficient algorithm or by storing the data in a more compact format.

Here are some specific examples of problems and bugs that you might encounter when solving this problem:

* You might accidentally read the number of rows as the number of columns, and then try to print the table with the wrong dimensions. This would cause the output to be incorrect.
* You might forget to update the colors of the cells that are already painted, and then print the table with incorrect colors. This would cause the output to be incorrect.
* You might not check if the input is valid, and then try to print the table with invalid data. This would cause the program to crash.
* You might use a very inefficient algorithm for printing the table, and then the program will run out of time on large inputs.
* You might use a very memory-intensive algorithm for printing the table, and then the program will run out of memory on large inputs.
Test inputs:
### Incorrect input format

```
1 1 1
1 1 1
```

This input is incorrect because the number of rows and columns do not match.

### Incorrect output format

```
1 1 1
1 1 1
```

This output is incorrect because it does not contain a newline character after each row.

### Incorrect implementation of the algorithm

```
n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
for _ in range(k):
    op, i, a = map(int, input().split())
    if op == 1:
        for j in range(m):
            print(a, end=' ')
    else:
        for j in range(n):
            print(a, end=' ')
```

This implementation is incorrect because it does not check if the input is valid. For example, it will crash if the number of rows or columns is zero.

### Runtime errors

```
n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
for _ in range(k):
    op, i, a = map(int, input().split())
    if op == 1:
        for j in range(m):
            print(a, end=' ')
    else:
        for j in range(n):
            print(a, end=' ')
```

This implementation will run out of time on large inputs because it does not use any optimizations.

### Memory errors

```
n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
for _ in range(k):
    op, i, a = map(int, input().split())
    if op == 1:
        for j in range(m):
            print(a, end=' ')
    else:
        for j in range(n):
            print(a, end=' ')
```

This implementation will use a lot of memory on large inputs because it does not use any data structures to store the table.

### Correct input format

```
3 3 3
1 1 3
2 2 1
1 2 2
```

This input is correct because the number of rows, columns, and operations are all valid.

### Correct output format

```
3 1 3 
2 2 2 
0 1 0 
```

This output is correct because it contains a newline character after each row and the numbers are correctly formatted.

### Correct implementation of the algorithm

```
n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
table = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
for _ in range(k):
    op, i, a = map(int, input().split())
    if op == 1:
        for j in range(m):
            table[i - 1][j] = a
    else:
        for j in range(n):
            table[j][i - 1] = a
for row in table:
    print(*row)
```

This implementation is correct because it correctly reads the input, checks if the input is valid, implements the algorithm correctly, and prints the output in the correct format.

### Runtime optimizations

```
n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
table = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
for _ in range(k):
    op, i, a = map(int, input().split())
    if op == 1:
        table[i - 1] = [a] * m
    else:
        table = [[table[j][i - 1] for j in range(n)] for i in range(m)]
for row in table:
    print(*row)
```

This implementation is faster than the previous one because it uses a data structure to store the table.

### Memory optimizations

```
n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
table = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
for _ in range(k):
    op, i, a = map(int, input().split())
    if op == 1:
        table[i - 1][:] = [a] * m

CODEFORCES 65_E. Harry Potter and Moving Staircases

Pain points:
```
Here are some of the most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading in the data. For example, if you forget to include a space between two numbers, or if you mistype a number, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
* **Incorrect algorithm:** The algorithm used to solve this problem is fairly complex, and it is easy to make a mistake in the implementation. For example, if you forget to update a variable correctly, or if you use the wrong data structure, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format for this problem is also very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when printing the results. For example, if you forget to include a newline character after each list of numbers, or if you mistype a number, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
* **Memory leaks:** This program uses a lot of memory, and it is easy to create a memory leak if you are not careful. For example, if you forget to free a pointer when you are finished with it, the program will continue to use that memory even after it is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
* **Synchronization issues:** This program uses multiple threads to solve the problem, and it is important to make sure that the threads are synchronized correctly. For example, if two threads try to access the same data at the same time, the program could corrupt the data or crash.
* **Race conditions:** This program also uses multiple threads, and it is important to make sure that there are no race conditions. A race condition occurs when two threads try to access the same data at the same time, and the outcome of the program depends on the order in which the threads access the data. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results or crashing.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid some of the most common problems and bugs that developers encounter when solving this problem.

HACKEREARTH game-of-strings-2

Pain points:
The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are:

1. **Incorrectly identifying the substring that satisfies the given criteria.** The developer may incorrectly identify the substring that satisfies the given criteria, resulting in an incorrect answer. This can happen if the developer does not correctly account for all of the constraints on the substring, or if the developer does not correctly implement the algorithm for finding the substring.
2. **Using an inefficient algorithm to find the substring.** The developer may use an inefficient algorithm to find the substring, resulting in a slow running time. This can happen if the developer uses a brute-force algorithm, or if the developer does not correctly optimize the algorithm for the given problem.
3. **Not handling all of the test cases correctly.** The developer may not handle all of the test cases correctly, resulting in an incorrect answer for some of the test cases. This can happen if the developer does not correctly account for all of the possible input values, or if the developer does not correctly implement the algorithm for each test case.

Title:
HACKEREARTH kings-race-8

Pain points:
**1. Wrong variable type**

When reading input, make sure to read the input correctly. For example, if the input is an integer, make sure to read it as an integer. In this problem, the input is a list of integers, so we need to read it as a list of integers.

**2. Off-by-one error**

When iterating over a list, make sure to check the bounds of the list. In this problem, we need to iterate over the list of princes and the list of hurdles. We need to make sure that we don't iterate over the list of princes one more time than the list of hurdles.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic for this problem is relatively simple. We need to iterate over the list of princes and the list of hurdles. For each prince, we need to check if the prince can jump over the hurdle. If the prince can jump over the hurdle, we need to increment the prince's score. At the end of the loop, we need to find the prince with the highest score.

**4. Undefined behavior**

When using C++, make sure to avoid undefined behavior. For example, don't use uninitialized variables. In this problem, we need to make sure that the list of princes and the list of hurdles are not empty.

**5. Memory leak**

When using C++, make sure to free any memory that you allocate. In this problem, we don't allocate any memory, so there is no memory leak.

Title:
ATCODER p02724 AtCoder Beginner Contest 160 - Golden Coins

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input `X` is an integer, but the developer may accidentally use a floating-point type. This would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may accidentally count the number of 5-yen coins incorrectly. This would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the number of 500-yen coins that Takahashi can buy. This would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
4. **Memory leak**. The developer may not properly free the memory that is allocated for the coins. This could lead to a memory leak, which could eventually cause the program to crash.
5. **Security vulnerability**. The developer may accidentally expose sensitive information, such as the user's password, to an attacker. This could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the user's account.

Title:
ATCODER p02991 AtCoder Beginner Contest 132 - Hopscotch Addict

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect graph representation**. The graph is represented as a list of edges, where each edge is a tuple of two integers. This can lead to errors if the edges are not in the correct order or if there are duplicate edges.
2. **Incorrect traversal of the graph**. The graph should be traversed in a way that ensures that all vertices are visited exactly once. This can be done using a depth-first search or a breadth-first search.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of ken-ken-pa**. The minimum number of ken-ken-pa is the number of edges in the shortest path from S to T. This can be calculated using Dijkstra's algorithm or a similar algorithm.
4. **Incorrect handling of invalid inputs**. The input should be validated to ensure that it is in the correct format. If the input is invalid, an appropriate error message should be displayed.
5. **Incorrect output formatting**. The output should be formatted in a way that is easy to read and understand. The output should also include the minimum number of ken-ken-pa, or a message indicating that Ken cannot reach T from S.

Title:
ATCODER p03132 Yahoo Programming Contest 2019 - Ears

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect understanding of the problem.**

The problem states that "Each time when Snuke passes a point with coordinate i-0.5, where i is an integer, he put a stone in his i-th ear." This means that when Snuke passes the point 0, he puts a stone in his 0th ear. However, some developers might incorrectly assume that Snuke puts a stone in his 1st ear. This would lead to an incorrect solution.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.**

The algorithm for solving this problem is relatively straightforward. However, some developers might make mistakes when implementing the algorithm. For example, they might forget to account for the fact that Snuke's ears are numbered from 0 to L-1, or they might not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required. This would lead to an incorrect solution.

**3. Incorrect testing.**

It is important to test your solution thoroughly before submitting it. This will help you to catch any errors in your code and ensure that your solution is correct. Some developers might not test their solution thoroughly enough, which could lead to them submitting an incorrect solution.

**4. Submitting the wrong solution.**

It is important to make sure that you are submitting the correct solution to the problem. Some developers might accidentally submit the wrong solution, which could lead to them receiving a incorrect score.

**5. Not reading the problem carefully enough.**

The problem statement is very important. It contains all of the information that you need to solve the problem. Some developers might not read the problem carefully enough, which could lead to them making mistakes.
Test inputs:
**Incorrect understanding of the problem**

Title:
ATCODER p03275 AtCoder Beginner Contest 107 - Median of Medians

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect sorting**

The median of a sequence is the middle element when the sequence is sorted. If the sequence is not sorted correctly, the median will be incorrect. For example, the median of the sequence `[10, 30, 20]` is `20`, but the median of the sequence `[30, 10, 20]` is `10`.

**2. Using the wrong formula for the median**

The formula for the median of a sequence of length `N` is `(N + 1) / 2`. For example, the median of the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is `3`. However, some developers may mistakenly use the formula `N / 2` instead, which would give the incorrect answer of `2`.

**3. Not handling edge cases correctly**

Some edge cases to be aware of include:

* The sequence is empty.
* The sequence has only one element.
* The sequence has two elements.
* The sequence has an odd number of elements.
* The sequence has an even number of elements.

**4. Using inefficient algorithms**

There are a number of efficient algorithms for finding the median of a sequence. Some of the most common algorithms include:

* The quickselect algorithm
* The merge sort algorithm
* The heap sort algorithm

**5. Not using the right data structures**

The data structure used to store the sequence can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm used to find the median. Some of the most common data structures for storing sequences include:

* Arrays
* Linked lists
* Skip lists
* Hash tables

**6. Not using the right programming language**

The programming language used to implement the algorithm can also have a significant impact on the performance. Some programming languages are better suited for certain tasks than others. For example, C++ is a good choice for performance-critical applications, while Python is a good choice for rapid development.

Title:
ATCODER p03432 AtCoder Grand Contest 021 - Trinity

Pain points:
**1. Off-by-one errors**

The most common bug when solving a problem like this is to make an off-by-one error. For example, you might accidentally count the number of black squares in the first row as N instead of N - 1. This can lead to incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect handling of boundary conditions**

Another common bug is to incorrectly handle boundary conditions. For example, you might assume that the first row and column of the grid are always black, when in fact they might not be. This can also lead to incorrect results.

**3. Using the wrong modulo**

When working with modulo arithmetic, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct modulo. For example, if you are asked to find the number of triples (A, B, C) modulo 998244353, you need to make sure that you are using the modulo 998244353 in all of your calculations. Otherwise, you will get the wrong answer.

**4. Using the wrong data type**

Another common bug is to use the wrong data type. For example, if you are asked to find the number of triples (A, B, C), you should use an integer data type to store the values of A, B, and C. Otherwise, you might get the wrong answer.

**5. Not using enough precision**

When working with large numbers, it is important to use enough precision. For example, if you are asked to find the number of triples (A, B, C), you should use at least 100 digits of precision. Otherwise, you might get the wrong answer.

Pain points:
1. The input string may not be in the correct format. For example, it could contain non-alphabetic characters or be longer than 10 characters.
2. The developer may not correctly check whether the string starts with `YAKI`. For example, they may not check that the first three characters are `Y`, `A`, and `K`, respectively.
3. The developer may not correctly output the correct answer. For example, they may print `Yes` when the string does not start with `YAKI` or `No` when the string does start with `YAKI`.

Title:
ATCODER p03748 AtCoder Grand Contest 013 - Piling Up

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect modular arithmetic**

When working with large numbers, it is important to be careful about modular arithmetic. For example, if you are working modulo 10^9+7, then the expression `(a+b)%10^9+7` is not the same as `a%10^9+7 + b%10^9+7`. This is because `(a+b)%10^9+7` can potentially overflow and wrap around to a smaller number. To avoid this problem, you can use the following trick:

```
(a+b)%10^9+7 = ((a%10^9+7) + (b%10^9+7))%10^9+7
```

**2. Off-by-one errors**

When counting the number of possible sequences of colors, it is important to be careful about off-by-one errors. For example, if you are counting the number of ways to arrange 3 red balls and 2 blue balls, you might accidentally count the arrangement `RBBB` twice, once as `RBB` and once as `BRB`. To avoid this problem, you can use the following trick:

```
count = count + 1
count %= 10**9+7
```

**3. Incorrect use of memoization**

Memoization is a technique that can be used to speed up recursive algorithms. However, it is important to use memoization correctly. For example, if you are writing a recursive function to count the number of ways to arrange a set of objects, you might accidentally memoize the value of the function for a subproblem that has already been solved. This can lead to an infinite loop. To avoid this problem, you can use the following trick:

```
if memo[state] is None:
    memo[state] = dfs(state)
return memo[state]
```

**4. Incorrect use of bitmasks**

Bitmasks can be a powerful tool for solving problems involving combinatorics. However, it is important to use bitmasks correctly. For example, if you are using a bitmask to represent the state of a problem, you might accidentally set a bit that you did not mean to set. This can lead to incorrect results. To avoid this problem, you can use the following trick:

```
mask |= (1 << i)
```

Title:
ATCODER p03910 CODE FESTIVAL 2016 Final - Exactly N points

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input type**. The input type of `N` is `int`, but the user may accidentally input a string. This will cause a `TypeError`.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the highest score**. The highest score is the maximum value of the scores of the problems that Takahashi solves. The user may accidentally calculate the sum of the scores instead of the maximum value. This will cause the wrong answer.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a list of the indices of the problems that Takahashi solves, one per line. The user may accidentally output the scores of the problems instead of the indices. This will cause the wrong answer.
4. **Incorrect handling of duplicate solutions**. The problem statement states that "if there exists more than one such set, any of them will be accepted". The user may accidentally only output one of the solutions. This will cause the wrong answer.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input type, the calculation of the highest score, the output format, and the handling of duplicate solutions.

AIZU p00014 Integral

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect rounding**. When computing the area of each rectangle, the developer may incorrectly round the values. This can lead to a significant error in the final answer.
2. **Inaccurate computation of the number of rectangles**. The developer may incorrectly compute the number of rectangles that need to be added up to approximate the area of the shape. This can also lead to a significant error in the final answer.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the integral**. The developer may incorrectly implement the integral that is used to compute the area of the shape. This can lead to a significant error in the final answer.
4. **Incorrect input validation**. The developer may not properly validate the input data. This can lead to errors such as dividing by zero or computing the area of a shape that does not exist.
5. **Incorrect output formatting**. The developer may not properly format the output of the program. This can make it difficult for the user to understand the results.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as expected. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be in the correct order.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the mean**. The mean is calculated by adding all the numbers and dividing by the number of numbers. However, if there are any missing numbers, the mean will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the standard deviation**. The standard deviation is calculated by taking the square root of the variance. The variance is calculated by subtracting the mean from each number, squaring the result, and then adding all the squared results together. Dividing this sum by the number of numbers minus 1 gives the variance. Taking the square root of the variance gives the standard deviation.
4. **Incorrect rounding of the final answer**. The final answer should be rounded to 3 decimal places.
5. **Incorrect error handling**. If there is an error in the input, the program should handle the error gracefully and output an appropriate error message.

Title:
AIZU p01066 Reflection Warp Machine

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format of the problem is not very clear. It is not clear whether the input should be a list of numbers or a list of tuples. This can lead to errors if the developer is not careful.

For example, if the input is a list of numbers, the developer might accidentally try to access the elements of the list using square brackets, which will cause an error.

```
>>> input()
[0, 0, 0, 0]
>>> input[0]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range
```

Instead, the developer should use the `enumerate()` function to iterate over the list of numbers. This will ensure that the elements of the list are accessed correctly.

```
>>> input()
[0, 0, 0, 0]
>>> for i, num in enumerate(input):
...     print(i, num)
... 
0 0
1 0
2 0
3 0
```

### 2. Incorrect output format

The output format of the problem is also not very clear. It is not clear whether the output should be a single number or a list of numbers. This can lead to errors if the developer is not careful.

For example, if the output is a single number, the developer might accidentally try to print the number as a list, which will cause an error.

```
>>> n = 3
>>> x0, y0 = 0, 0
>>> x1, y1 = 0, 1
>>> x2, y2 = 1, 0
>>> lines = 2
>>> print(lines)
2
>>> print([lines])
['2']
```

Instead, the developer should use the `int()` function to convert the number to a string.

```
>>> n = 3
>>> x0, y0 = 0, 0
>>> x1, y1 = 0, 1
>>> x2, y2 = 1, 0
>>> lines = 2
>>> print(str(lines))
2
```

### 3. Incorrect algorithm

The algorithm used to solve the problem is also important. If the algorithm is not correct, the developer will not get the correct answer.

For example, the following algorithm is incorrect:

```
def solve(n, x0, y0, x1, y1, x2, y2):
    if n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return 2
```

This algorithm will always return the same answer, regardless of the input. This is because the algorithm does not take into account the fact that the stars can be visited in any order.

A correct algorithm would take into account the order in which the stars are visited. For example, the following algorithm is correct:

```
def solve(n, x0, y0, x1, y1, x2, y2):
    if n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        # Find the line that passes through the first two stars.
        slope = (y1 - y0) / (x1 - x0)
        b = y0 - slope * x0

        # Check if the third star lies on the line.
        if y2 == slope * x2 + b:
            return 1
        else:
            return 2
```

This algorithm takes into account the fact that the stars can be visited in any order. It first finds the line that passes through the first two stars. Then, it checks if the third star lies on the line. If it does, the algorithm returns 1. Otherwise, the algorithm returns 2.

### 4. Incorrect data types

The data types used in the problem are also important. If the data types are not correct, the developer will not be able to solve the problem correctly.

For example, the following code will not work:

```
n = int(input())
x0, y0 = map(int, input().split())
x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())
x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())

lines = solve(n, x0, y0, x1, y1, x2, y2)

print(lines)
```

This code will not work because the `map()` function returns a list of strings, not a list of integers.
Test inputs:
**Incorrect input format**

```
n = 3
x0, y0 = 0, 0
x1, y1 = 0, 1
x2, y2 = 1, 0
lines = 2
print(lines)
```

**Incorrect output format**

```
n = 3
x0, y0 = 0, 0
x1, y1 = 0, 1
x2, y2 = 1, 0
lines = 2
print(lines)
```

**Incorrect algorithm**

```
n = 3
x0, y0 = 0, 0
x1, y1 = 0, 1
x2, y2 = 1, 0
lines = 2
print(lines)
```

**Incorrect data types**

```
n = '3'
x0, y0 = '0', '0'
x1, y1 = '0', '1'
x2, y2 = '1', '0'
lines = 2
print(lines)
```

AIZU p01199 Flame of Nucleus

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input format specifies that the first line of each test case contains three integers N, M and L. However, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect data format**

The input format specifies that the first line of each test case contains three integers N, M and L. However, if the input contains a line with fewer than three integers, the program will crash.

**3. Off-by-one error**

The program may incorrectly calculate the maximum number of people who can survive. For example, the program may assume that a person can reach a shelter in L - 1 days, when in fact the person can only reach the shelter in L days.

**4. Undefined behavior**

The program may exhibit undefined behavior if it is passed invalid input. For example, the program may crash if it is passed a negative number as input.

**5. Memory leak**

The program may leak memory if it does not properly free the memory that it allocates. This can lead to a decrease in performance and an increase in the risk of a memory-related error.

**6. Race condition**

The program may exhibit a race condition if two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or a crash.

**7. Deadlock**

The program may deadlock if two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can prevent the program from making progress and can lead to a crash.

**8. Security vulnerability**

The program may contain a security vulnerability if it allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code. This can allow the attacker to take control of the system or steal sensitive data.

AIZU p01336 THE BYDOLM@STER

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not well-defined. For example, it is not clear how to handle the case where the number of biddles is 0.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not well-defined. For example, it is not clear how to handle the case where the maximum rank is 0.
3. **Incorrect data type**. The data types of some of the input values are not well-defined. For example, it is not clear whether the cost of hiring a biddle should be an integer or a floating-point number.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. There are a number of places in the code where it is possible to make off-by-one errors. For example, when iterating over the list of biddles, it is possible to accidentally skip a biddle or count a biddle twice.
5. **Memory leaks**. The code does not properly free the memory that it allocates. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
6. **Race conditions**. The code does not properly synchronize access to shared data. This can lead to race conditions, which can cause the program to produce incorrect results.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. The code does not properly check the validity of user input. This can allow attackers to exploit the program to gain unauthorized access to the system.

Title:
AIZU p01503 Tampopo Machine

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly using the `pow()` function.** The `pow()` function raises a number to a given power. In this problem, we need to calculate the product of the first five Fibonacci numbers. The first five Fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, and 5. So, the product of the first five Fibonacci numbers is 1 * 1 * 2 * 3 * 5 = 120. However, if we incorrectly use the `pow()` function, we might calculate the wrong answer. For example, if we use the following code:

```
product = pow(1, 5)
```

we will get the incorrect answer of 1.

2. **Using the wrong data type.** The input to this problem is a list of integers. However, if we incorrectly use the wrong data type, we might get a wrong answer. For example, if we use the following code:

```
product = 1
for num in nums:
    product *= num
```

we will get a wrong answer because the variable `product` is a float, not an integer.

3. **Not using the correct order of operations.** In mathematics, the order of operations is important. For example, in the expression `2 + 3 * 4`, the multiplication operation is performed before the addition operation. However, if we incorrectly use the wrong order of operations, we might get a wrong answer. For example, if we use the following code:

```
product = 1
for num in nums:
    product += num * num
```

we will get a wrong answer because the multiplication operation is performed after the addition operation.

4. **Using a floating-point number instead of an integer.** In this problem, we need to calculate the product of the first five Fibonacci numbers. The first five Fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, and 5. These numbers are all integers. However, if we incorrectly use a floating-point number, we might get a wrong answer. For example, if we use the following code:

```
product = 1.0
for num in nums:
    product *= num
```

we will get a wrong answer because the variable `product` is a floating-point number, not an integer.

5. **Using an infinite loop.** If we incorrectly write the code, we might create an infinite loop. For example, if we use the following code:

```
while True:
    pass
```

this code will create an infinite loop.

AIZU p02238 Depth First Search

Pain points:
### Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrectly implementing the DFS algorithm.** The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm, so it is important to make sure that the recursive calls are made correctly. One common mistake is to forget to update the `d` and `f` values of the vertices as they are visited. Another common mistake is to not handle the case where a vertex has no adjacent vertices.
2. **Using an incorrect data structure to represent the graph.** The DFS algorithm requires that the graph be represented in a way that allows for efficient traversal. A common mistake is to use an adjacency list representation, which can be inefficient for graphs with many vertices. A better choice would be to use an adjacency matrix representation.
3. **Incorrectly handling the case where there are multiple sources for the DFS.** The DFS algorithm can be started from any vertex in the graph. However, it is important to make sure that all of the vertices in the graph are eventually visited. One common mistake is to only visit the vertices that are directly connected to the source vertex.
4. **Incorrectly handling the case where there are cycles in the graph.** The DFS algorithm can detect cycles in a graph. However, it is important to make sure that the algorithm does not get stuck in an infinite loop when it encounters a cycle. One common mistake is to not handle the case where a vertex is visited more than once.
5. **Incorrectly handling the case where the graph is disconnected.** The DFS algorithm can be used to find the connected components of a graph. However, it is important to make sure that the algorithm does not get stuck in an infinite loop when it encounters a disconnected graph. One common mistake is to not handle the case where a vertex is not connected to any other vertices.

### Tips for avoiding these problems and bugs:

1. **Test your code thoroughly.** The best way to avoid problems and bugs is to test your code thoroughly. This means testing your code with a variety of different inputs and ensuring that it produces the correct output.
2. **Use a debugger.** A debugger can be a helpful tool for debugging problems with your code. A debugger allows you to step through your code line by line and see how it is executing. This can help you identify problems and bugs that might be difficult to find otherwise.
3. **Consult with other developers.** If you are stuck on a problem, don't be afraid to ask for help from other developers. Other developers may have encountered the same problem and may be able to help you find a solution.
4. **Use online resources.** There are a number of online resources available that can help you learn about the DFS algorithm and how to implement it correctly. These resources can be a helpful way to supplement your learning and to ensure that you are implementing the algorithm correctly.

Title:
AIZU p02384 Dice II

Pain points:
**1. The input may not be valid.** For example, the input may contain duplicate integers, or the number of integers may not be 6. The developer should check the input for validity and raise an error if it is not valid.
2. The developer may not correctly implement the algorithm for rolling the dice. The algorithm for rolling the dice is as follows:
    1. Start with the dice in the following orientation:
        * Top face: 1
        * Front face: 2
        * Right side face: 3
        * Back face: 4
        * Left side face: 5
        * Bottom face: 6
    2. Roll the dice by rotating it 90 degrees clockwise.
    3. The new top face is the old front face, the new front face is the old right side face, and so on.
3. The developer may not correctly print the output. The output should be a single integer, which is the number on the right side face of the dice.
4. The developer may not handle errors correctly. For example, if the input is not valid, the developer should raise an error. If the developer does not handle errors correctly, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer may incorrectly check the input for validity. For example, the developer may not check for duplicate integers or for the number of integers being 6.
* The developer may incorrectly implement the algorithm for rolling the dice. For example, the developer may not rotate the dice by 90 degrees clockwise.
* The developer may incorrectly print the output. For example, the developer may print more than one integer or may print a non-integer value.
* The developer may not handle errors correctly. For example, the developer may not raise an error when the input is not valid.
