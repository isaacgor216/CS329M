Title:
CODECHEF abcstr

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input string may contain characters other than A, B, and C.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer.
3. **Off-by-one error**. When counting the number of substrings, it is easy to make a mistake and count one substring twice or miss one substring.
4. **Time complexity**. The time complexity of the algorithm should be O(N), where N is the length of the input string.
5. **Space complexity**. The space complexity of the algorithm should be O(1).

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. Use regular expressions to validate the input string.
2. Use a data structure that supports efficient counting, such as a hash table or a trie.
3. Carefully check your code for off-by-one errors.
4. Use a big-O analysis to determine the time and space complexity of your algorithm.
5. Test your code thoroughly to catch any bugs.

Title:
CODECHEF cheflr

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable types.** The problem statement is about a binary tree. We need to be careful about the types of the variables we use to represent the tree. For example, if we use an integer array to represent the tree, we need to make sure that the array is large enough to hold all the nodes in the tree.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When traversing a binary tree, it is easy to make off-by-one errors. For example, if we are traversing the tree in preorder, we need to make sure that we increment the index of the current node before we visit its left child.
3. **Incorrect traversal order.** The problem statement specifies that the nodes of the tree are enumerated in a certain order. We need to make sure that we traverse the tree in the correct order.
4. **Incorrect base case.** The problem statement specifies that the root node of the tree is numbered 1. We need to make sure that we handle this case correctly.
5. **Incorrect modulo operation.** The problem statement specifies that the output should be modulo 10^9+7. We need to make sure that we perform the modulo operation correctly.

Title:
CODECHEF nita10

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) should be used to ensure that the answer is a whole number. For example, if the answer is 14, the modulo operator should be used to return 14 % 100003, which is 14.
2. **Incorrect use of the factorial function.** The factorial function (n!) should be used to calculate the number of ways in which n objects can be arranged. For example, the factorial of 4 is 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.
3. **Incorrect use of the binomial coefficient.** The binomial coefficient (n, k) should be used to calculate the number of ways in which n objects can be chosen from a set of k objects. For example, the binomial coefficient of 4, 2 is (4, 2) = 4! / 2! / 2! = 6.
4. **Incorrect use of the permutation function.** The permutation function (n, k) should be used to calculate the number of ways in which n objects can be arranged in a specific order. For example, the permutation of 4 objects taken 2 at a time is (4, 2) = 4! / 2! = 12.
5. **Incorrect use of the combination function.** The combination function (n, k) should be used to calculate the number of ways in which n objects can be chosen from a set of k objects without regard to order. For example, the combination of 4 objects taken 2 at a time is (4, 2) = 4! / 2! / 2! = 6.
6. **Incorrect use of the recursive function.** The recursive function should be used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems. For example, the problem of finding the number of ways in which n objects can be arranged can be solved recursively by finding the number of ways in which n - 1 objects can be arranged and then adding one.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1000_G. Two-Paths

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that can be used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. The algorithm works by iteratively computing the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices, starting with the shortest paths between each vertex and itself. In each iteration, the algorithm considers all pairs of vertices that are not yet connected by a shortest path and tries to find a shorter path between them. This process is repeated until all pairs of vertices are connected by a shortest path.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm.** The Bellman-Ford algorithm is another dynamic programming algorithm that can be used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. The algorithm works by iteratively updating the distances from a given source vertex to all other vertices in the graph. In each iteration, the algorithm considers all edges in the graph and updates the distances from the source vertex to the vertices that are reachable from the source vertex via those edges. This process is repeated until the distances from the source vertex to all other vertices in the graph converge to their final values.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm.** The Dijkstra algorithm is a greedy algorithm that can be used to find the shortest paths between a single source vertex and all other vertices in a weighted graph. The algorithm works by iteratively adding the vertex with the smallest distance from the source vertex to a set of visited vertices. The algorithm then updates the distances from the source vertex to all other vertices that are reachable from the newly added vertex. This process is repeated until all vertices in the graph have been visited.
4. **Incorrect implementation of the Prim's algorithm.** The Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that can be used to find a minimum spanning tree in a weighted graph. The algorithm works by iteratively adding the edge with the smallest weight that connects two vertices that are not already part of the minimum spanning tree. This process is repeated until all vertices in the graph are part of the minimum spanning tree.
5. **Incorrect implementation of the Kruskal's algorithm.** The Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that can be used to find a minimum spanning tree in a weighted graph. The algorithm works by iteratively adding the edge with the smallest weight that does not create a cycle in the graph. This process is repeated until all vertices in the graph are connected by a minimum spanning tree.

**Some additional tips for debugging your code:**

1. **Use a debugger to step through your code and identify the source of the error.** A debugger can be a helpful tool for debugging your code, as it allows you to see the values of variables and the state of the program at each step. This can help you to identify the source of the error and to fix it.
2. **Print out the values of key variables at each step of your code.** This can help you to track the flow of your code and to identify the point at which the error occurs.
3. **Use a unit testing framework to test your code.** A unit testing framework can be a helpful tool for testing your code, as it allows you to test individual units of code in isolation. This can help you to identify errors in your code early on, before they cause problems in your production code.
4. **Ask for help from other developers.** If you are stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help from other developers. There are many online forums and communities where you can get help with your coding problems.

CODEFORCES 1180_A. Alex and a Rhombus

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n. If the input format is not followed, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely produce an incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of cells in the rhombus.** The number of cells in a rhombus of order n is given by the formula `n^2 + (n - 1)^2`. If this formula is not used correctly, the program will not be able to correctly calculate the number of cells and will likely produce an incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the number of cells in the rhombus, it is important to make sure that all of the cells are counted correctly. A common error is to forget to count the cells in the corners of the rhombus.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer, which is the number of cells in the rhombus. If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to produce a correct output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1215_F. Radio Stations

Pain points:
Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correct, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.
* **Incorrect data type:** The data type of a variable may be incorrect, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if a variable is declared as an integer but is assigned a value that is not an integer, the program may crash.
* **Off-by-one error:** An off-by-one error occurs when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can cause the program to skip over or repeat a statement, which may lead to incorrect output.
* **Logic error:** A logic error occurs when the program is not doing what the programmer intended it to do. This can be caused by a mistake in the algorithm or by a misunderstanding of the problem.
* **Memory leak:** A memory leak occurs when a program does not release memory that it is no longer using. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
* **Race condition:** A race condition occurs when two or more parts of the program are trying to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect output or even a crash.
* **Deadlock:** A deadlock occurs when two or more parts of the program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish because it is waiting for the other one. This can lead to the program running indefinitely or crashing.

By being aware of these possible problems and bugs, developers can write code that is more robust and less likely to crash or produce incorrect output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1300_C. Anu Has a Function

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the bitwise OR operation.** The bitwise OR operation is performed using the `|` operator in C++. However, this operator can also be used to perform string concatenation, which can lead to incorrect results. To avoid this problem, you should use the `std::bitset<>` class to represent bitwise operations.
2. **Incorrect handling of negative numbers.** The bitwise OR operation is not defined for negative numbers. If you try to perform a bitwise OR operation on two negative numbers, you will get an incorrect result. To avoid this problem, you should check if either of the numbers is negative before performing the bitwise OR operation.
3. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The bitwise OR operation can overflow if the two operands are too large. To avoid this problem, you should check if the result of the bitwise OR operation is greater than the maximum value of an integer before storing it in a variable.
4. **Incorrect use of the `std::sort()` function.** The `std::sort()` function sorts a vector in ascending order by default. If you want to sort a vector in descending order, you need to pass the `std::greater<>` function as the second argument to the `std::sort()` function.
5. **Incorrect use of the `std::max()` function.** The `std::max()` function returns the maximum value of two arguments. If you want to find the maximum value of a vector, you need to pass the vector as the first argument to the `std::max()` function.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. Use the `std::bitset<>` class to represent bitwise operations. This will prevent you from accidentally performing string concatenation.
2. Check if either of the numbers is negative before performing the bitwise OR operation.
3. Check if the result of the bitwise OR operation is greater than the maximum value of an integer before storing it in a variable.
4. Pass the `std::greater<>` function as the second argument to the `std::sort()` function to sort a vector in descending order.
5. Pass the vector as the first argument to the `std::max()` function to find the maximum value of a vector.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1343_C. Alternating Subsequence

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data contains integers of very large absolute values. If you use incorrect data types to store these integers, you may get incorrect results. For example, if you use `int` to store integers of absolute value greater than `2147483647`, you will get incorrect results.

**2. Using incorrect algorithms**

The problem asks you to find the maximum sum of an alternating subsequence. There are many different algorithms that you can use to solve this problem. However, some algorithms are more efficient than others. For example, the dynamic programming algorithm is more efficient than the brute force algorithm.

**3. Making mistakes in your implementation**

Even if you use the correct data types and algorithms, you may still make mistakes in your implementation. For example, you may forget to initialize a variable, or you may make a mistake in a calculation. These mistakes can lead to incorrect results.

**4. Not handling special cases**

The problem statement specifies some special cases. For example, the problem statement states that the input data contains no zeros. If you do not handle these special cases correctly, you may get incorrect results.

2. To avoid problems with missing or extra input, you should check the input carefully before you use it. This can be done by using a function that checks for the presence of a required field or by using a function that checks for the end of the input.
3. To avoid problems with unexpected input, you should handle unexpected values gracefully. This can be done by using a function that checks for out-of-range values or by using a function that checks for malformed input.
4. To avoid inefficient code, you should use algorithms that are designed for the problem you are solving. You should also use data structures that are appropriate for the problem you are solving.
5. To avoid incorrect code, you should test your code thoroughly. You should test your code with both valid and invalid input. You should also test your code with different types of input.
6. To avoid insecure code, you should follow secure coding practices. This includes using secure coding techniques, such as input validation and output encoding. You should also use secure libraries and frameworks.

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not specified clearly. For example, it is not clear whether the coordinates of the segments are separated by spaces or commas. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the area of the rectangle**. The area of a rectangle is calculated as the product of its width and height. However, if the segments are not parallel to the coordinate axes, the width and height of the rectangle will not be equal, and the area will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect checking of the orientation of the segments**. The segments forming a rectangle must be parallel to the coordinate axes. This can be checked by comparing the slopes of the segments.
4. **Incorrect handling of degenerate cases**. The segments forming a rectangle can degenerate into points. This case must be handled separately.
5. **Incorrect output**. The output must be the word "YES" if the four segments form a rectangle, and the word "NO" otherwise.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1523_H. Hopping Around the Array 

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect array indexing.** When iterating over the array, it is important to make sure that the indices are in bounds. For example, in the following code, the index `i + a[i]` could be greater than the length of the array, causing an out-of-bounds error:

```
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  for (int j = i + a[i]; j < n; j++) {
    // Do something with a[j]
  }
}
```

2. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement specifies that the first and last cells cannot be removed. However, the following code does not check for this condition, which could lead to an incorrect answer:

```
int k_grasshopper(int l, int r, int k) {
  // Check if the first or last cell is being removed
  if (l == 0 || r == n - 1) {
    return INT_MAX;
  }

  // Continue with your solution
}
```

3. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem statement specifies that the array can have a maximum length of 20000. However, the following code uses a vector with a capacity of 10000, which could lead to an out-of-memory error:

```
vector<int> a(10000);
```

4. **Incorrect algorithm design.** The following algorithm is incorrect for the given problem:

```
int k_grasshopper(int l, int r, int k) {
  // Initialize the minimum number of hops
  int min_hops = INT_MAX;

  // Iterate over all possible subarrays of length k
  for (int i = l; i < r - k + 1; i++) {
    // Find the maximum number of hops from the first cell to the last cell in the subarray
    int max_hops = 0;
    for (int j = i; j < i + k; j++) {
      max_hops = max(max_hops, a[j]);
    }

    // Update the minimum number of hops
    min_hops = min(min_hops, max_hops);
  }

  // Return the minimum number of hops
  return min_hops;
}
```

This algorithm is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the grasshopper can jump to any cell with indices from `i` to `i + a[i]` inclusive. As a result, the algorithm may return an incorrect answer.

5. **Incorrect implementation.** The following code is incorrect because it does not properly handle the case where the subarray is empty:

```
int k_grasshopper(int l, int r, int k) {
  // Check if the subarray is empty
  if (l == r) {
    // Return 0 if the subarray is empty
    return 0;
  }

  // Otherwise, continue with your solution
}
```

In this case, the algorithm should return INT_MAX, as there is no way for the grasshopper to reach the last cell from the first cell in zero hops.

Title:
CODEFORCES 156_B. Suspects

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**

The input format is "n m" followed by "n" lines of input. For example, the input "1 1\n+1" is correct, but "1 1\n+1 2" is not correct.

**2. The output format is not correct**

The output format is "n" lines of output. For example, the output "Truth\nLie" is correct, but "Truth\nLie\n" is not correct.

**3. The program does not output the correct answer**

The program may output the wrong answer for some inputs. For example, the following program outputs the wrong answer for the input "1 1\n+1":

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
for i in range(n):
    if i == m:
        print("Truth")
    else:
        print("Lie")
```

**4. The program does not handle the corner cases**

The program may not handle the corner cases correctly. For example, the following program does not handle the case where `n == 1` correctly:

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
for i in range(n):
    if i == m:
        print("Truth")
    else:
        print("Lie")

CODEFORCES 177_F1. Script Generation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may not have 3 space-separated integers on the first line, or it may have more than k lines of input.
2. **Incorrect data.** The input data may not be correct. For example, the number of men and women may not be equal, or the number of marriages may be greater than the number of men and women, or the input may contain duplicate pairs of (h, w).
3. **Mathematical errors.** The algorithm may not be correct mathematically. For example, the algorithm may not return the correct value of the t-th acceptable set.
4. **Runtime errors.** The algorithm may not run in time. For example, the algorithm may use an inefficient data structure or algorithm.
5. **Memory errors.** The algorithm may not run in memory. For example, the algorithm may use an excessively large data structure.

To avoid these problems, carefully read the problem statement and make sure that your input format is correct. Also, check the data for correctness and make sure that your algorithm is mathematically correct and runs in time and memory.

Title:
CODEFORCES 199_C. About Bacteria

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible that the user will enter the data in an incorrect format. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the number of seconds**

The number of seconds required to grow at least z bacteria can be calculated using the following formula:

```
seconds = (z - t) / (k + b)
```

However, if the user enters a value for z that is less than t, the denominator of this formula will be negative, which will cause the program to crash.

**3. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is possible that the user will enter the output in an incorrect format. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

**4. Other bugs**

There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem, such as:

* Using the wrong data type for a variable
* Forgetting to initialize a variable
* Using an incorrect operator
* Making a logical error in the code

By carefully following the instructions and avoiding these common pitfalls, you can reduce the chances of encountering bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 222_D. Olympiad

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a space instead of a comma, the program may not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect variable type.** The variable type must be declared correctly, otherwise the program may not be able to perform the correct operations. For example, if a variable is declared as an integer but is used to store a floating-point number, the program may produce incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors occur when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to errors in the program's output. For example, if a programmer is counting the number of elements in an array, they may forget to increment the counter by one after each iteration, which will result in one element being missed.
4. **Logic errors.** Logic errors occur when the programmer makes a mistake in the logic of the program. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results, even if the input format and variable types are correct. For example, if a programmer is sorting an array, they may forget to check for duplicates, which could lead to the array being sorted incorrectly.
5. **Indexing errors.** Indexing errors occur when a programmer accesses an element of an array using an incorrect index. This can lead to the program accessing an invalid element of the array, which could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. For example, if a programmer tries to access the element at index 10 of an array that only has 5 elements, the program will crash.

CODEFORCES 271_C. Secret

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is specified in the problem statement. Make sure that your code correctly parses the input.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also specified in the problem statement. Make sure that your code correctly formats the output.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The problem statement gives a clear definition of what a safe secret is. Make sure that your code correctly implements this definition.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Be careful when doing arithmetic operations with indices. It is easy to make a mistake and get the wrong answer.
5. **Memory errors**. Make sure that your code does not allocate too much memory. The problem statement specifies a limit on the input size.
6. **Time errors**. Make sure that your code runs within the time limit specified in the problem statement.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that you might encounter when solving this problem:

* You might incorrectly assume that the input is always valid. For example, you might assume that the number of words in the secret is always greater than the number of keepers. This is not always the case, and your code will crash if you try to handle this case.
* You might incorrectly implement the definition of a safe secret. For example, you might forget to check that the elements of each set do not form an arithmetic progression. This will cause your code to output incorrect results.
* You might make an off-by-one error when computing the indices of the words in the secret. This will cause your code to output incorrect results.
* You might allocate too much memory when storing the sets of words. This will cause your code to run out of memory and crash.
* You might not run your code within the time limit specified in the problem statement. This will cause your code to be marked as incorrect.

By carefully following the problem statement and avoiding these common pitfalls, you can solve this problem correctly.
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect input format**

```
10 2
```

This input is invalid because it does not have two integers separated by a single space.

2. **Incorrect output format**

```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

This output is incorrect because it does not have the correct number of integers. The output should be n integers, where n is the number of words in the secret.

3. **Incorrect logic**

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())

if n % k != 0:
    print(-1)
else:
    for i in range(k):
        print(i + 1, end=" ")
```

This code is incorrect because it does not check if the elements of each set form an arithmetic progression.

4. **Off-by-one errors**

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())

sets = []
for i in range(k):
    sets.append([])

for i in range(1, n + 1):
    sets[i % k].append(i)

for set in sets:
    if len(set) < 3:
        print(-1)
        exit()
    for i in range(len(set) - 1):
        if set[i + 1] - set[i] != 1:
            print(-1)
            exit()

for i in range(k):
    print(i + 1, end=" ")
```

This code is incorrect because it does not check if the sets are disjoint.

5. **Memory errors**

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())

sets = []
for i in range(k):
    sets.append([])

for i in range(1, n + 1):
    sets[i % k].append(i)

for set in sets:
    if len(set) < 3:
        print(-1)
        exit()
    for i in range(len(set) - 1):
        if set[i + 1] - set[i] != 1:
            print(-1)
            exit()

for i in range(k):
    print(i + 1, end=" ")
```

This code is incorrect because it allocates too much memory. The sets could potentially contain all of the numbers from 1 to n, which is more than 10^6.

6. **Time errors**

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())

sets = []
for i in range(k):
    sets.append([])

for i in range(1, n + 1):
    sets[i % k].append(i)

for set in sets:
    if len(set) < 3:
        print(-1)
        exit()
    for i in range(len(set) - 1):
        if set[i + 1] - set[i] != 1:
            print(-1)
            exit()

for i in range(k):
    print(i + 1, end=" ")
```

This code is incorrect because it runs too slowly. The time complexity is O(n^2), which is too slow for large values of n.

2. **Incorrect data type**. The problem states that the input should contain integers. However, if the input contains a floating-point number, the program will crash.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The problem states that the first line of the input contains an integer n denoting the number of cities in the empire. However, if the program assumes that the first line contains n+1 cities, it will produce an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect algorithm**. The problem states that the goal is to find the minimum sum of pairwise distances between the cities. However, if the program uses an algorithm that does not find the minimum sum, it will produce an incorrect answer.
5. **Memory leak**. The program may allocate memory that it does not free, which can lead to a memory leak.
6. **Race condition**. The program may access shared data without synchronization, which can lead to a race condition.
7. **Deadlock**. The program may enter a deadlock state, where it is unable to continue execution.
8. **Buffer overflow**. The program may write data to a buffer that is not large enough, which can lead to a buffer overflow.
9. **Format string vulnerability**. The program may use a format string that is not properly escaped, which can lead to a format string vulnerability.

CODEFORCES 342_C. Cupboard and Balloons

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect calculation of the number of balloons.** The developer may incorrectly calculate the number of balloons that can fit in the cupboard by assuming that the balloons are all the same size. In reality, the balloons can be different sizes, and the number of balloons that can fit in the cupboard will vary depending on the size of the balloons.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the volume of the balloons.** The developer may incorrectly calculate the volume of the balloons by assuming that they are perfect spheres. In reality, the balloons may be misshapen or have non-uniform densities, and the volume of the balloons will vary depending on their shape and density.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the area of the cupboard.** The developer may incorrectly calculate the area of the cupboard by assuming that it is a perfect rectangle. In reality, the cupboard may have rounded corners or other irregularities, and the area of the cupboard will vary depending on its shape.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of balloons.** The developer may incorrectly calculate the maximum number of balloons that can fit in the cupboard by assuming that the balloons are arranged in a perfect grid. In reality, the balloons may be arranged in a more chaotic manner, and the maximum number of balloons that can fit in the cupboard will vary depending on their arrangement.
5. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The developer may incorrectly implement the solution by making a mistake in the code. This could be due to a typo, a logic error, or a misunderstanding of the problem.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that they understand the problem before starting to code. The developer should also carefully check their code for errors before submitting it.

Title:
CODEFORCES 581_C. Developing Skills

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly followed, which can lead to errors in the program's logic. For example, if the input contains a space between two integers, the program may misinterpret the input and produce an incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The input data may be of the wrong type, which can also lead to errors in the program's logic. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program may try to convert the string to an integer, which will fail and produce an incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that occurs when the programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a program that outputs the wrong answer or a program that crashes.
4. **Indexing errors.** Indexing errors occur when the programmer accesses an element of an array or list using the wrong index. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a program that outputs the wrong answer or a program that crashes.
5. **Logic errors.** Logic errors occur when the programmer makes a mistake in the logic of the program. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a program that outputs the wrong answer or a program that crashes.
6. **Memory errors.** Memory errors occur when the programmer allocates too much or too little memory for a program. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a program that outputs the wrong answer or a program that crashes.
7. **Synchronization errors.** Synchronization errors occur when multiple threads in a program try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a program that outputs the wrong answer or a program that crashes.
8. **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks occur when two or more threads in a program are waiting for each other to release a resource, which prevents any of the threads from continuing execution. This can lead to a program that hangs or crashes.
9. **Race conditions.** Race conditions occur when the outcome of a program depends on the order in which two or more threads execute. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a program that outputs the wrong answer or a program that crashes.

Title:
CODEFORCES 603_B. Moodular Arithmetic

Pain points:
 1. **Incorrect implementation of the modular arithmetic operations.** This is the most common mistake that programmers make when solving problems involving modular arithmetic. It is important to remember that when performing modular arithmetic operations, the result must always be reduced modulo the modulus. For example, if you are working modulo 10, then the result of 11 + 12 is not 23, but rather 3.
2. **Incorrect handling of negative numbers.** When working with modular arithmetic, it is important to remember that negative numbers do not exist. For example, if you are working modulo 10, then the value -5 does not exist. If you try to perform an arithmetic operation on a negative number, the result will be undefined.
3. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** When working with large numbers, it is possible to overflow the data type that you are using. For example, if you are working with integers, then the largest possible integer is 2^31 - 1. If you try to store a number that is larger than this, the result will be undefined.
4. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, if you divide 10 by 3, the remainder is 1. The modulo operator is often used to check if a number is divisible by another number. For example, you can check if a number is divisible by 3 by using the following code:
```
if (number % 3 == 0) {
  // The number is divisible by 3.
} else {
  // The number is not divisible by 3.
}
```
5. **Incorrect use of the exponentiation operator.** The exponentiation operator (**) raises a number to a power. For example, 2^3 is equal to 8. The exponentiation operator is often used to calculate factorials. For example, you can calculate the factorial of 5 using the following code:
```
factorial = 1;
for (i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  factorial *= i;
}
```
6. **Incorrect use of the factorial function.** The factorial function (factorial()) returns the factorial of a number. For example, factorial(5) is equal to 120. The factorial function is often used to calculate permutations and combinations. For example, you can calculate the number of permutations of a set of 5 elements using the following code:
```
permutations = factorial(5);
```
7. **Incorrect use of the combination function.** The combination function (combinations()) returns the number of combinations of a set of n elements taken k at a time. For example, combinations(5, 3) is equal to 10. The combination function is often used to calculate probabilities. For example, you can calculate the probability of getting 3 heads in 5 coin flips using the following code:
```
probability = combinations(5, 3) / factorial(5);
```

CODEFORCES 625_E. Frog Fights

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly handling the case where a frog's jump length is greater than the number of cells on the gameboard.** This could result in the frog jumping off the end of the gameboard and being removed from the game, even if it would not have been knocked out by another frog.
2. **Not correctly updating the jump lengths of frogs that are knocked out by other frogs.** This could result in a frog being able to jump further than it should be able to, or in a frog being unable to jump at all.
3. **Not correctly handling the case where two or more frogs are knocked out by the same frog.** This could result in the frogs being removed from the game in the wrong order, or in some frogs being removed from the game even though they should not have been.
4. **Not correctly handling the case where a frog's jump length is reduced to zero.** This could result in the frog being removed from the game even though it should not have been.
5. **Not correctly handling the case where a frog's jump length becomes negative.** This could result in the frog being removed from the game even though it should not have been.
6. **Not correctly handling the case where the gameboard is empty.** This could result in the program crashing or producing an incorrect output.
7. **Not correctly handling the case where the input data is invalid.** This could result in the program crashing or producing an incorrect output.
8. **Not using efficient algorithms to solve the problem.** This could result in the program running slowly or using too much memory.

Title:
CODEFORCES 64_G. Path Canonization

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the path must start with a slash (`/`) and consist of elements separated by slashes. If the input does not match this format, the program will not be able to correctly parse the path and will produce an incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect use of the `.` and `..` characters.** The `.` character represents the current directory, and the `..` character represents the parent directory. If these characters are used incorrectly, the program will not be able to correctly parse the path and will produce an incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect handling of special cases.** There are a few special cases that the program must handle correctly. For example, the program must be able to handle the case where the path is empty, the case where the path is a single slash, and the case where the path contains two consecutive slashes.
4. **Memory errors.** The program must be careful not to allocate too much memory, or it will crash. This is especially important when the input path is long.
5. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the path must not contain any special characters. If the output does contain special characters, the program will produce an incorrect output.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a negative value for `c`.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be either `"YES"` or `"NO"`.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may accidentally calculate the index of `b` incorrectly. For example, if `b` is the first element of the sequence, the developer may incorrectly calculate its index as `0` instead of `1`.
4. **Infinite loop**. The developer may accidentally create an infinite loop in their code. This could happen if the developer does not check for the termination condition of the loop.
5. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may implement the incorrect logic to solve the problem. For example, the developer may incorrectly check if `b` appears in the sequence.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test your code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 879_C. Short Program

Pain points:
### Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect use of bitwise operators.** Bitwise operators are powerful but also easy to misuse. For example, the following code will not work as expected:

```
x = 10
y = 20
print(x & y)
```

This code will print `0`, because the `&` operator returns the bitwise AND of two numbers, which means that only the bits that are set in both numbers will be set in the result. In this case, neither `x` nor `y` has any bits set in common, so the result is `0`.

* **Using the wrong data type.** The bitwise operators only work on integers, so if you try to use them on a floating-point number, you will get an error. For example, the following code will not work:

```
x = 10.5
y = 20.5
print(x & y)
```

This code will throw an error because `x` and `y` are floating-point numbers, and the bitwise operators only work on integers.

* **Not understanding the precedence of bitwise operators.** The bitwise operators have a specific order of precedence, which means that some operators will be evaluated before others. For example, the following code will not work as expected:

```
x = 10
y = 20
print(x | y & 1)
```

This code will print `10`, because the `|` operator has a higher precedence than the `&` operator. This means that the `|` operator will be evaluated first, and the result of that will be ANDed with `1`.

* **Using bitwise operators to perform arithmetic operations.** The bitwise operators are not designed for performing arithmetic operations. For example, the following code will not work as expected:

```
x = 10
y = 20
print(x + y)
```

This code will print `30`, because the `+` operator is not a bitwise operator. To perform arithmetic operations, you should use the arithmetic operators, such as `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.

* **Not using parentheses to group expressions.** Parentheses can be used to group expressions together, which can help to improve the readability of your code and to avoid errors. For example, the following code is more readable than the previous example:

```
x = 10
y = 20
print((x | y) & 1)
```

This code uses parentheses to group the `|` operator and the `&` operator together, which makes it clear that the `|` operator should be evaluated first.

* **Not understanding the limitations of bitwise operators.** The bitwise operators can only be used on integers that are less than or equal to 255. If you try to use them on an integer that is greater than 255, you will get an error.

Title:
CODEFORCES 925_A. Stairs and Elevators

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly and in the correct order. For example, if you were to read the input as `n, m, c_l, c_e, v`, you would get the number of floors, the number of sections, the number of stairs, the number of elevators, and the maximum speed of an elevator, respectively. However, the correct input format is `n, m, c_l, c_e, v`. This means that the number of floors, the number of sections, the number of stairs, the number of elevators, and the maximum speed of an elevator should be read in that order.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also very specific. It is important to make sure that you are printing the output in the correct order and with the correct formatting. For example, if you were to print the output as `1, 2, 3`, you would be printing the first query answer, the second query answer, and the third query answer, respectively. However, the correct output format is `1\n2\n3`. This means that the first query answer should be printed on its own line, followed by the second query answer on its own line, and so on.

**3. Using the wrong data type**

It is important to use the correct data type for each variable in your program. For example, if you were to declare the variable `n` as an integer, you would not be able to store the value `10^8` in it. This is because the maximum value that an integer can store is `2^31 - 1`. However, if you declared the variable `n` as a long long integer, you would be able to store the value `10^8` in it.

**4. Using the wrong algorithm**

The algorithm that you use to solve this problem is very important. If you use the wrong algorithm, you will not get the correct answer. For example, if you were to use a brute force algorithm to solve this problem, you would not be able to solve it in time. However, if you were to use a dynamic programming algorithm, you would be able to solve it in time.

**5. Not handling special cases correctly**

There are a few special cases that you need to handle correctly when solving this problem. For example, if the number of stairs or elevators is zero, you need to handle that case correctly. Additionally, if the maximum speed of an elevator is zero, you need to handle that case correctly as well.

**6. Making a mistake in your code**

Even the best programmers make mistakes in their code. It is important to carefully check your code for mistakes before submitting it. For example, you might accidentally mistype a variable name or forget to close a bracket. These types of mistakes can be difficult to find, but they can have a big impact on the correctness of your program.

**7. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it. This will help you to identify any errors in your code and fix them before it is too late. There are a few different ways to test your code. You can manually test it, or you can use a unit testing framework.

2. **Not considering the case where the necklace is not a circle.** The problem statement states that the necklace should remain as one circular part of the same length as the initial necklace. This means that you cannot simply remove links or pearls from the necklace and then rejoin them in a different order.
3. **Not handling the case where the necklace contains only links or only pearls.** The problem statement states that the necklace must contain at least one pearl. If the necklace contains only links or only pearls, then you cannot make the number of links between adjacent pearls equal.
4. **Using a brute-force approach to solve the problem.** The problem can be solved in polynomial time, so there is no need to use a brute-force approach.
5. **Not using the most efficient data structures to solve the problem.** The problem can be solved efficiently using a linked list or a hash table.

Title:
HACKEREARTH in-love-with-primes

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly checking if a number is prime.** A common mistake is to check if a number is prime by dividing it by all numbers from 2 to the square root of the number. However, this is not correct because some numbers, such as 11, are only divisible by 1 and themselves, but are not prime because they are divisible by 11. The correct way to check if a number is prime is to divide it by all prime numbers less than or equal to its square root.
2. **Using an incorrect algorithm to find prime numbers.** There are many different algorithms for finding prime numbers. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. The most efficient algorithm for finding prime numbers is the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
3. **Not handling edge cases correctly.** Some edge cases to be aware of when solving this problem include:
    * The input number may be 1, which is not prime.
    * The input number may be even, which cannot be represented as the sum of two prime numbers.
    * The input number may be divisible by a prime number greater than 2, which means that it cannot be represented as the sum of two prime numbers.
4. **Not using efficient data structures.** Using efficient data structures can help to improve the performance of your code. For example, using a hash table to store prime numbers can help to speed up the process of finding prime numbers.
5. **Not using idiomatic code.** Idiomatic code is code that is written in a way that is consistent with the style of the language being used. Using idiomatic code can help to make your code more readable and easier to maintain.
6. **Not testing your code.** It is important to test your code to ensure that it is working correctly. This can be done by writing unit tests or integration tests. Unit tests test individual units of code, while integration tests test how different units of code work together.

HACKEREARTH matching-strings-4

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one errors.** When comparing two strings, it is easy to make a mistake and compare the wrong index. This can lead to incorrect results, such as thinking that two strings are similar when they are not.
2. **Incorrect handling of special characters.** Some programming languages have special characters that have a different meaning than regular characters. For example, in Python, the backslash character (`\`) is used to escape special characters. If a developer is not careful, they may accidentally compare two strings that differ only in the use of special characters.
3. **Incorrect handling of case sensitivity.** By default, strings in most programming languages are case-sensitive. This means that the strings "apple" and "APPLE" are considered to be different. If a developer is not careful, they may accidentally compare two strings that differ only in case.
4. **Incorrect handling of trailing spaces.** When comparing two strings, it is important to make sure that they are both trimmed of any trailing spaces. Otherwise, two strings that are identical except for trailing spaces may be considered to be different.
5. **Incorrect handling of leading spaces.** Similar to trailing spaces, it is important to make sure that two strings are both trimmed of any leading spaces. Otherwise, two strings that are identical except for leading spaces may be considered to be different.
6. **Incorrect handling of non-characters.** Some programming languages allow strings to contain non-characters, such as control characters. If a developer is not careful, they may accidentally compare two strings that differ only in the use of non-characters.
7. **Incorrect handling of empty strings.** The empty string, "", is a special case that can cause problems when comparing strings. For example, the expression "a" == "" evaluates to True, even though the two strings are not identical.
8. **Incorrect handling of infinite strings.** Some programming languages allow strings to be infinite in length. If a developer is not careful, they may accidentally compare two strings that are infinite in length. This can lead to incorrect results, such as thinking that two strings are similar when they are not.
9. **Incorrect handling of strings with embedded null characters.** Some programming languages allow strings to contain null characters. If a developer is not careful, they may accidentally compare two strings that differ only in the use of null characters. This can lead to incorrect results, such as thinking that two strings are similar when they are not.

Title:
ATCODER p02544 ACL Contest 1 - Shuffle Window

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The most common mistake when solving this problem is to implement the algorithm incorrectly. This can lead to incorrect results or even a runtime error.

**2. Using incorrect data types**

Another common mistake is to use incorrect data types. For example, if you are working with large numbers, you should use a data type that can represent them accurately. Otherwise, you may get incorrect results.

**3. Not handling edge cases correctly**

It is important to handle edge cases correctly when solving any problem. For example, if the input is invalid, you should handle it gracefully. Otherwise, your program may crash or give incorrect results.

**4. Using inefficient algorithms**

Using inefficient algorithms can lead to slow runtimes. For example, if you are sorting a large list, you should use a sorting algorithm that is designed for large lists. Otherwise, your program may take a long time to run.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it. This will help you catch any bugs that you may have missed. Otherwise, your program may not work as expected.
Test inputs:

ATCODER p02803 AtCoder Beginner Contest 151 - Maze Master

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a 2D array of characters. If we try to use a 2D array of integers, we will get a `TypeError`.

**2. Using the wrong index**

The input data is a 2D array, so we need to use two indexes to access each element. If we use the wrong index, we will get a `IndexError`.

**3. Not handling the edge cases**

The input data may contain empty rows or columns. If we don't handle these edge cases, our code will break.

**4. Not considering all possible paths**

When we are finding the maximum possible number of moves, we need to consider all possible paths. If we only consider a few paths, our answer will be incorrect.

**5. Using inefficient algorithms**

There are more efficient ways to find the maximum possible number of moves. If we use an inefficient algorithm, our code will run slowly.

Title:
ATCODER p02939 AtCoder Grand Contest 037 - Dividing a String

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input string can be very long, so it's important to use a data type that can store it. For example, using a `char` array would not be enough, as it can only store a limited number of characters. Instead, you should use a `string` object.

**2. Not handling invalid input**

The input string may not be valid. For example, it may contain characters that are not lowercase English letters. In this case, you should handle the invalid input gracefully. For example, you could print an error message and exit the program.

**3. Splitting the string into substrings incorrectly**

The problem requires you to split the string into substrings such that each substring is non-empty and different from the next substring. There are a few ways to do this, but one common way is to use the `str.split()` method. This method takes a delimiter as an argument, and it splits the string into substrings based on that delimiter. In this case, you would use the empty string as the delimiter, so that the string is split into individual characters.

**4. Not finding the maximum possible value of K**

The problem asks you to find the maximum possible value of K. To do this, you need to iterate through all possible values of K and find the largest one that satisfies the condition. One way to do this is to use a `for` loop.

**5. Printing the output incorrectly**

The output should be a single integer, which is the maximum possible value of K. You can print the output using the `print()` function.

Title:
ATCODER p03076 AtCoder Beginner Contest 123 - Five Dishes

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect variable type**

The problem states that the input is five integers between 1 and 123 (inclusive). However, if the developer incorrectly defines the input variables as floats, the program will not work correctly. For example, if the developer defines the input variables as `float a, b, c, d, e`, the program will not be able to handle inputs such as `123.0`.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The problem states that the output should be an integer. However, if the developer incorrectly defines the output variable as a float, the program will not work correctly. For example, if the developer defines the output variable as `float result`, the program will not be able to handle outputs such as `215`.

**3. Off-by-one error**

The problem states that the time to serve a dish is the time between when an order is placed and when the dish is delivered. However, if the developer incorrectly calculates the time to serve a dish by subtracting the order time from the delivery time, the program will not work correctly. For example, if the developer calculates the time to serve a dish as `delivery_time - order_time`, the program will not be able to handle orders that are placed at the exact time when the previous dish is delivered.

**4. Incorrect logic**

The problem states that the earliest possible time for the last dish to be delivered is the minimum of the delivery times of all five dishes. However, if the developer incorrectly calculates the minimum of the delivery times, the program will not work correctly. For example, if the developer calculates the minimum of the delivery times as `min(delivery_time_1, delivery_time_2, ..., delivery_time_5)`, the program will not be able to handle cases where two or more of the delivery times are equal.

**5. Uninitialized variables**

The problem states that the developer can order the dishes in any order he likes. However, if the developer does not initialize the variables that store the order times of the dishes, the program will not be able to track the order of the dishes. For example, if the developer defines the variables that store the order times of the dishes as `int order_time_1, order_time_2, order_time_3, order_time_4, order_time_5`, the program will not be able to handle orders that are placed at the exact time when the previous dish is delivered.

ATCODER p03529 CODE FESTIVAL 2017 Final - Mancala

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the game rules.** The player may not always be able to perform the operation as many times as desired. For example, if all squares contain 0 stones, the player cannot perform the operation at all.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the final score.** The final score is not simply the total number of stones remaining in the squares. For example, if the player removes all the stones from Square 1, the final score is not 0.
3. **Incorrect modulo operation.** The answer may not be a multiple of 1000000007. For example, if the answer is 1000000008, the correct answer is 1.
4. **Incorrect input format.** The input may not be in the correct format. For example, if the input is "2 3 4", the first two numbers should be N and K, respectively.
5. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer, which is the sum of f(a) modulo 1000000007. For example, if the sum is 1000000008, the output should be 1.

**2. Incompatible elements**

The elements of the two sequences may not be compatible. For example, if one sequence contains an element that is larger than 2^30, the output should be `-1`.

**3. Incorrect XOR values**

The XOR of the elements in the first sequence may not be equal to the XOR of the elements in the second sequence. If this is the case, the output should be `-1`.

**4. Infeasible number of operations**

The number of operations required to match the two sequences may be greater than the number of elements in the first sequence. If this is the case, the output should be `-1`.

**5. Incorrect output format**

The output should be a single integer. If the output is not a single integer, the solution is incorrect.

Title:
ATCODER p04010 AtCoder Grand Contest 004 - Namori

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect graph representation**

The first step is to represent the graph. A common mistake is to represent the graph as an adjacency list or adjacency matrix. However, this is not sufficient for this problem, as we need to know the number of times each edge is traversed. To do this, we can represent the graph as a list of edges, where each edge is represented by a tuple (u, v, c), where u and v are the vertices that the edge connects, and c is the number of times the edge is traversed.

**2. Incorrect traversal of the graph**

Once the graph is represented, the next step is to traverse the graph and count the number of times each edge is traversed. A common mistake is to simply iterate over the edges and increment the count for each edge. However, this will not work correctly if there are multiple edges between the same two vertices. To fix this, we need to keep track of the previous vertex that we visited, and only increment the count for an edge if the current vertex is different from the previous vertex.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of operations**

Once we have counted the number of times each edge is traversed, we can calculate the minimum number of operations required to turn all the vertices black. A common mistake is to simply add up the number of times each edge is traversed. However, this will not work correctly if there are multiple edges between the same two vertices. To fix this, we need to subtract the number of times each edge is traversed from the number of vertices in the graph.

**4. Incorrect handling of disconnected graphs**

The problem statement states that the graph is connected. However, it is possible for a graph to be disconnected, even if it has N-1 edges. If the graph is disconnected, then it is not possible to turn all the vertices black. To check if the graph is connected, we can use a depth-first search or a breadth-first search.

**5. Incorrect handling of graphs with self-loops**

The problem statement states that there are no self-loops in the graph. However, it is possible for a graph to have self-loops. If the graph has self-loops, then it is not possible to turn all the vertices black. To check if the graph has self-loops, we can iterate over all the vertices and check if there is an edge from the vertex to itself.

Title:
AIZU p01146 Princess in Danger

Pain points:
The following are possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is not very clear. It is not immediately obvious what each of the six non-negative integers in the first line of each dataset represents. Additionally, the list of freezing facilities and the list of roads connecting towns are not clearly separated. This could lead to the developer incorrectly parsing the input and producing incorrect results.
* **Incorrect data type assumptions:** The input data is given as a series of integers. However, the developer may incorrectly assume that some of the data is of a different type, such as a string or a floating-point number. This could lead to the developer incorrectly processing the data and producing incorrect results.
* **Off-by-one errors:** The problem statement specifies that the capital of the home country and the hospital where the princess was transported are different towns. However, the developer may incorrectly assume that they are the same town. This could lead to the developer incorrectly calculating the shortest route from the capital to the hospital and producing incorrect results.
* **Incorrect logic:** The problem statement requires the developer to find the shortest route from the capital to the hospital while maintaining the freshness of the blood. The developer may incorrectly implement the logic for this and produce incorrect results.
* **Inefficient algorithms:** The problem statement requires the developer to find the shortest route from the capital to the hospital. This can be done using a variety of algorithms, some of which are more efficient than others. The developer may choose an inefficient algorithm, which could lead to slow runtimes and incorrect results.

By avoiding these problems and bugs, the developer can increase the likelihood of producing correct and efficient solutions to this problem.

Title:
AIZU p02037 Tile

Pain points:
**1. The developer may not correctly understand the problem statement.** The problem statement is quite long and detailed, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading it. For example, the developer may not realize that the tiles cannot be stacked, or that they cannot be rotated.

**2. The developer may not correctly implement the algorithm.** The algorithm for solving this problem is not particularly complex, but there are a few details that the developer needs to get right. For example, the developer needs to make sure that the tiles are placed in a way that maximizes the area that is not covered by the tiles.

**3. The developer may not correctly test the code.** It is important to test the code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. The developer should test the code with a variety of input values, and make sure that the output is correct in each case.

**4. The developer may not correctly handle errors.** The code should be able to handle errors gracefully. For example, the code should be able to handle the case where the input is invalid.

**5. The developer may not correctly document the code.** The code should be well-documented so that other developers can understand it. The documentation should include a description of the problem that the code solves, an overview of the algorithm, and a detailed explanation of the code.

Title:
AIZU p02181 AOR-String

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of "AOR" substrings.** One common mistake is to simply count the number of occurrences of each letter in each string, and then add them up. However, this will not give the correct answer, because it is possible for two or more "AOR" substrings to overlap. For example, if the input is "AORA" and "OR", then the correct answer is 2, not 3.
2. **Not considering all possible orderings of the strings.** Another common mistake is to only consider the ordering of the strings that results in the maximum number of "AOR" substrings. However, it is possible that there are other orderings that also result in the maximum number of "AOR" substrings. For example, if the input is "AORA" and "OR", then the ordering "AORAOR" also results in 2 "AOR" substrings.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others, so it is important to choose the right algorithm for the given problem.
4. **Incorrectly implementing the algorithm.** Even if you choose the right algorithm, you still need to implement it correctly. This is where most bugs occur. Make sure to carefully read the algorithm and understand how it works before you start implementing it.
5. **Not handling all possible input cases.** Make sure to test your code with a variety of input cases, including cases where the input is invalid or the output is incorrect. This will help you to identify and fix any bugs in your code.

AIZU p02323 Traveling Salesman Problem

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the number of vertices and edges may not be separated by a space, or the edges may not be in the format `s0 t0 d0`.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The vertices and edges may not be integers. For example, the vertices may be strings or the edges may have non-integer values.

**3. Missing or duplicate edges**

The input may not contain all the edges, or it may contain duplicate edges.

**4. No solution**

There may be no solution to the traveling salesman problem. For example, if the graph is disconnected, there is no way to visit all the vertices in a single cycle.

**5. Inefficient algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve the problem may be inefficient. For example, a brute-force algorithm would take exponential time to find the shortest route.

**6. Incorrect output**

The output may not be the shortest distance. For example, the algorithm may find a suboptimal solution or it may not terminate.

Title:
AIZU p02468 Power

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) in Python returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 returns 1. However, in this problem, we need to find the remainder when mn is divided by 1,000,000,007. To do this, we can use the following code:

```python
mn % 1000000007
```

2. **Incorrect use of the factorial function.** The factorial function (math.factorial()) in Python returns the product of all the integers from 1 to a given number. For example, math.factorial(5) returns 120. However, in this problem, we need to find the factorial of mn. To do this, we can use the following code:

```python
math.factorial(mn)
```

3. **Incorrect use of the exponentiation operator.** The exponentiation operator (**) in Python raises a number to a given power. For example, 2 ** 3 returns 8. However, in this problem, we need to find the product of mn. To do this, we can use the following code:

```python
mn * mn
