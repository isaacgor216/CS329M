Title:
CODECHEF iitk2p06

Pain points:
1. The developer may not be familiar with the problem statement and may make mistakes in interpreting it. For example, they may think that the goal is to make the ratio of even to odd numbers as close to 2 : 3 as possible, when in reality the goal is to make the ratio exactly 2 : 3.
2. The developer may not be familiar with the math required to solve the problem. For example, they may not know how to find the minimum number of operations needed to change the ratio of even to odd numbers.
3. The developer may make a mistake in their implementation of the solution. For example, they may forget to account for the fact that the ratio of even to odd numbers can never be greater than 2 : 3.
4. The developer may not test their solution thoroughly enough. For example, they may only test their solution on a few small test cases, when in reality the solution may not work on all possible test cases.
5. The developer may not submit their solution in the correct format. For example, they may not include the correct header or footer, or they may not format their code correctly.

Title:
CODECHEF ndungeon

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type.** The input data is given as a string, but the problem requires the data to be integers. This can be fixed by using the `int()` function to convert the string to an integer.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** The code may check if the princess is in the same row or column as the prince, but forget to check if the princess is in the same cell as the prince. This can be fixed by checking if the princess's row and column are equal to the prince's row and column.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The code may check if the prince can reach the princess in time, but forget to take into account the time it takes to kill the guards in the princess's cell. This can be fixed by adding the time it takes to kill the guards to the prince's travel time.
4. **Infinite loops.** The code may enter an infinite loop if it does not check if the prince has reached the princess. This can be fixed by adding a condition to the loop that checks if the prince has reached the princess.
5. **Memory leaks.** The code may not release memory that is no longer needed. This can be fixed by using the `del` keyword to delete objects that are no longer needed.
6. **Race conditions.** The code may not be thread-safe. This can be fixed by using locks to protect shared data.
7. **Security vulnerabilities.** The code may not be secure. This can be fixed by using proper input validation and escaping of user input.

CODEFORCES 1023_E. Down or Right

Pain points:
    **Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs**

1. **Incorrect Input**

The input format is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake. For example, you might accidentally write "n = 4" instead of "n = 5". This would cause your program to crash.
2. **Incorrect Output**

The output format is also very specific. You need to make sure that your output is exactly the same as the example output. For example, you might accidentally write "! RRRDD" instead of "! RDRRDD". This would cause your program to get a Wrong Answer verdict.
3. **Invalid Queries**

You are only allowed to ask queries with the manhattan distance between the two cells at least n - 1. If you ask a query with a smaller manhattan distance, your program will receive an error message and will be terminated.
4. **Infinite Loop**

Your program should terminate after printing the solution. If your program enters an infinite loop, it will be terminated by the judge and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.
5. **Memory Limit Exceeded**

Your program should not use more than the allowed amount of memory. If your program exceeds the memory limit, it will be terminated by the judge and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.

**Tips for Solving This Problem**

1. **Read the problem carefully**

The problem statement is very long, but it is important to read it carefully so that you understand all of the details.
2. **Test your code**

Once you have written your code, it is important to test it to make sure that it works correctly. You can test your code on the sample input and output.
3. **Use a debugger**

A debugger can help you to find bugs in your code. You can use a debugger to step through your code line by line and to watch the values of variables change.
4. **Ask for help**

If you are stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help. There are many online resources available, including forums, chat rooms, and online tutorials.

Pain points:
 * \{5, 6\} 
  * \{5, 6\} 
  * \{6\} 
  * \{6\}
Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect implementation of the DFS algorithm.** The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that visits all vertices of a graph in a depth-first order. It is important to correctly implement the DFS algorithm, as any errors in the implementation could lead to incorrect results.
* **Incorrect identification of good vertices.** A good vertex is a vertex from which a DFS can be performed to produce the spanning tree T. It is important to correctly identify good vertices, as any errors in the identification could lead to incorrect results.
* **Incorrect handling of updates to the graph.** The updates to the graph can change the set of good vertices. It is important to correctly handle these updates, as any errors in the handling could lead to incorrect results.
* **Incorrect output of the results.** The output of the results should be a list of the number of good vertices after each update. It is important to correctly format the output, as any errors in the formatting could lead to incorrect results.

By following these tips, you can avoid these common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1067_E. Random Forest Rank

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly, and that you are not making any mistakes when parsing the data.

For example, if you were to accidentally read the first line of input as "3 1 2 3", you would end up with a tree with 3 vertices, but with edges connecting vertices 1 and 2, and vertices 2 and 3. This would be incorrect, as the problem states that the input graph must be a tree.

**2. Incorrect edge traversal order**

When traversing the edges of a tree, it is important to do so in a consistent order. This is because the expected rank of a forest is dependent on the order in which the edges are deleted.

For example, if you were to delete the edge between vertices 1 and 2, and then the edge between vertices 2 and 3, the resulting forest would have a different rank than if you had deleted the edge between vertices 1 and 3, and then the edge between vertices 2 and 3.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the expected rank**

The expected rank of a forest can be calculated by summing the expected ranks of all of the individual trees that make up the forest.

For example, if you have a forest with two trees, each with a rank of 3, the expected rank of the forest would be 3 + 3 = 6.

**4. Incorrect modulo operation**

The final answer to this problem must be modulo 998244353. This means that any values that are greater than or equal to 998244353 must be reduced modulo 998244353.

For example, if the expected rank of the forest is 1000000000, the final answer would be 1000000000 % 998244353 = 6533.

**5. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem must be a single integer. This integer should be the expected rank of the forest, modulo 998244353.

For example, if the expected rank of the forest is 6533, the output would be 6533.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single string. However, if the input contains multiple lines, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the output should be a single integer. However, if the output contains multiple integers or non-numeric characters, the program will produce an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program should find the minimum number of cuts needed to get a new name. However, if the program's logic is incorrect, it may output an incorrect answer.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The program may incorrectly count the number of cuts needed to get a new name. This can happen if the program does not account for the fact that the original string is a palindrome.
5. **Memory leaks**. The program may not properly release memory that it has allocated. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions**. The program may not be thread-safe. This can lead to incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.

CODEFORCES 1138_E. Museums Tour

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correct. For example, the number of cities `n` is not an integer, or the number of roads `m` is negative.
2. **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correct. For example, the output is not an integer, or the output is not a positive number.
3. **Incorrect data:** The data is incorrect. For example, there is a road from city `A` to city `B`, but there is no road from city `B` to city `A`.
4. **Incorrect algorithm:** The algorithm is incorrect. For example, the algorithm does not find the maximum number of distinct museums that can be visited.
5. **Incorrect implementation:** The implementation of the algorithm is incorrect. For example, the algorithm uses a data structure that is not efficient for the problem.

Here are some tips to avoid these problems:

1. **Be careful with the input format.** Make sure that the input format is correct. You can use a tool like [Parsec](https://github.com/solaire/parsec) to parse the input format.
2. **Be careful with the output format.** Make sure that the output format is correct. You can use a tool like [PPrint](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html) to print the output in a human-readable format.
3. **Check the data for correctness.** Make sure that the data is correct. You can use a tool like [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) to check the data for correctness.
4. **Design a correct algorithm.** The algorithm should find the maximum number of distinct museums that can be visited. You can use a greedy algorithm or a dynamic programming algorithm.
5. **Implement the algorithm efficiently.** The implementation of the algorithm should be efficient. You can use a data structure like [a priority queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue) to implement the algorithm efficiently.

CODEFORCES 1156_G. Optimizer

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable names.** The variable names in the input program must be valid, i.e., they must consist of 1 to 4 characters, and each character must be a lowercase or an uppercase Latin letter, or a digit. Additionally, the first character of a variable name must not be a digit.
2. **Incorrect operations.** The operations in the input program must be one of the following characters: $, ^, #, or &.
3. **Missing or incorrect assignments.** Each variable in the input program must be assigned a value at least once. Additionally, the assignment to a variable must be of the form `<lvalue>=<rvalue>`, where `<lvalue>` and `<rvalue>` are valid variable names.
4. **Undeclared variables.** A variable that is used in the input program must be declared before it is used.
5. **Circular dependencies.** A circular dependency occurs when a variable is assigned a value that depends on the value of another variable, which in turn depends on the value of the first variable. Circular dependencies are not allowed in the input program.
6. **Other errors.** There may be other errors in the input program that are not listed here.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. Additionally, it is helpful to test the input program with a few different values to make sure that it is correct.

CODEFORCES 1179_A. Valeriy and Deque

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the deque data structure.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. The deque data structure must be implemented correctly in order to ensure that the elements are inserted and deleted from both ends of the deque in the correct order.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm for finding the two elements that Valeriy will pull out of the deque.** The algorithm for finding the two elements that Valeriy will pull out of the deque must be implemented correctly in order to ensure that the correct elements are returned.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement specifies a number of edge cases that must be handled correctly. For example, the problem statement states that the number of elements in the deque must be at least 2, and the number of queries must be at most 3 * 10^5. Developers must ensure that their code handles these edge cases correctly.
4. **Incorrect input validation.** The problem statement specifies that the input must be a valid deque of integers. Developers must ensure that their code validates the input correctly and raises an error if the input is invalid.
5. **Incorrect output formatting.** The problem statement specifies that the output must be two integers, separated by a space. Developers must ensure that their code formats the output correctly.

**Additional tips:**

* When implementing the deque data structure, it is helpful to use a doubly linked list. This will make it easier to insert and delete elements from both ends of the deque.
* When implementing the algorithm for finding the two elements that Valeriy will pull out of the deque, it is helpful to use a stack. This will allow you to keep track of the elements that have already been pulled out of the deque.
* When handling edge cases, it is helpful to use a switch statement. This will make it easy to check for all of the possible edge cases.
* When validating the input, it is helpful to use the `isdigit()` function. This function will return `True` if the input is a valid integer, and `False` otherwise.
* When formatting the output, it is helpful to use the `print()` function. This function will print the output to the console.

CODEFORCES 1255_E2. Send Boxes to Alice (Hard Version)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input is a list of integers, but the code is using a list of strings. This will cause errors when trying to perform mathematical operations on the list.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The code is iterating over the list of integers one element too many, which will cause the final result to be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code is not taking into account the fact that the boxes can be empty. This means that it is possible for the code to return a negative number, which is incorrect.
4. **Uncaught exception**. The code is not handling the case where the list of integers is empty. This will cause the code to crash.
5. **Infinite loop**. The code is not checking for a condition that would terminate the loop, which could cause the code to run indefinitely.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully check your code for errors before submitting it. Here are some tips:

CODEFORCES 1426_D. Non-zero Segments

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n, and the second line should contain n integers. If the input format is not correct, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the output should be a single integer, the minimum number of integers that need to be inserted into the array. If the output format is not correct, the program will not produce the correct answer.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of integers to insert.** The minimum number of integers to insert is the number of subsegments with sum 0. To calculate this number, the program must iterate over all possible subsegments of the array and check if their sum is 0. This can be a computationally expensive operation, so it is important to optimize the algorithm as much as possible.
4. **Incorrect handling of negative integers.** The problem statement specifies that the array can contain both positive and negative integers. If the program does not handle negative integers correctly, the output may be incorrect.
5. **Incorrect handling of large integers.** The problem statement specifies that the integers in the array can be very large. If the program does not handle large integers correctly, the output may be incorrect.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to design an efficient algorithm for calculating the minimum number of integers to insert. Finally, it is important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it produces the correct output for all possible inputs.

CODEFORCES 144_C. Anagram Search

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of a counter variable.** The most common mistake is to use a counter variable incorrectly. For example, you might accidentally increment the counter variable before using it, or you might forget to increment it at all. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are another common mistake. These occur when you forget to add or subtract one from a variable. For example, you might accidentally count the first element of an array as the second element, or you might forget to include the last element of an array in your calculation. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect use of a loop.** Another common mistake is to use a loop incorrectly. For example, you might forget to initialize the loop variable, or you might use the wrong condition in the loop body. This can lead to incorrect results or infinite loops.
4. **Incorrect use of a function.** Finally, you might also make a mistake when using a function. For example, you might accidentally pass the wrong arguments to the function, or you might forget to call the function. This can lead to incorrect results.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand what you are being asked to do. You should also carefully write out your code and test it thoroughly before submitting it.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1473_C. No More Inversions

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

When working with arrays, it is important to use the correct data type. For example, if you are working with integers, you should use the `int` data type, not the `string` data type. This is because the `string` data type is not able to store integers efficiently, and can lead to errors.

**2. Not initializing your variables**

When you declare a variable, it is important to initialize it with a value. This is because if you do not initialize a variable, it will be assigned a default value, which may not be what you intended. For example, if you declare a variable of type `int` without initializing it, it will be assigned the value `0`.

**3. Using the wrong comparison operator**

When comparing two values, it is important to use the correct comparison operator. For example, you should use the `<` operator to compare two integers, not the `==` operator. This is because the `==` operator checks for equality, not for less than.

**4. Not handling errors correctly**

When working with code, it is important to handle errors correctly. This means that you should check for errors and take appropriate action if an error occurs. For example, if you are reading data from a file, you should check for errors such as file not found or read errors.

**5. Not using a unit test framework**

When writing code, it is important to test your code regularly. This can be done using a unit test framework. A unit test framework allows you to write tests that check your code for errors. This can help you to catch errors early, before they cause problems in production.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1499_E. Chaotic Merge

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the merging function.**

The merging function should take into account the fact that the two strings may have different lengths. For example, if `x = "abc"` and `y = "def"`, then the merging function should return `"abcdef"`, not `"abcde"`.

**2. Using an incorrect modulo operation.**

The modulo operation is used to ensure that the output of the program is a whole number. However, if the modulo operation is not performed correctly, the output may be incorrect. For example, if `x = "1000"` and `y = "1000"`, then the correct answer is `24`, but if the modulo operation is not performed correctly, the answer may be `25`.

**3. Using an incorrect data type.**

The data type used to store the input strings must be large enough to hold the entire string. For example, if the input strings are very long, then the data type `int` may not be large enough.

**4. Using an incorrect algorithm.**

The algorithm used to solve the problem must be correct. For example, if the algorithm does not take into account the fact that the two strings may have different lengths, then the output of the program will be incorrect.

**5. Not handling corner cases correctly.**

The program must handle corner cases correctly. For example, if one of the input strings is empty, then the program must return `0`.

**6. Using incorrect variable names.**

The variable names used in the program must be clear and concise. For example, the variable `n` should be used to store the length of the first string, and the variable `m` should be used to store the length of the second string.

**7. Using incorrect comments.**

The comments in the program should be clear and concise. For example, the comment `// This function merges two strings` should be used to explain the purpose of the `merge` function.

Pain points:
1. **Invalid input format.** The input format for this problem is specific, and it is important to make sure that your code correctly parses the input. Some common errors include:
    * Not using the correct delimiters (e.g., using spaces instead of commas to separate numbers)
    * Not using the correct quotation marks (e.g., using single quotes instead of double quotes)
    * Not using the correct capitalization (e.g., using "n" instead of "N")
    * Not using the correct case (e.g., using "1" instead of "1")
2. **Incorrect use of the `scanf` or `cin` function.** These functions are used to read input from the console, but they can be tricky to use correctly. Some common errors include:
    * Forgetting to specify the correct format specifier (e.g., using "%d" to read a string instead of a number)
    * Using the wrong data type (e.g., using `int` to read a string)
    * Not providing enough space for the input (e.g., trying to read a 10-digit number into a 5-digit array)
3. **Incorrect use of the `printf` or `cout` function.** These functions are used to print output to the console, but they can be tricky to use correctly. Some common errors include:
    * Forgetting to specify the correct format specifier (e.g., using "%d" to print a string instead of a number)
    * Using the wrong data type (e.g., using `int` to print a string)
    * Not providing enough space for the output (e.g., trying to print a 10-digit number into a 5-digit array)
4. **Incorrect use of the `fflush` or `flush` function.** These functions are used to flush the output buffer, but they can be tricky to use correctly. Some common errors include:
    * Forgetting to call the function after printing output
    * Calling the function too often
    * Not calling the function at all
5. **Incorrect use of the `exit` function.** This function is used to terminate the program, but it can be tricky to use correctly. Some common errors include:
    * Calling the function without an argument
    * Calling the function from inside a loop
    * Calling the function from inside a function that is called from another function
6. **Incorrect use of the `malloc` or `calloc` function.** These functions are used to allocate memory, but they can be tricky to use correctly. Some common errors include:
    * Forgetting to free the memory after you are done with it
    * Using the wrong size for the memory allocation
    * Not initializing the memory correctly
7. **Incorrect use of the `assert` macro.** This macro is used to check for errors, but it can be tricky to use correctly. Some common errors include:
    * Using the macro in a non-debug build
    * Using the macro with an invalid expression
    * Not providing a message for the assertion
8. **Incorrect use of the `static` keyword.** This keyword is used to declare variables that are local to a function or a block of code, but it can be tricky to use correctly. Some common errors include:
    * Declaring a variable as `static` when it does not need to be
    * Declaring a variable as `static` inside a loop
    * Declaring a variable as `static` and then not using it

Title:
CODEFORCES 1550_C. Manhattan Subarrays

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the Manhattan distance formula.** The Manhattan distance between two points is defined as the sum of the absolute values of their differences in each dimension. For example, the Manhattan distance between the points (1, 2) and (3, 4) is |1 - 3| + |2 - 4| = 6. A common mistake is to use the Euclidean distance formula instead, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in each dimension. For example, the Euclidean distance between the points (1, 2) and (3, 4) is sqrt(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2) = √29 ≈ 5.48. This error can lead to incorrect results when computing the number of good subarrays.
2. **Incorrect handling of degenerate cases.** The problem statement specifies that subarrays of length 1 and 2 are good. A common mistake is to forget to check for these cases. For example, the following code would incorrectly count the number of good subarrays in the input [1, 2, 3]:

```
def count_good_subarrays(a):
  n = len(a)
  count = 0
  for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
      if d(a[i], i) + d(a[j], j) < d(a[i], j):
        count += 1
  return count

print(count_good_subarrays([1, 2, 3]))
```

The correct answer is 3, but this code would return 2.
3. **Incorrect use of dynamic programming.** The problem can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming. A common mistake is to use the wrong recurrence relation. For example, the following code would incorrectly count the number of good subarrays in the input [1, 2, 3]:

```
def count_good_subarrays(a):
  n = len(a)
  dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
  for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
      if d(a[i], i) + d(a[j], j) < d(a[i], j):
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
  return dp[n - 1][n - 1]

print(count_good_subarrays([1, 2, 3]))
```

The correct answer is 3, but this code would return 1.

The correct recurrence relation is as follows:

```
dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1 if d(a[i], i) + d(a[j], j) < d(a[i], j) else dp[i - 1][j - 1]
```

This recurrence relation correctly counts the number of good subarrays that end at index j.
4. **Incorrect use of memoization.** The problem can also be solved using memoization. A common mistake is to use the wrong memoization table. For example, the following code would incorrectly count the number of good subarrays in the input [1, 2, 3]:

```
def count_good_subarrays(a):
  n = len(a)
  memo = [[-1] * n for _ in range(n)]
  def dp(i, j):
    if i >= j:
      return 0
    if memo[i][j] != -1:
      return memo[i][j]
    if d(a[i], i) + d(a[j], j) < d(a[i], j):
      memo[i][j] = dp(i - 1, j - 1) + 1
    else:
      memo[i][j] = dp(i - 1, j - 1)
    return memo[i][j]
  return dp(n - 1, n - 1)

print(count_good_subarrays([1, 2, 3]))
```

The correct memoization table should be a

CODEFORCES 177_A1. Good Matrix Elements

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line of input data should contain a single odd integer n. However, a developer may accidentally enter an even number or a non-integer value. This will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the program should print a single integer, the sum of the good matrix elements. However, a developer may accidentally print multiple integers, or a non-integer value. This will cause the program to produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the sum of good matrix elements.** The sum of good matrix elements can be calculated by summing the elements of the main diagonal, the secondary diagonal, the "middle" row, and the "middle" column. However, a developer may accidentally omit one or more of these diagonals or rows/columns from the calculation. This will cause the program to produce incorrect output.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the indices of the main diagonal, the secondary diagonal, the "middle" row, and the "middle" column, a developer may accidentally miscalculate the indices by one. This will cause the program to incorrectly identify some of the good matrix elements, and thus produce incorrect output.
5. **Memory errors.** If the matrix is large, the program may run out of memory while trying to allocate space for the matrix elements. This will cause the program to crash.
6. **Timeout errors.** If the program takes too long to run, the judge may time it out and give it a zero score. This can happen if the program is inefficiently written or if the matrix is very large.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully check their code for errors before submitting it to a competition. They should also make sure that their code is well-commented and easy to understand.

Title:
CODEFORCES 197_C. Lexicographically Maximum Subsequence

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly comparing strings.** The most common mistake is to compare strings lexicographically using the `>` operator. This will not work because the `>` operator compares the values of the strings, not their lexicographical order. To compare strings lexicographically, you need to use the `<=` operator.
2. **Using the wrong data structure.** The problem asks for the lexicographically maximum subsequence of a string. A subsequence is a contiguous substring of the original string. To find the lexicographically maximum subsequence, you need to use a data structure that can efficiently store and compare contiguous substrings of the original string. A simple array will not work because it cannot efficiently compare substrings. You need to use a data structure such as a suffix array or a longest common substring array.
3. **Not handling special cases.** The problem statement does not mention any special cases. However, there are a few special cases that you need to handle in order to get the correct answer. For example, if the input string is empty, the output should be the empty string.
4. **Misunderstanding the problem statement.** The problem statement is very clear, but it is easy to make a mistake if you do not read it carefully. Make sure you understand the problem statement before you start working on the solution.
5. **Not using a test suite.** It is always a good idea to use a test suite to verify your solution. This will help you catch any bugs that you may have missed.

s = "ababba"

Title:
CODEFORCES 220_D. Little Elephant and Triangle

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the input should be two integers separated by a space. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to parse the input and will produce an error.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the output should be a single integer. If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will produce an error.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of triangles.** The number of triangles can be calculated by counting the number of ways to choose three points from the set of all integer points. However, this calculation can be incorrect if the set of all integer points is not correctly defined. For example, if the set of all integer points is defined as the set of all points with integer coordinates, then the number of triangles will be incorrect because some points will not be included in the set.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the remainder.** The remainder of dividing the number of triangles by 1000000007 can be calculated by using the following formula:

```
remainder = (number of triangles) % 1000000007
```

However, this calculation can be incorrect if the number of triangles is large. In this case, the remainder can be calculated by using the following formula:

```
remainder = (number of triangles) - (number of triangles / 1000000007) * 1000000007
```

5. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of dividing the first operand by the second operand. However, the modulo operator can be used incorrectly if the second operand is zero. In this case, the modulo operator will return an incorrect value.

6. **Incorrect use of the factorial function.** The factorial function (n!) returns the product of all the integers from 1 to n. However, the factorial function can be used incorrectly if n is negative. In this case, the factorial function will return an incorrect value.
Test inputs:
1. Incorrect input format:

h = int(input())
print(w * h * (w + 1) * (h + 1) // 2)
```

4. Incorrect calculation of the remainder:
```
w = int(input())
h = int(input())
print((w * h * (w + 1) * (h + 1) // 2) % 1000000007)
```

5. Incorrect use of the modulo operator:
```
w = int(input())
h = int(input())
print(w * h * (w + 1) * (h + 1) % 0)

CODEFORCES 244_E. Colorado Potato Beetle

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Off-by-one errors.** Be careful when calculating the indices of the beds that Old MacDonald sprays, as well as the indices of the beds that are infected by the Colorado potato beetle.
2. **Incorrect use of 64-bit integers.** In C++, it is preferred to use the `cin`, `cout` streams or the `%I64d` specifier when reading or writing 64-bit integers. Using the `%lld` specifier can lead to errors.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** Make sure to handle the cases where Old MacDonald's movements go off the edge of the field.
4. **Incorrect logic.** Be careful when reasoning about the invasion of the Colorado potato beetle. Make sure to consider all of the possible ways that a bed can become infected.
5. **Unclear code.** Make sure your code is clear and easy to understand. Use comments to explain your thought process and to document your code.

Here are some specific examples of problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Off-by-one error:** A developer might incorrectly calculate the indices of the beds that Old MacDonald sprays, resulting in some beds being sprayed that should not be sprayed, or some beds not being sprayed that should be sprayed.
* **Incorrect use of 64-bit integers:** A developer might use the `%lld` specifier to read or write 64-bit integers, which can lead to errors.
* **Incorrect handling of edge cases:** A developer might not handle the cases where Old MacDonald's movements go off the edge of the field, resulting in some beds being sprayed that should not be sprayed, or some beds not being sprayed that should be sprayed.
* **Incorrect logic:** A developer might incorrectly reason about the invasion of the Colorado potato beetle, resulting in some beds being infected that should not be infected, or some beds not being infected that should be infected.
* **Unclear code:** A developer might write code that is unclear and difficult to understand, making it difficult for other developers to read and maintain the code.

By avoiding these problems and bugs, you can write code that is correct, efficient, and easy to understand.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that the input is in the correct format, or the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also very specific. It is important to make sure that the output is in the correct format, or the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the number of planks needed**

The number of planks needed to parquet the living room can be calculated by multiplying the number of rows by the number of columns. However, it is important to make sure that the number of planks is not negative, or the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

**4. Incorrect calculation of the number of planks used**

The number of planks used to parquet the living room can be calculated by adding up the number of each type of plank. However, it is important to make sure that the number of planks used does not exceed the number of planks available, or the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

**5. Incorrect identification of the type of plank**

The type of plank can be identified by its dimensions. For example, a plank that is 1 × 2 meters is a type 1 plank, and a plank that is 2 × 1 meters is a type 2 plank. However, it is important to make sure that the type of plank is correctly identified, or the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

**6. Incorrect placement of the planks**

The planks must be placed in such a way that they cover the entire living room. However, it is important to make sure that the planks are not overlapping, or the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

CODEFORCES 292_E. Copying Data

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one errors.** When copying or slicing arrays, it is important to make sure that you are not copying or slicing one element past the end of the array. This can be done by using the `len()` function to get the length of the array, and then making sure that your slice or copy does not go beyond that index.
2. **Indexing errors.** When accessing elements of an array, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct index. This can be done by using the `i` or `j` variable to iterate over the array, and then using the `array[i]` syntax to access the element at that index.
3. **Memory errors.** When copying or slicing arrays, it is important to make sure that you are not creating too many new arrays. This can be done by using the `copy()` function to create a shallow copy of an array, or by using the `slice()` function to create a view of an array.
4. **Type errors.** When copying or slicing arrays, it is important to make sure that the source and destination arrays are of the same type. This can be done by using the `type()` function to check the type of an array.
5. **Invalid input.** When reading input from the user, it is important to make sure that the input is valid. This can be done by using the `isdigit()` function to check if a string is a number, or by using the `int()` function to convert a string to a number.

CODEFORCES 435_C. Cardiogram

Pain points:
### Possible problems and bugs

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is `n a1 a2 ... an` where `n` is the number of points in the cardiogram and `a1, a2, ..., an` are the y-coordinates of the points. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to parse the input and will produce an error.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format for this problem is a series of lines, each of which contains `max(|yi - yj|)` characters. Each character must be either `/`, `\`, or ` ` (space). If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be accepted by the checker.
3. **Incorrect calculation of `max(|yi - yj|)`**. The maximum difference between two y-coordinates in a cardiogram is the difference between the highest and lowest y-coordinates. If the program incorrectly calculates this value, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect printing of the cardiogram**. The cardiogram must be printed using the characters `/`, `\`, and ` ` (space). If the program incorrectly prints the cardiogram, the output will be incorrect.
5. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. The cardiogram problem has several edge cases, such as a cardiogram with only one point or a cardiogram with two points with the same y-coordinate. The program must be able to handle these edge cases correctly or the output will be incorrect.

### How to avoid these problems

1. Carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand the input and output formats.
2. Test your program on a variety of input data to make sure it is handling all of the edge cases correctly.
3. Use a debugger to help you track down any errors in your program.

Pain points:
1. **Inconsistent data**. The input data may be inconsistent. For example, the input may contain two links between the same two nodes with different weights or bandwidths.
2. **Unconnected graph**. The input graph may not be connected. This means that there may not be a path from node 1 to node n.
3. **Negative bandwidth**. The bandwidth on a link cannot be negative.
4. **Infeasible solution**. The intern's solution may not be feasible. This means that it may not be possible to send k units of bandwidth from node 1 to node n using the given links and bandwidths.
5. **Optimality**. The intern's solution may not be optimal. This means that there may exist a different solution with a lower cost.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input data and make sure that it is consistent and complete. The developer should also make sure that the intern's solution is feasible and optimal. If any of these problems are present, the developer should report them to the intern.

Title:
CODEFORCES 553_D. Nudist Beach

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** This is the most common problem that developers encounter when solving a problem. It can happen for a variety of reasons, such as a misunderstanding of the algorithm, a mistake in the implementation, or a bug in the code.
2. **Incorrect input data.** Another common problem is incorrect input data. This can happen if the data is not formatted correctly, if the data is missing, or if the data is corrupted.
3. **Incorrect output.** The output of the program should be correct. If the output is incorrect, it could be due to a bug in the code, or it could be due to a misunderstanding of the problem.
4. **Time complexity.** The time complexity of the algorithm should be taken into account when solving a problem. If the algorithm is too slow, it may not be able to solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time.
5. **Space complexity.** The space complexity of the algorithm should also be taken into account. If the algorithm uses too much memory, it may not be able to solve the problem on a computer with limited resources.
6. **Memory leaks.** Memory leaks can occur when a program does not properly free memory that it has allocated. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
7. **Synchronization issues.** Synchronization issues can occur when multiple threads or processes are trying to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
8. **Race conditions.** Race conditions can occur when two or more threads or processes are trying to access the same data at the same time and the outcome depends on the order in which the threads or processes are executed. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
9. **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads or processes are waiting for each other to release a resource that they both need. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely.
10. **Unhandled exceptions.** Unhandled exceptions can occur when a program encounters an error that it cannot handle. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

CODEFORCES 57_C. Array

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be a single line containing an integer n. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect modulo operation**. The modulo operation should be performed using the `%` operator. If the modulo operation is performed incorrectly, the program will return an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of beautiful arrays**. The number of beautiful arrays can be calculated using the following formula:

```
N = (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 2
```

If the number of beautiful arrays is calculated incorrectly, the program will return an incorrect answer.

CODEFORCES 601_B. Lipshitz Sequence

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Lipschitz constant formula.** The formula for the Lipschitz constant is `L = max(abs(h[i] - h[j]) / (i - j))` for all `1 <= i < j <= n`. Some implementations incorrectly use `i` and `j` in the denominator, which will lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect handling of queries with `l = r`.** The Lipschitz constant of a subarray with length 1 is always 0. Some implementations incorrectly return a non-zero value for these queries.
3. **Incorrect handling of queries with `l > r`.** These queries are invalid and should be ignored. Some implementations incorrectly return a value for these queries.
4. **Incorrect handling of empty subarrays.** The Lipschitz constant of an empty subarray is undefined. Some implementations incorrectly return a value for these subarrays.
5. **Incorrect handling of out-of-bounds queries.** These queries are invalid and should be ignored. Some implementations incorrectly return a value for these queries.

By following these tips, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving the Lipschitz Sequence problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 623_E. Transforming Sequence

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the bitwise OR operation.** The bitwise OR operation is performed by taking the binary representation of each of the operands, and then ORing each bit of the first operand with the corresponding bit of the second operand. This can be done using the bitwise OR operator (|), or by using the bitwise shift operators (<< and >>). For example, the bitwise OR of the numbers 0b1010 and 0b0101 is 0b1111.

**2. Incorrect handling of overflow.** When performing bitwise operations on large numbers, it is important to be aware of the possibility of overflow. Overflow occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be represented in the specified data type. In C++, this can be avoided by using the unsigned integer types, which do not have a maximum value. For example, the following code will not overflow:

```c++
unsigned int a = 0xffffffff;
unsigned int b = 0xffffffff;
unsigned int c = a | b;
```

**3. Incorrect handling of negative numbers.** The bitwise OR operation does not work on negative numbers. When a negative number is converted to binary, the most significant bit is set to 1. This means that the bitwise OR of a negative number and a positive number will always be the positive number. For example, the bitwise OR of the numbers -1 and 1 is 1.

**4. Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic.** Modulo arithmetic is used to perform arithmetic operations on numbers that are greater than or equal to the modulus. The result of a modulo arithmetic operation is always a number that is less than or equal to the modulus. For example, the modulo of 1000000007 divided by 10 is 7.

**5. Incorrect use of the factorial function.** The factorial function is defined as the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to a given number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 120. The factorial function can be computed using the following recursive formula:

```
n! = n * (n - 1)!
```

**6. Incorrect use of the binomial coefficient.** The binomial coefficient is defined as the number of ways of choosing k objects from a set of n objects. The binomial coefficient can be computed using the following formula:

```
C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)
```

**7. Incorrect use of the Catalan number.** The Catalan number is defined as the number of ways of drawing n non-crossing diagonals in a square. The Catalan number can be computed using the following formula:

```
C(n) = (2n)! / (n! * (n + 1)!)

Title:
CODEFORCES 697_D. Puzzles

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input contains a tree with n nodes. The output should contain n expected values. So the data type of the input and output should be `int` or `long long`.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The expected value of the starting time of a node is the sum of the expected values of its children plus 1. So the algorithm should be:

```
def dfs(node):
    global current_time
    current_time += 1
    starting_time[node] = current_time
    for child in children[node]:
        dfs(child)
```

**3. Not handling corner cases**

The input may contain a tree with one node or a tree with a cycle. In these cases, the expected value of the starting time of every node is 1. The algorithm should handle these cases correctly.

**4. Not using the right data structures**

The input contains a tree with n nodes. So the data structure to store the tree should be a `vector` of `vector` of `int`.

CODEFORCES 718_C. Sasha and Array

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the input parser will not be able to correctly parse the input.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format for this problem is also very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if you forget to add a newline character at the end of the output, the judge will not be able to correctly evaluate your solution.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** This problem involves a lot of arithmetic operations, and it's easy to make a mistake and get an off-by-one error. For example, if you forget to add 1 to the index of an array when iterating over it, you'll end up with an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic.** This problem requires you to use modulo arithmetic to correctly calculate the Fibonacci numbers. If you don't use modulo arithmetic correctly, you'll end up with an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect use of the Fibonacci recurrence relation.** The Fibonacci recurrence relation is a very important part of this problem, and it's easy to make a mistake when using it. For example, if you forget to carry over the carry when calculating the next Fibonacci number, you'll end up with an incorrect answer.
6. **Incorrect use of the array data structure.** This problem requires you to use an array to store the Fibonacci numbers. If you don't use the array correctly, you'll end up with an incorrect answer.
7. **Incorrect use of the dynamic programming technique.** This problem can be solved using dynamic programming, and it's easy to make a mistake when using this technique. For example, if you forget to update the values of the Fibonacci numbers in the table when you're making a recursive call, you'll end up with an incorrect answer.
8. **Incorrect use of the memoization technique.** This problem can also be solved using memoization, and it's easy to make a mistake when using this technique. For example, if you forget to check if the value of the Fibonacci number is already in the memoization table before calculating it, you'll end up with an incorrect answer.
9. **Incorrect use of the binary search technique.** This problem can be solved using binary search, and it's easy to make a mistake when using this technique. For example, if you don't check if the middle element of the search space is the answer before continuing the search, you'll end up with an incorrect answer.
10. **Incorrect use of the divide and conquer technique.** This problem can be solved using the divide and conquer technique, and it's easy to make a mistake when using this technique. For example, if you don't divide the problem into subproblems of equal size before solving them recursively, you'll end up with an incorrect answer.

CODEFORCES 762_F. Tree nesting

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not strictly defined. For example, the input may contain multiple spaces between two integers, or the integers may not be separated by spaces at all. This can lead to the program reading the input incorrectly and producing incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The problem states that the number of vertices of tree S and tree T must be between 1 and 1000, inclusive. However, the input may contain values that are outside of this range. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect edge definition**

The problem states that the edges of tree S and tree T must be defined as two integers separated by a space. However, the input may contain edges that are defined in a different way, such as two integers separated by a comma or two integers without any delimiter. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect isomorphism definition**

The problem states that two trees are isomorphic if there exists a bijection between the vertices of the two trees such that if there is an edge between two vertices in one tree, then there must be an edge between the corresponding vertices in the other tree. However, the input may contain trees that are not isomorphic, even if they satisfy the definition of isomorphism given in the problem statement. This can lead to the program incorrectly counting the number of subtrees of tree S that are isomorphic to tree T.

**5. Incorrect output format**

The problem states that the output must be a single integer, modulo 109 + 7. However, the program may output a non-integer value, or a value that is not modulo 109 + 7. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

**6. Memory errors**

The problem may require a large amount of memory to store the data structures used to solve it. If the program does not allocate enough memory, it may crash or produce incorrect results.

**7. Time complexity**

The problem may require a large amount of time to solve. If the program does not take into account the time complexity of its algorithms, it may take too long to run and produce incorrect results.

To avoid this problem, make sure that the output is formatted correctly.

### 3. Incorrect data types

The problem does not specify the data types of the input and output values. This can lead to errors if the program does not correctly convert the input values to the correct data types.

For example, the following code would incorrectly convert the input values to integers:

```
n = int(input())
```

The input value `1 2 3` would be converted to the integer `1`, which is not the correct value.

To avoid this problem, make sure that the program correctly converts the input values to the correct data types.

### 4. Off-by-one errors

The problem states that there is exactly one path between every pair of houses. This means that the path from house `a` to house `b` must contain exactly `b - a` houses. However, it is possible to make a mistake and count the number of houses in the path incorrectly.

For example, the following code would incorrectly count the number of houses in the path from house `1` to house `3`:

```
num_houses = 3 - 1
```

The correct number of houses in the path is `2`, not `3`.

To avoid this problem, make sure that you correctly count the number of houses in the path.

### 5. Undefined behavior

The problem does not specify what should happen if the input is invalid or if the output is incorrect. This can lead to undefined behavior, which is when the program does something unexpected.

For example, the following code would cause undefined behavior if the input is invalid:

```
n = int(input())
```

If the input is invalid, the program will try to convert the input to an integer, which will cause an error.

To avoid this problem, make sure that you handle invalid input and output correctly.

CODEFORCES 877_D. Olya and Energy Drinks

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not always correctly parsed, which can lead to errors in the solution. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program will crash.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not always correctly specified, which can lead to errors in the solution. For example, if the output is not a single integer, the program will crash.
* **Incorrect calculation of distances:** The distance between two points is not always calculated correctly, which can lead to errors in the solution. For example, if the points are on different sides of a wall, the distance between them will be incorrect.
* **Incorrect path finding:** The path from one point to another is not always found correctly, which can lead to errors in the solution. For example, if the path goes through a wall, the program will crash.
* **Incorrect time calculation:** The time it takes to travel from one point to another is not always calculated correctly, which can lead to errors in the solution. For example, if the speed is not constant, the time will be incorrect.

**Some tips for avoiding these problems:**

* Carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand the input and output formats.
* Use a unit test framework to test your code. This will help you catch errors in your code early on.
* Use a debugger to step through your code and watch how it works. This will help you identify any problems in your logic.
* Ask for help from others if you are stuck. There are many online resources available to help you solve problems.

CODEFORCES 900_E. Maximum Questions

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specified in the problem statement is not followed, which can lead to errors in the solution. For example, if the input string contains characters other than 'a', 'b', and '?', the solution will not work correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specified in the problem statement is not followed, which can lead to errors in the solution. For example, if the output is not a single integer, the solution will not work correctly.
3. **Incorrect algorithm.** The solution may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, a solution that simply counts the number of occurrences of the substring `"abab..."` in the string `s` will not work correctly if there are multiple occurrences of the substring that overlap.
4. **Incorrect data structures.** The solution may use incorrect data structures to store the input data, which can lead to errors in the solution. For example, a solution that uses a hash table to store the occurrences of the substring `"abab..."` in the string `s` will not work correctly if the string `s` contains multiple occurrences of the substring that overlap.
5. **Incorrect implementation.** The solution may be incorrectly implemented, which can lead to errors in the solution. For example, a solution that uses a for loop to iterate over the string `s` may not correctly handle the case where the string `s` is empty.
6. **Runtime errors.** The solution may run into runtime errors, such as running out of memory or causing a segmentation fault. For example, a solution that uses a recursive algorithm to find the occurrences of the substring `"abab..."` in the string `s` may run into a stack overflow error if the string `s` is long enough.
7. **Incorrect time complexity.** The solution may have an incorrect time complexity, which can lead to the solution being too slow to run on large inputs. For example, a solution that uses a brute-force algorithm to find the occurrences of the substring `"abab..."` in the string `s` will have a time complexity of O(n^2), which is too slow for large inputs.
8. **Incorrect space complexity.** The solution may have an incorrect space complexity, which can lead to the solution using too much memory. For example, a solution that uses a hash table to store the occurrences of the substring `"abab..."` in the string `s` will have a space complexity of O(n), which is too much memory for large inputs.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The problem statement mentions that the number of paint boxes is N, but the code below uses `n` as the variable name. This could lead to errors if the value of N is not a valid integer.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator.** The problem statement says that Ferb cannot paint two consecutive fence woods with the same color, but the code below uses the `==` operator to compare the colors of two fence woods. This could lead to errors if the colors of the two fence woods are not equal.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The code below checks if the colors of two consecutive fence woods are equal, and if they are, it prints `"bad luck"`. However, the problem statement says that Ferb can paint two consecutive fence woods with the same color if he has enough paint boxes. This means that the code should check if the number of paint boxes is greater than or equal to the number of fence woods, and if it is, it should print `"can do"`.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The problem statement says that the output should be `"can do"` or `"bad luck"`, but the code below prints `"can do"` if the number of paint boxes is greater than or equal to the number of fence woods, and it prints `"bad luck"` if the number of paint boxes is less than the number of fence woods.

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input format is not specified clearly. For example, is the input a list of integers or a list of strings?
* The output format is not specified clearly. For example, should the output be a list of integers or a list of strings?
* The problem statement does not specify what the function `ZeroShark` should do. For example, should the function return a boolean value or an integer value?
* The problem statement does not specify what the function `binTrues` should do. For example, should the function return a list of strings or a list of integers?
* The problem statement does not specify what the constraints are. For example, what is the maximum value of `N`?
* The problem statement does not specify what the modulo operation is. For example, is the modulo operation performed on integers or strings?

**Here are some possible solutions to these problems:**

* The input format can be specified as follows:

  for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if x[i] == '0' and x[i - 1] == '0':
      counter += 1
  return counter == 1
```

* The function `binTrues` can be defined as follows:

```
def binTrues(N):
  """
  Returns a list of all binary strings of length `N` that contain exactly one
  pair of consecutive 0s.
  """

  results = []
  for i in range(2 ** N):

Title:
ATCODER p02664 NOMURA Programming Competition 2020 - Postdocs

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type:** The input string `T` can have a length of up to `2 * 10^5`, so it's important to use a data type that can store such a large number of characters. Using a smaller data type, such as `int`, could result in an overflow error.
2. **Incorrectly handling the `?` character:** The `?` character can represent either a `P` or a `D`. It's important to make sure that you handle this character correctly, otherwise you may get an incorrect answer.
3. **Not considering all possible cases:** The problem statement states that there may be multiple strings that have the maximum possible doctoral and postdoctoral quotient. It's important to make sure that you consider all of these cases, otherwise you may not find the optimal solution.
4. **Using inefficient algorithms:** There are a number of different ways to solve this problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. It's important to choose an algorithm that is efficient enough to solve the problem within the given time constraints.
5. **Making a programming error:** Even the most experienced programmers can make mistakes. It's important to carefully check your code for errors before submitting it. Some common programming errors include typos, logic errors, and off-by-one errors.

Title:
ATCODER p02929 Japanese Student Championship 2019 Qualification - Cell Inversion

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modular arithmetic.** When computing the final answer, be sure to use the modulo operator (`%`) to ensure that the answer is within the range `[0, 10^9+7]`.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** Be careful when counting the number of squares or operations. For example, if you are asked to count the number of squares between two given squares, make sure to include the two given squares in your count.
3. **Incorrect use of data structures.** Make sure that you are using the correct data structures to store your data. For example, if you are asked to store a list of numbers, use a list data structure rather than a string or a tuple.
4. **Incorrect algorithm.** Make sure that your algorithm is correct. For example, if you are asked to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, make sure that your algorithm actually finds the shortest path.
5. **Runtime errors.** Make sure that your code runs in a reasonable amount of time. For example, if you are asked to solve a problem in O(n^2) time, make sure that your code does not run in O(n^3) time.
6. **Memory errors.** Make sure that your code does not use too much memory. For example, if you are asked to solve a problem with a large input, make sure that your code does not use more memory than is necessary.

Title:
ATCODER p03357 AtCoder Regular Contest 097 - Sorted and Sorted

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a color ('W' or 'B') and an integer. If you try to iterate over this list using a for loop, you will get a TypeError because the tuples are not iterable. To fix this, you can convert the list of tuples to a list of lists, or you can use a list comprehension to iterate over the tuples.

**2. Using the wrong index**

The problem states that the balls are arranged in a row, so the first ball is at index 1, the second ball is at index 2, and so on. However, if you try to access the balls using their index, you will get an IndexError because the index starts at 0. To fix this, you can add 1 to the index when you access the balls.

**3. Not considering the order of the balls**

The problem states that the balls need to be sorted in both the white and black lists. However, if you just sort the lists, you will not necessarily get the correct answer. You need to make sure that the balls are sorted in the same order in both lists.

**4. Forgetting to account for duplicates**

The problem states that the integers from 1 to N are written on the white balls, and they are also written on the black balls. However, it is possible that there are duplicates in the list of integers. If you forget to account for duplicates, you will get an incorrect answer.

**5. Misunderstanding the problem**

The problem is asking you to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve the objective. However, if you try to brute force the problem, you will get an incorrect answer. You need to use a more efficient algorithm to find the minimum number of operations.

**6. Using a slow algorithm**

The problem can be solved in O(N) time, but if you use a slow algorithm, you will get an incorrect answer. You need to use a fast algorithm to solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time.

Title:
ATCODER p03515 CODE FESTIVAL 2017 Elimination Tournament Round 3 (Parallel) - Black Cats Deployment

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The most important problem that a developer may encounter when solving this problem is an incorrect implementation of the algorithm. This could lead to incorrect results or even a runtime error.

To avoid this problem, it is important to carefully read and understand the algorithm before implementing it. It is also helpful to test the algorithm on small input sets to ensure that it is working correctly.

**2. Using incorrect data types**

Another common problem that developers encounter is using incorrect data types. For example, if the input values are integers, but the developer uses floating-point numbers, this could lead to incorrect results.

To avoid this problem, it is important to use the correct data types for the input values. This can be done by checking the data type of the input values and using the appropriate data type in the algorithm.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common problem that can occur when iterating over a list or array. This can lead to incorrect results or even a runtime error.

To avoid this problem, it is important to carefully check the indices of the elements in the list or array. It is also helpful to use a debugger to help identify off-by-one errors.

**4. Using uninitialized variables**

Using uninitialized variables is a common problem that can lead to incorrect results or even a runtime error. This is because uninitialized variables can contain any value, which could lead to unexpected results.

To avoid this problem, it is important to initialize all variables before using them. This can be done by assigning them a value or by using the `memset()` function.

**5. Forgetting to free memory**

Forgetting to free memory is a common problem that can lead to a memory leak. This is because the memory that was allocated for the variable will not be released, which can eventually lead to the program running out of memory.

To avoid this problem, it is important to free all memory that was allocated using the `free()` function.

Title:
ATCODER p03833 AtCoder Regular Contest 067 - Yakiniku Restaurants

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the number of restaurants is not an integer, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values may not be correct, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the distance between two restaurants is a string instead of an integer, the program will not be able to calculate the distance correctly.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The program may calculate the distance between two restaurants incorrectly, which may result in an incorrect answer. For example, if the distance between two restaurants is 100, the program may calculate the distance as 99 or 101.
4. **Arithmetic error**. The program may make an arithmetic error when calculating the total distance traveled or the total deliciousness of the meals eaten. For example, if the total distance traveled is 100 and the total deliciousness of the meals eaten is 101, the program may incorrectly calculate the happiness as 1 instead of 11.
5. **Logic error**. The program may have a logic error, which may result in an incorrect answer. For example, the program may not consider all possible combinations of restaurants and tickets, or it may not correctly calculate the maximum possible happiness.

Title:
ATCODER p03998 AtCoder Beginner Contest 045 - Card Game for Three (ABC Edit)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of cards in each player's deck.** This is a common mistake that can be made when iterating over the strings S_A, S_B, and S_C. It is important to remember that each character in these strings represents one card, so the number of cards in each deck is equal to the length of the string.
2. **Not handling the case where one of the players' decks is empty.** This can happen if the player draws the last card from their deck. In this case, the game ends and the player who drew the last card wins.
3. **Not handling the case where two or more players have the same number of cards.** In this case, the game ends in a tie.
4. **Incorrectly determining the winner of the game.** The winner of the game is the player who has the most cards left in their deck when the game ends.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use a counter to keep track of the number of cards in each player's deck.
* Check for the case where one of the players' decks is empty before continuing with the game.
* Use a tie-breaking rule to determine the winner of the game in the case where two or more players have the same number of cards.
* Carefully verify your solution by testing it on a variety of input examples.

Possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correct. For example, the number of rooms, the number of passageways, the number of balls, or the order of the shortest route may be incorrect.
* **Incorrect data:** The data given in the input may be incorrect. For example, the distance between two rooms may be negative or there may be a passage between two rooms that do not exist.
* **Incorrect algorithm:** The algorithm used to find the shortest route may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not find the shortest route or it may find a route that is not the shortest.
* **Incorrect output:** The output may be incorrect. For example, the output may not be the time to start casting the spell or it may be a negative number.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input format, the data, the algorithm, and the output. Additionally, the developer should test the code with a variety of input data to ensure that it is correct.

Title:
AIZU p01135 Poor Mail Forwarding

Pain points:
```
1. **Incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of integers and strings. However, the code below treats the input data as a list of strings. This will cause errors when the input data contains integers.

```
def main():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
```

To fix this, we need to change the code to treat the input data as a list of integers. We can do this by using the `map()` function to convert the input data to a list of integers.

```
def main():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
```

2. **Incorrect index**

The code below tries to access the element at index `-1` of the list `routes`. However, the list `routes` has no elements, so this will cause an error.

```
for i in range(m):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    routes.append([a, b, c])

for i in range(l):
    a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
    time_table[a].append([b, c, d])

min_time = 999999999
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(len(time_table[i])):
        if time_table[i][j][0] == d:
            min_time = min(min_time, time_table[i][j][2] + routes[time_table[i][j][1] - 1][2])
print(min_time)
```

To fix this, we need to check if the list `routes` has any elements before trying to access the element at index `-1`. We can do this by using the `len()` function to get the length of the list.

```
for i in range(m):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    routes.append([a, b, c])

for i in range(l):
    a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
    time_table[a].append([b, c, d])

min_time = 999999999
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(len(time_table[i])):
        if time_table[i][j][0] == d:
            min_time = min(min_time, time_table[i][j][2] + routes[time_table[i][j][1] - 1][2])
print(min_time)
```

3. **Incorrect logic**

The code below tries to find the minimum time by comparing the time of each mail item with the minimum time. However, the minimum time is updated after each iteration, so the code will never find the correct minimum time.

```
min_time = 999999999
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(len(time_table[i])):
        if time_table[i][j][0] == d:
            min_time = min(min_time, time_table[i][j][2] + routes[time_table[i][j][1] - 1][2])
print(min_time)
```

To fix this, we need to keep track of the minimum time as we iterate through the list of mail items. We can do this by using a variable to store the minimum time.

```
min_time = 999999999
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(len(time_table[i])):
        if time_table[i][j][0] == d:
            min_time = min(min_time, time_table[i][j][2] + routes[time_table[i][j][1] - 1][2])
print(min_time)
```

4. **Incorrect indentation**

The code below is not correctly indented. This can make it difficult to read and understand.

```

    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    for i in range(m):
        a, b, c = map(int, input

Title:
AIZU p01274 Magic Slayer

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The input format specifies that the number of monsters `N` is an integer, but the code below incorrectly treats it as a string. This will cause the code to crash when the input contains a non-integer value for `N`.
2. **Incorrect variable initialization.** The code below initializes the variable `min_mp` to a value of `0`. This is incorrect because the minimum magic power required to defeat all the monsters may be greater than `0`.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The code below uses a `for` loop to iterate over the list of spells. However, the loop body does not actually do anything to update the value of `min_mp`. This means that the code will always output a value of `0` for the minimum magic power required, regardless of the input.
4. **Incorrect output.** The code below does not output anything to the console. This means that the user will not be able to see the results of the program.

To fix these problems, we can make the following changes to the code:

1. Change the type of the variable `N` to `int`.
2. Initialize the variable `min_mp` to a value of `1000000000`. This is a large number that is greater than the maximum possible magic power required to defeat all the monsters.
3. In the loop body, check if the damage caused by the current spell is greater than the current value of `min_mp`. If it is, update `min_mp` to the value of the damage.
4. Add an `if` statement to check if the input contains a value of `0` for `N`. If it does, then print a message to the console indicating that the program has finished.

With these changes, the code will correctly identify the minimum magic power required to defeat all the monsters in the input.

Title:
AIZU p01750 Hyperrectangle

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input is "2 6 3 4 a", the program will crash because the 4th input is not an integer.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The program may incorrectly calculate the volume of the eaten part, which will result in an incorrect answer. For example, if the input is "2 6 3 4", the program may incorrectly calculate the volume as 6 * 3 = 18, which is incorrect.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The program may incorrectly calculate the factorial of d, which will result in an incorrect answer. For example, if the input is "2 6 3 4", the program may incorrectly calculate the factorial of d as 2! = 2, which is incorrect.
4. **Memory overflow**. The program may not be able to handle large inputs, which will result in a memory overflow error. For example, if the input is "5 12 34 56 78 90 123", the program may not be able to handle the large number of inputs and will crash.
5. **Timeout**. The program may take too long to run, which will result in a timeout error. For example, if the input is "5 12 34 56 78 90 123", the program may take too long to calculate the factorial of d and will timeout.

Title:
AIZU p01890 Non-redundant Drive

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a list of integers, followed by a list of pairs of integers. Each pair of integers represents the start and end points of a road. The start and end points should be integers between 1 and the number of cities.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer, representing the number of non-redundant roads.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the length of a road, it is easy to make a mistake and add 1 or subtract 1 too many times.
4. **Memory leaks.** The program should free up any memory that it allocates, otherwise it will eventually run out of memory and crash.
5. **Race conditions.** If multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time, it is possible for them to corrupt the data or cause the program to crash.
6. **Synchronization errors.** When multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is important to ensure that only one thread is accessing the data at a time. This can be done using locks or semaphores.
7. **Deadlocks.** If two threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, they can deadlock, which means that neither thread can continue execution.
8. **Buffer overflows.** If a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, it can overwrite other data in memory, which can lead to security vulnerabilities or crashes.
9. **Format string vulnerabilities.** If a program uses a format string incorrectly, it can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.
10. **SQL injection attacks.** If a program does not properly sanitize user input, it can allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database, which can lead to data theft or denial of service attacks.

AIZU p02027 Presents

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is "N K", where N and K are integers. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The program needs to calculate the number of sets that satisfy the conditions. If the calculation is incorrect, the output will be wrong.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. The program needs to keep track of the number of sets that satisfy the conditions. If there is an off-by-one error, the output will be wrong.
4. **Memory errors**. The program needs to allocate memory for the sets. If there is a memory error, the program will crash.
5. **Timeout errors**. The program needs to finish within a certain amount of time. If the program does not finish within the time limit, it will be timed out.

**Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs**

1. **Off-by-one errors.** When computing the number of strings with at least K characters, it is important to make sure that you don't count the empty string as having 0 characters.
2. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic.** When computing the remainder of a number divided by 998244353, it is important to use the correct modulus operator. In Python, this is `%`.
3. **Incorrect use of factorials.** When computing the number of ways to choose K characters from a set of M characters, it is important to use the correct factorial formula. In Python, this is `math.factorial(M)`.
4. **Incorrect use of Binomial coefficients.** When computing the number of ways to arrange K characters from a set of M characters, it is important to use the correct binomial coefficient formula. In Python, this is `math.comb(M, K)`.
5. **Incorrect use of the Sieve of Eratosthenes.** When computing the number of prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer, it is important to use the correct Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. In Python, there are several libraries that implement this algorithm.

**Additional Tips**

* When solving problems involving combinatorics, it is often helpful to use the following identity:

```
nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!)
```

* When solving problems involving modular arithmetic, it is often helpful to use the following lemma:

```
(a + b) % m = (a % m + b % m) % m
```

* When solving problems involving the Sieve of Eratosthenes, it is often helpful to use the following fact:

```
If p is a prime number, then all numbers of the form p^k are also prime numbers.

Title:
AIZU p02310 Tangent to a Circle

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect calculation of distance between two points.** The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the formula $\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}$. It is important to make sure that you are using the correct order of operations when calculating this distance, and that you are not rounding the values until the very end.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the slope of a line.** The slope of a line is given by the formula $\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. It is important to make sure that you are using the correct order of operations when calculating this slope, and that you are not rounding the values until the very end.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the equation of a line.** The equation of a line can be written in the form $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope of the line and $b$ is the y-intercept. It is important to make sure that you are using the correct values for $m$ and $b$ when writing the equation of the line.
4. **Incorrect identification of the tangent points.** The tangent points of a circle are the points where the circle is intersected by a line that is perpendicular to the radius of the circle. It is important to make sure that you are correctly identifying the tangent points, and that you are not including any points that are not actually tangent to the circle.
5. **Incorrect output of the tangent points.** The tangent points of a circle should be outputted in the format $(x, y)$, where $x$ and $y$ are the coordinates of the tangent points. It is important to make sure that you are correctly formatting the output, and that you are not rounding the values until the very end.

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem states that multiple elements can have equivalent values in $S$. This means that we need to use a data structure that can store multiple values for each key. A hash table or dictionary would be a good choice for this problem.
* **Incorrect implementation of the insert, find, delete, and dump operations.** The developer must be careful to correctly implement these operations so that the output is correct. For example, the insert operation must increment the number of elements in $S$ by 1, and the delete operation must decrement the number of elements in $S$ by 1.
* **Incorrect handling of errors.** The problem does not specify any error conditions. The developer must be careful to handle any errors that may occur, such as invalid input or attempts to access a nonexistent element in $S$.
* **Incorrect output format.** The problem specifies that the output should be printed in a specific format. The developer must be careful to follow this format so that the output is correct.

By following these tips, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving this problem.
