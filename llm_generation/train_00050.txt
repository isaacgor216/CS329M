Title:
CODECHEF lebombs

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain a string of characters other than 0 and 1. The developer should check the input format and raise an error if it is incorrect.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not always correct. For example, the output may contain a string of characters other than 0 and 1. The developer should check the output format and raise an error if it is incorrect.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of buildings that will not be destroyed.** The developer may incorrectly calculate the number of buildings that will not be destroyed. For example, the developer may not consider the fact that a bomb that explodes in the first building will also destroy the second building. The developer should carefully calculate the number of buildings that will not be destroyed.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The developer may incorrectly handle edge cases. For example, the developer may not handle the case where the number of buildings is 1. The developer should carefully handle all edge cases.

Title:
CODECHEF pntng

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of integers. However, the developer may accidentally use a different data type, such as a string or a float. This can lead to incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect calculation**

The developer may make a mistake in the calculation of the minimum cost. For example, they may forget to add the cost of painting the first layer or they may add the cost of painting the same cell twice.

**3. Incomplete code**

The developer may forget to write some of the code, such as the code to read the input data or the code to output the result. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

**4. Runtime errors**

The developer may make a mistake that causes the program to run into a runtime error. For example, they may try to divide by zero or they may access a memory location that does not exist. This can cause the program to crash.

**5. Logic errors**

The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program. For example, they may assume that a certain condition is always true when it is not. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results.
Test inputs:

Title:
CODECHEF subarray

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly matching opening and closing parentheses.** This is the most common error that programmers make when solving this problem. Make sure that you are correctly matching opening and closing parentheses in the character array.
2. **Not considering the case where the maximum sum sub-array does not have balanced parentheses.** In this case, the answer is simply the maximum sum of the integers in the array.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm to find the maximum sum sub-array.** There are many different algorithms for finding the maximum sum sub-array, and not all of them are correct. Make sure that you are using an algorithm that is guaranteed to find the correct answer.
4. **Not handling edge cases correctly.** There are a few edge cases that you need to be aware of when solving this problem. For example, what happens if the input array is empty? What happens if the input array contains only one element?
5. **Not using efficient data structures.** Using efficient data structures can help you to solve this problem faster. For example, using a binary search tree to store the parentheses in the character array can help you to quickly find the matching opening and closing parentheses.
6. **Not using efficient algorithms.** Using efficient algorithms can help you to solve this problem faster. For example, using a dynamic programming algorithm to find the maximum sum sub-array can help you to avoid recalculating the same sub-array multiple times.
7. **Not debugging your code correctly.** It is important to debug your code carefully to make sure that it is correct. This includes checking for logical errors, syntax errors, and runtime errors.

By following these tips, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 100_B. Friendly Numbers

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is a little tricky. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly. For example, if you forget to add a space between the numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem must be either "FRIENDS" or "NOT FRIENDS". Make sure that you are not accidentally printing any extra characters, such as a newline or a space.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When checking if two numbers are friends, it is important to make sure that you are not accidentally checking if one number is divisible by the other number plus one. For example, if you are checking if 12 is divisible by 6, you should check if 12 % 6 == 0, not if 12 % 7 == 0.

**4. Undefined behavior**

The C++ standard does not specify what should happen if you divide a number by zero. This means that your program could potentially crash if you try to divide a number by zero. To avoid this, you should always check if the denominator is non-zero before dividing.

**5. Memory leaks**

When you allocate memory on the heap, you are responsible for freeing that memory when you are finished with it. If you forget to free the memory, you will eventually run out of memory and your program will crash. To avoid this, make sure that you are freeing all of the memory that you allocate.

**6. Race conditions**

When multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is possible for one thread to overwrite the changes that another thread has made. This can lead to incorrect results or even a crash. To avoid this, you should use synchronization primitives to ensure that only one thread can access the data at a time.

**7. Deadlocks**

When two threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, it is possible for them to get stuck in a deadlock. This means that neither thread can continue running, and the program will eventually crash. To avoid this, you should make sure that each thread releases all of the locks that it holds before it waits for another lock.

**8. Security vulnerabilities**

When writing code, it is important to make sure that you are not introducing any security vulnerabilities. For example, you should never accept user input without validating it first. You should also make sure that your code is not vulnerable to buffer overflows or other attacks.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1032_F. Vasya and Maximum Matching

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a tree with n vertices. If we use an integer array to store the edges, then the maximum value of n is 3 * 10^5. An integer array can only store numbers up to 2^31 - 1, which is much smaller than 3 * 10^5. So we need to use a long long array to store the edges.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem is about finding the number of ways to delete some edges so that the maximum matching in the resulting graph is unique. We can use the following algorithm:

1. Find all the maximum matchings in the tree.
2. For each maximum matching, count the number of ways to delete some edges so that the matching is still a maximum matching.
3. Add up the results from all the maximum matchings.

The problem is that the number of maximum matchings in a tree can be exponential in the number of vertices. So the above algorithm is too slow.

**3. Not using the modulo operator**

The output of the problem is a number modulo 998244353. So we need to use the modulo operator when doing calculations.

**4. Making a mistake in the calculation**

The calculation in the above algorithm is a bit complicated. It is easy to make a mistake. We need to be careful when doing the calculation.

CODEFORCES 1055_D. Refactoring

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to unexpected errors. For example, if the number of variables is not an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input variables may not be correct. For example, if the initial names of variables are strings, but the target names are integers, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect. For example, the program may not correctly check if all variables can be renamed in one run of the "massive refactoring" command.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The program may make off-by-one errors when processing the input data. For example, the program may skip a variable or count a variable twice.
5. **Memory leaks**. The program may not correctly release memory after it is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually crash the program.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may have security vulnerabilities, such as allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1077_E. Thematic Contests

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of integers. If the developer accidentally reads the data as a list of strings, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the number of problems in each contest**

The number of problems in each contest is calculated as the product of the number of problems in the previous contest and 2. However, the developer may accidentally divide instead of multiply. This will lead to an incorrect answer.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of problems**

The maximum number of problems is calculated by summing the number of problems in each contest. However, the developer may accidentally add instead of multiply. This will lead to an incorrect answer.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output should be a single integer. However, the developer may accidentally output multiple integers or a string. This will lead to a compilation error.

**5. Incorrect error handling**

The program should handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input data is invalid, the program should print an error message and exit. However, the developer may accidentally ignore the errors or crash the program. This will lead to a bad user experience.

**6. Inefficient algorithm**

The naive algorithm for solving this problem has a time complexity of O(n^2). This is too slow for large inputs. The developer can improve the performance of the algorithm by using a more efficient data structure or by using a more efficient algorithm.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1098_D. Eels

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong data type. For example, a weight of an eel may be represented as a string instead of an integer. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. The program may miss one or more eels when calculating the danger. This can lead to the program producing incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The program may use incorrect logic to calculate the danger. This can lead to the program producing incorrect output.
5. **Memory leaks**. The program may not release memory that it has allocated. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions**. The program may not be thread-safe. This can lead to incorrect output if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may be vulnerable to attacks such as buffer overflows or SQL injection. This can allow attackers to gain access to the program's data or even the system itself.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the program thoroughly with a variety of input data. Finally, it is important to use a secure coding style to minimize the risk of security vulnerabilities.

CODEFORCES 1119_E. Pavel and Triangles

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly parsed by the developer, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the developer may not handle this case correctly and return an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of triangles**. The developer may not correctly calculate the maximum number of triangles that can be made from the given sticks. For example, the developer may not take into account the fact that some sticks may be of the same length, or that some sticks may not be used in any triangles.
3. **Incorrect output**. The developer may not correctly format the output, or may not output the correct answer. For example, the developer may output the number of triangles in scientific notation, or may output the number of triangles as a floating-point number.
4. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the developer may not handle errors correctly, or may not use the most efficient algorithm to solve the problem.

CODEFORCES 1146_B. Hate "A"

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of `s.find()`**.

```
def find_first_a(s):
    return s.find('a')
```

This code will return the index of the first `'a'` character in the string `s`. However, if there is no `'a'` character in the string, this code will return `-1`. This can lead to incorrect results if you are not expecting it.

To avoid this problem, you can use the following code instead:

```
def find_first_a(s):
    if 'a' not in s:
        return -1
    return s.find('a')
```

This code will return `-1` if there is no `'a'` character in the string, and the correct index of the first `'a'` character if there is one.

2. **Incorrect use of `s.replace()`**.

```
def remove_all_a(s):
    return s.replace('a', '')
```

This code will replace all occurrences of the character `'a'` in the string `s` with the empty string. However, if there are no `'a'` characters in the string, this code will return the original string. This can lead to incorrect results if you are not expecting it.

To avoid this problem, you can use the following code instead:

```
def remove_all_a(s):
    if 'a' not in s:
        return s
    return s.replace('a', '')
```

This code will return the original string if there are no `'a'` characters in the string, and the string with all occurrences of the character `'a'` replaced with the empty string if there are any.

3. **Incorrect use of `s.split()`**.

```
def split_string(s, sep):
    return s.split(sep)
```

This code will split the string `s` into a list of substrings, using the character `sep` as the delimiter. However, if the character `sep` does not appear in the string `s`, this code will return a list with one element: the original string. This can lead to incorrect results if you are not expecting it.

To avoid this problem, you can use the following code instead:

```
def split_string(s, sep):
    if sep not in s:
        return [s]
    return s.split(sep)
```

This code will return a list with one element if the character `sep` does not appear in the string `s`, and a list of substrings if the character `sep` does appear in the string `s`.

4. **Incorrect use of `s.join()`**.

```
def join_strings(list_of_strings, sep):
    return sep.join(list_of_strings)
```

This code will join the elements of the list `list_of_strings` together with the character `sep` as the delimiter. However, if the list `list_of_strings` is empty, this code will return the empty string. This can lead to incorrect results if you are not expecting it.

To avoid this problem, you can use the following code instead:

```
def join_strings(list_of_strings, sep):
    if not list_of_strings:
        return ''
    return sep.join(list_of_strings)
```

This code will return the empty string if the list `list_of_strings` is empty, and the joined string if the list `list_of_strings` is not empty.

5. **Incorrect use of `len()`**.

```
def get_length(s):
    return len(s)
```

This code will return the length of the string `s`. However, if the string `s` is empty, this code will return `0`. This can lead to incorrect results if you are not expecting it.

To avoid this problem, you can use the following code instead:

```
def get_length(s):
    if not s:
        return 0
    return len(s)
```

This code will return `0` if the string `s` is empty, and the length of the string `s` if the string `s` is not empty.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1204_C. Anna, Svyatoslav and Maps

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very clear. It is not immediately obvious what the format of the adjacency matrix is, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you accidentally read the first row of the matrix as a list of numbers instead of a list of characters, you will get an incorrect answer.

**2. Incorrect graph representation**

The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix. This is a common way to represent graphs, but it can be easy to make mistakes when creating the matrix. For example, if you accidentally add a self-loop to a vertex, you will get an incorrect answer.

**3. Incorrect path representation**

The path is represented as a list of vertices. This is a common way to represent paths, but it can be easy to make mistakes when creating the list. For example, if you accidentally include a vertex that is not in the graph, you will get an incorrect answer.

**4. Incorrect shortest path calculation**

The shortest path between two vertices in a graph can be calculated using Dijkstra's algorithm. However, it is easy to make mistakes when implementing Dijkstra's algorithm. For example, if you accidentally use the wrong data structure to store the distances to the vertices, you will get an incorrect answer.

**5. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is not very clear. It is not immediately obvious what the format of the output should be, and it is easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if you accidentally print the lengths of the shortest paths instead of the shortest paths themselves, you will get an incorrect answer.

**6. Incorrect runtime**

The time complexity of the solution should be O(V * E), where V is the number of vertices in the graph and E is the number of edges in the graph. However, it is easy to write a solution that has a worse time complexity. For example, if you use a naive algorithm to calculate the shortest paths, your solution will have a time complexity of O(V^2 * E).

**7. Incorrect memory usage**

The memory usage of the solution should be O(V), where V is the number of vertices in the graph. However, it is easy to write a solution that uses more memory. For example, if you use a data structure that stores all of the vertices in the graph, your solution will use more memory than necessary.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1350_D. Orac and Medians

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the median calculation algorithm.** The median of a set of numbers is the middle number when the numbers are sorted in ascending order. A common mistake is to calculate the median of an unsorted set of numbers, which will not produce the correct result.
2. **Incorrect use of the median-of-medians algorithm.** The median-of-medians algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that can be used to find the median of a large set of numbers efficiently. A common mistake is to use the median-of-medians algorithm on a set of numbers that is already sorted, which will not improve the running time of the algorithm.
3. **Incorrect handling of degenerate cases.** The median-of-medians algorithm can sometimes degenerate into a linear-time algorithm. This happens when the set of numbers is already sorted or when the set of numbers contains a large number of duplicate values. A common mistake is to not handle these degenerate cases correctly, which can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect use of the sorting algorithm.** The sorting algorithm used to sort the set of numbers before calculating the median can have a significant impact on the running time of the algorithm. A common mistake is to use a sorting algorithm that is not suited for the size of the set of numbers, which can lead to a significant slowdown.
5. **Incorrect implementation of the output format.** The output format for the median-of-medians algorithm is very specific. A common mistake is to not format the output correctly, which can lead to the algorithm being rejected by the judge.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1418_B. Negative Prefixes

Pain points:
**Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs**

* **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** This is the most common mistake that people make when solving this problem. The problem asks you to find the minimum possible value of `k`, which is the maximum index `j` such that `p_j < 0`. This means that you need to find a way to rearrange the values in the array so that the sum of the first `j` elements is as small as possible.
* **Not considering all possible cases.** The problem statement does not specify how the locked positions are locked. This means that you need to consider all possible ways that the locked positions could be locked. For example, if the first position is locked, then you cannot rearrange any of the values in the array.
* **Using incorrect algorithms.** There are many different algorithms that you can use to solve this problem. However, not all of them are correct. Make sure that you use an algorithm that is guaranteed to find the optimal solution.
* **Making implementation errors.** Even if you understand the problem and use the correct algorithm, you can still make implementation errors. Make sure that you carefully check your code for errors before submitting it.

Here are some specific examples of problems and bugs that people have encountered when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** One common mistake that people make is to think that the goal is to find the minimum possible value of `p_n`. This is incorrect. The goal is to find the minimum possible value of `k`.
* **Not considering all possible cases.** Another common mistake is to only consider the case where the locked positions are all at the beginning of the array. However, the locked positions could be anywhere in the array.
* **Using incorrect algorithms.** One incorrect algorithm that people sometimes use is to simply sort the array and then take the first `n - k` elements. This algorithm does not always work because it does not take into account the locked positions.
* **Making implementation errors.** One common implementation error is to forget to check if the array is empty. If the array is empty, then the answer is `0`.

**How to Avoid These Problems**

To avoid these problems, you should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand it. You should also carefully consider all possible cases and make sure that your algorithm works for all of them. Finally, you should carefully check your code for errors before submitting it.

CODEFORCES 1436_A. Reorder

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not strictly defined. For example, the input could contain a space between the two integers in the first line, or the second line could contain multiple spaces between the integers. The developer should make sure to handle all possible input formats correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem is also not strictly defined. For example, the output could contain a newline character after the answer, or the answer could be capitalized. The developer should make sure to output the answer in the correct format.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the sum**. The sum in the problem is defined as $\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\sum_{j=i}^{n}{(a_j)/(j)}}$. The developer should make sure to calculate this sum correctly, taking into account the fact that the inner sum is calculated over the range $[i, n]$.
4. **Incorrect reasoning about the reordering of the elements**. The problem states that it is forbidden to delete elements as well as insert new elements. The developer should make sure to reason about the reordering of the elements correctly, taking into account this constraint.
5. **Incorrect implementation of the solution**. The developer should make sure to implement the solution correctly, using the correct data structures and algorithms.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The developer may incorrectly parse the input, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the developer may assume that the input is always in the format `n m`, when in reality it could be in the format `n m a_1 a_2 ... a_n`.
* **Incorrect output format:** The developer may incorrectly format the output, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the developer may output the answer as `YES` instead of `yes`.
* **Incorrect calculation of the sum:** The developer may incorrectly calculate the sum, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the developer may forget to add the first term of the inner sum to the total sum.
* **Incorrect reasoning about the reordering of the elements:** The developer may incorrectly reason about the reordering of the elements, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the developer may assume that it is possible to reorder the elements in any way, when in reality there may be constraints on the order of the elements.
* **Incorrect implementation of the solution:** The developer may incorrectly implement the solution, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the developer may use an inefficient algorithm to solve the problem, or the developer may make a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm.

Title:
CODEFORCES 145_D. Lucky Pair

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data contains integers from 1 to 109, so we need to use a data type that can store such large numbers. The most common mistake is to use `int` or `long`, which can only store numbers up to 2^31-1 or 2^63-1, respectively. This is not enough for our problem, so we need to use a larger data type, such as `long long`.

**2. Not handling the edge cases**

The input data may contain some edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with only one element. We need to make sure that our code handles these cases correctly.

**3. Making a mistake in the algorithm**

The algorithm for solving this problem is not very complicated, but it is still possible to make a mistake. We need to be careful to make sure that our algorithm is correct.

**4. Not testing the code**

It is always important to test your code before submitting it to a competition. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed.

**5. Submitting the wrong code**

It is easy to make a mistake when submitting your code to a competition. Make sure that you have carefully proofread your code before submitting it.

CODEFORCES 1485_F. Copy or Prefix Sum

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the prefix sum array.** The prefix sum array is a very important data structure for solving this problem. It stores the sum of the first `i` elements of the input array. If the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, then the prefix sum array would be `[1, 3, 6, 10]`.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When computing the number of hybrid arrays, it is important to make sure that you are not counting the same array twice. For example, if the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, then the hybrid arrays `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `[2, 3, 4, 5]` are not considered to be different.
3. **Incorrect modulo arithmetic.** When computing the number of hybrid arrays, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct modulo arithmetic. For example, if the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, then the number of hybrid arrays is `3` modulo `10^9 + 7`, not `4`.
4. **Inefficient algorithms.** There are more efficient algorithms for solving this problem than the one that is presented in the solution. For example, it is possible to solve the problem in `O(n)` time instead of the `O(n^2)` time that is used in the solution.

Title:
CODEFORCES 150_D. Mission Impassable

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very clear. It is not clear how to handle the case when the input string is empty. Additionally, it is not clear how to handle the case when the input string contains non-lowercase Latin letters.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also not very clear. It is not clear how to handle the case when the maximum number of points is 0. Additionally, it is not clear how to handle the case when the maximum number of points is greater than 10^9.

**3. Incorrect data type**

The input and output data types for this problem are not very clear. It is not clear how to handle the case when the input string contains negative numbers. Additionally, it is not clear how to handle the case when the input string contains numbers that are greater than 10^9.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

It is possible to make off-by-one errors when computing the maximum number of points that can be earned. For example, if the input string is "abacaba" and the input array is [1, 5, -1, -1, -1, -1, 10], it is possible to mistakenly compute the maximum number of points as 16 instead of 17.

**5. Runtime errors**

It is possible to make runtime errors when computing the maximum number of points that can be earned. For example, if the input string is very long, it is possible to run out of memory. Additionally, it is possible to run into a stack overflow if the input string is very long.

**6. Logical errors**

It is possible to make logical errors when computing the maximum number of points that can be earned. For example, it is possible to mistakenly assume that all palindromes are of even length. Additionally, it is possible to mistakenly assume that all palindromes are of odd length.
Test inputs:
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 1536_B. Prinzessin der Verurteilung

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of `set`.** A `set` is a data structure that stores unique elements in no particular order. This means that if you add two elements that are equal, only one of them will be stored in the set. This can lead to incorrect results if you are not careful.
2. **Incorrect use of `map`.** A `map` is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. This means that you can use a `map` to associate a value with each element in a set. This can be useful for finding the MEX of a string, as you can use a `map` to store the longest substring that does not appear in the string.
3. **Incorrect use of `sort`.** The `sort` function can be used to sort a list of elements in ascending or descending order. This can be useful for finding the MEX of a string, as you can use `sort` to find the smallest substring that does not appear in the string.
4. **Incorrect use of `min` and `max`.** The `min` and `max` functions can be used to find the smallest and largest element in a list of elements. This can be useful for finding the MEX of a string, as you can use `min` and `max` to find the smallest substring that does not appear in the string.
5. **Incorrect use of `index`.** The `index` function can be used to find the index of an element in a list of elements. This can be useful for finding the MEX of a string, as you can use `index` to find the index of the first substring that does not appear in the string.

To avoid these problems, it is important to understand the correct use of these data structures and functions. It is also important to test your code thoroughly to ensure that it is working correctly.

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input format is not very clear. It is not clear what the different characters in the input represent. For example, what does "000E0T3" mean? Is it a row of the map, or is it something else?
* The output format is also not very clear. It is not clear what the output should be. For example, in the first example, the output is "3". What does this mean? Is it the number of mikemon battles that the breeder must participate in?
* The problem statement does not specify how the breeders will move. For example, in the first example, the three breeders on the left side of the map could all move to the same cell and battle the breeder, or they could all move to different cells and not battle the breeder.
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if the breeder does not move. For example, in the second example, the breeder could stay in the same cell and not battle any of the other breeders.
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if the breeder moves to a cell that is occupied by a tree. For example, in the third example, the breeder could move to the cell that is occupied by a tree and get stuck.

**Possible solutions:**

* The input format could be improved by using a more descriptive format. For example, the input could be a list of lists, where each list represents a row of the map. Each element in the list could be a character representing the content of the cell.
* The output format could be improved by using a more descriptive format. For example, the output could be the number of mikemon battles that the breeder must participate in.
* The problem statement could be improved by specifying how the breeders will move. For example, the breeders could be required to move to the nearest empty cell that is not occupied by a tree.
* The problem statement could be improved by specifying what happens if the breeder does not move. For example, the breeder could be penalized for not moving.
* The problem statement could be improved by specifying what happens if the breeder moves to a cell that is occupied by a tree. For example, the breeder could be penalized for moving to a cell that is occupied by a tree.

CODEFORCES 396_C. On Changing Tree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the segment tree**

The segment tree is a data structure that can be used to efficiently answer range queries on a given array. However, if the implementation of the segment tree is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the segment tree is not initialized correctly, it may not be able to answer range queries correctly. Additionally, if the segment tree is not updated correctly, it may not be able to answer range queries on the updated array correctly.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the DFS traversal**

The DFS traversal is a recursive algorithm that can be used to traverse a tree. However, if the implementation of the DFS traversal is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the DFS traversal does not visit all of the vertices in the tree, it may not be able to answer all of the queries correctly. Additionally, if the DFS traversal does not visit the vertices in the correct order, it may not be able to answer the queries correctly.

**3. Incorrect implementation of the update function**

The update function is used to update the values in the segment tree. However, if the implementation of the update function is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the update function does not update the values in the segment tree correctly, it may not be able to answer range queries correctly. Additionally, if the update function updates the values in the segment tree in the wrong order, it may not be able to answer the queries correctly.

**4. Incorrect implementation of the query function**

The query function is used to query the values in the segment tree. However, if the implementation of the query function is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the query function does not query the values in the segment tree correctly, it may not be able to answer range queries correctly. Additionally, if the query function queries the values in the segment tree in the wrong order, it may not be able to answer the queries correctly.

**5. Incorrect handling of overflow**

When performing arithmetic operations on large numbers, it is important to be careful to avoid overflow. If overflow occurs, it can lead to incorrect results. For example, if two numbers are added together and the result overflows, the sum will be incorrect. Additionally, if two numbers are multiplied together and the result overflows, the product will be incorrect.

**6. Incorrect handling of negative numbers**

When performing arithmetic operations on negative numbers, it is important to be careful to avoid errors. For example, if two negative numbers are added together, the sum will be a negative number. Additionally, if two negative numbers are multiplied together, the product will be a positive number.

**7. Incorrect handling of zero**

When performing arithmetic operations on zero, it is important to be careful to avoid errors. For example, if zero is added to a number, the result will be the same number. Additionally, if zero is multiplied by a number, the product will be zero.

**8. Incorrect handling of infinity**

When performing arithmetic operations on infinity, it is important to be careful to avoid errors. For example, if infinity is added to a number, the result will be infinity. Additionally, if infinity is multiplied by a number, the product will be infinity.

CODEFORCES 467_C. George and Job

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the second line should contain `n` integers `p1`, `p2`, ..., `pn`. However, a developer may accidentally mistype the input format and expect the first line to contain `n` and `m`, and the second line to contain `k` and `p1`, `p2`, ..., `pn`. This would cause the program to crash when it tries to read the input.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum possible value of `sum`.** The maximum possible value of `sum` is the sum of the largest `k` elements of the input array. However, a developer may accidentally calculate the sum of the first `k` elements of the array, or the sum of the last `k` elements of the array. This would result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect use of the `max()` function.** The `max()` function returns the largest element of a given array. However, a developer may accidentally use the `max()` function to return the sum of the elements of an array. This would result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** A developer may accidentally miscalculate the indices of the elements of the input array. This could result in the program skipping over some elements of the array, or including some elements of the array twice. This would result in an incorrect answer.
5. **Memory leaks.** A developer may accidentally create a memory leak by allocating memory that is never freed. This could eventually cause the program to crash.
6. **Synchronization issues.** A developer may accidentally create a synchronization issue by accessing shared data from multiple threads without proper synchronization. This could result in the program producing incorrect results or crashing.
7. **Security vulnerabilities.** A developer may accidentally introduce a security vulnerability by allowing untrusted users to input data into the program. This could allow attackers to gain access to sensitive data or to execute arbitrary code on the system.

CODEFORCES 513_G1. Inversions problem

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific. Make sure that you are reading the input correctly.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. When computing the expected value of the number of inversions, it is easy to make a mistake and forget to add or subtract 1. Be careful when doing these calculations.
3. **Incorrect array indexing**. When iterating over the array of permutations, it is easy to make a mistake and index the array incorrectly. Make sure that you are using the correct indices.
4. **Floating-point errors**. When computing the expected value of the number of inversions, it is important to use the correct floating-point arithmetic. Make sure that you are using the `double` data type and that you are rounding your answers to the correct number of decimal places.
5. **Time complexity**. The time complexity of your solution should be $O(n \log n)$. Make sure that you are not using a more inefficient algorithm.
6. **Space complexity**. The space complexity of your solution should be $O(n)$. Make sure that you are not using more space than necessary.

CODEFORCES 589_b

Pain points:
1. **Not understanding the problem.** The problem is about maximizing the volume of a cake that can be baked from a given set of cake layers. The cake must have the shape of a rectangular parallelepiped and each layer must be the same size. The cake layers can be rotated in the horizontal plane.
2. **Not using the right data structures.** The input data is a list of pairs of integers, representing the length and width of each cake layer. The output data is a pair of integers, representing the length and width of the resulting cake. A list of pairs of integers can be represented using a list of tuples. The output data can be represented using a tuple.
3. **Not using the right algorithms.** The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The algorithm works by iteratively choosing the cake layer that has the largest area and adding it to the cake. The algorithm terminates when all of the cake layers have been used.
4. **Not handling corner cases.** The problem statement does not specify what to do if there are no cake layers or if all of the cake layers have the same size. The algorithm should handle these cases gracefully.
5. **Not testing the code.** It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly. The code should be tested with a variety of input data, including edge cases.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly computing the area of a cake layer.** The area of a cake layer is equal to the product of its length and width. A developer might incorrectly compute the area by adding the length and width together.
* **Not considering all of the cake layers.** The algorithm should iterate over all of the cake layers in the input data. A developer might accidentally skip over some of the cake layers.
* **Not handling corner cases.** The algorithm should handle the cases where there are no cake layers or where all of the cake layers have the same size. A developer might accidentally crash the program in these cases.
* **Not testing the code.** The code should be tested with a variety of input data, including edge cases. A developer might accidentally miss a bug if they do not test the code thoroughly.

3. **Off-by-one error.** The developer may accidentally miscount the number of elements in an array or the number of times a loop iterates. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect boundary conditions.** The developer may not handle boundary conditions correctly. For example, the developer may not check if an array is empty or if a number is negative. This can lead to incorrect results or runtime errors.
5. **Memory leak.** The developer may not properly free memory that is allocated during the execution of the program. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
6. **Race condition.** The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data between multiple threads. This can lead to incorrect results or data corruption.
7. **Deadlock.** The developer may create a situation where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, which prevents any of the threads from making progress. This can eventually cause the program to deadlock and stop responding.
8. **Buffer overflow.** The developer may write data to a buffer that is not large enough to hold the data. This can lead to data corruption or a program crash.
9. **Format string vulnerability.** The developer may use a format string that is not properly escaped, which can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.
10. **SQL injection vulnerability.** The developer may not properly sanitize user input before using it in a SQL query, which can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL statements on the database.

CODEFORCES 705_C. Thor

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrectly counting the number of unread notifications.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. It is important to remember that the number of unread notifications is not the same as the number of notifications that have been generated. For example, if an application generates a notification and then Thor reads it, the number of unread notifications will decrease by 1, but the number of notifications that have been generated will remain the same.
* **Not handling all of the possible types of events correctly.** The problem statement specifies three types of events: application generates a notification, Thor reads all notifications generated by an application, and Thor reads the first t notifications generated by all applications. It is important to make sure that your code handles all of these types of events correctly.
* **Using incorrect data structures.** The data structures that you use to store the notifications and the applications can have a significant impact on the performance of your code. It is important to choose data structures that are appropriate for the problem you are solving.
* **Not using efficient algorithms.** The algorithms that you use to solve the problem can also have a significant impact on the performance of your code. It is important to choose algorithms that are efficient for the problem you are solving.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems and bugs:

* **Test your code thoroughly.** One of the best ways to find bugs in your code is to test it thoroughly. This means testing your code with a variety of inputs and expected outputs.
* **Use a debugger.** A debugger can be a helpful tool for finding bugs in your code. A debugger allows you to step through your code line by line and see how it is executing. This can help you identify problems that you might not be able to find by just looking at the code.
* **Ask for help.** If you are stuck on a problem, don't be afraid to ask for help. There are many online resources available, such as forums and Stack Overflow. You can also ask your friends or colleagues for help.

CODEFORCES 749_A. Bachgold Problem

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the Sieve of Eratosthenes**. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a very efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit. However, it is important to use it correctly. One common mistake is to start the sieve with a number that is not prime. For example, if you start the sieve with 2, you will miss all the odd primes.
2. **Using a brute-force approach**. A brute-force approach is an algorithm that simply tries every possible combination of values until it finds a solution. This approach can be very inefficient, especially for large problems.
3. **Not handling special cases correctly**. There are a few special cases that you need to handle correctly when solving the Bachgold problem. For example, if n is prime, then the only solution is n = p.
4. **Using incorrect data types**. It is important to use the correct data types when solving the Bachgold problem. For example, if you use an integer to represent n, you will not be able to represent numbers larger than 2^31-1.
5. **Not using efficient algorithms**. There are a number of efficient algorithms that you can use to solve the Bachgold problem. For example, you can use the Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovász algorithm or the AKS primality test.
6. **Not testing your code**. It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it to a competition. This will help you catch any bugs and ensure that your code is correct.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. **Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes correctly**. Make sure to start the sieve with a prime number. You can also use a modified version of the sieve that starts with 2 and marks all even numbers as composite.
2. **Don't use a brute-force approach**. The Bachgold problem can be solved much more efficiently than a brute-force approach. Use an algorithm like the Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovász algorithm or the AKS primality test.
3. **Handle special cases correctly**. Make sure to handle the special cases of n = 1 and n = prime correctly.
4. **Use the correct data types**. Use an integer data type to represent n. If you need to represent numbers larger than 2^31-1, use a long integer data type.
5. **Use efficient algorithms**. Use an efficient algorithm to solve the Bachgold problem. This will help you solve the problem faster and with less memory usage.
6. **Test your code**. Thoroughly test your code before submitting it to a competition. This will help you catch any bugs and ensure that your code is correct.

CODEFORCES 817_B. Makes And The Product

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the input/output.** The input and output of this problem are both integers, so you need to make sure that you are using the correct data type when reading and writing the data. For example, if you try to read the input as a string, you will get an error.
2. **Not handling edge cases correctly.** The input for this problem specifies that `n` must be at least 3. If you try to run the code with a value of `n` less than 3, you will get an error.
3. **Making a mistake in your algorithm.** The algorithm for this problem is relatively simple, but it is still possible to make a mistake. For example, you might forget to account for the fact that the minimum possible product is 1.
4. **Not using efficient data structures.** The input for this problem is a list of integers. You can use a variety of data structures to store this list, but some data structures will be more efficient than others. For example, you could use a list, a set, or a heap.
5. **Not using the right algorithm.** There are a number of different algorithms that you could use to solve this problem. The best algorithm for you to use will depend on the specific constraints of the problem.
6. **Not testing your code thoroughly.** It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it to the judge. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Using the wrong data type for the input/output:** If you try to read the input as a string, you will get an error. For example, the following code will not work:

```
n = input()
```

This code will try to read the input as a string, but the input is actually a list of integers. To fix this, you need to change the type of the input variable to `list`:

```
n = list(input())
```

* **Not handling edge cases correctly:** The input for this problem specifies that `n` must be at least 3. If you try to run the code with a value of `n` less than 3, you will get an error. For example, the following code will not work:

```
n = int(input())
if n < 3:
    raise ValueError("n must be at least 3")
```

This code will check if `n` is less than 3 and raise an error if it is. To fix this, you need to change the code so that it does not run if `n` is less than 3. For example, you could use the following code:

```
if n < 3:
    return
```

* **Making a mistake in your algorithm:** The algorithm for this problem is relatively simple, but it is still possible to make a mistake. For example, you might forget to account for the fact that the minimum possible product is 1. To avoid this mistake, you should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand the requirements.

* **Not using efficient data structures:** The input for this problem is a list of integers. You can use a variety of data structures to store this list, but some data structures will be more efficient than others. For example, you could use a list, a set, or a heap. To find the most efficient data structure to use, you need to consider the specific constraints of the problem.

* **Not using the right algorithm:** There are a number of different algorithms that you could use to solve this problem. The best algorithm for you to use will depend on the specific constraints of the problem. For example, if the input is very large, you might want to use a divide-and-conquer algorithm.

* **Not testing your code thoroughly:** It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it to the judge. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed. You should test your code with a variety of different inputs, including both valid and invalid inputs. You should also test your code with different data types.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input is "46 2", the program may expect two integers separated by a space, but instead it gets a single integer followed by a space. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong type, which can also lead to errors. For example, if the input is "46 2.0", the program may expect two integers, but instead it gets a floating-point number. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The program may make mistakes in its calculations, which can lead to incorrect output. For example, if the program is supposed to find the square root of a number, but it uses the wrong formula, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The program may make mistakes in its indexing, which can lead to incorrect output. For example, if the program is supposed to print the first 10 elements of a list, but it starts at index 1 instead of index 0, the output will be incorrect.
5. **Memory leaks**. The program may not properly release memory that it has allocated, which can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions**. The program may not be thread-safe, which can lead to errors if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.
7. **Deadlocks**. The program may deadlock if two or more threads are waiting for each other to finish, but neither thread can progress.
8. **Buffer overflows**. The program may write data to a buffer that is too small, which can overwrite other data in memory and lead to security vulnerabilities.

Title:
CODEFORCES 987_B. High School: Become Human

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input values are very large, so we need to use a data type that can store them. The default data type in Python is `int`, which can only store integers up to 2^31-1. This is not enough for our problem, so we need to use a larger data type, such as `long`.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The naive algorithm for comparing two numbers is to multiply them together. This is very inefficient for large numbers, as it takes a lot of time and memory. A more efficient algorithm is to use logarithms.

**3. Not handling overflow correctly**

When multiplying two large numbers, it is possible to get an overflow error. This happens when the result of the multiplication is too large to be stored in the data type. To avoid this, we need to use a data type that is large enough to store the result of the multiplication.

**4. Not handling negative numbers correctly**

The problem statement does not specify whether the input numbers can be negative. If they can be negative, then we need to take care to handle them correctly.

**5. Not handling floating-point numbers correctly**

The problem statement specifies that the input numbers are integers. However, it is possible for the user to enter floating-point numbers. If they do, then we need to convert them to integers before comparing them.

**6. Not handling invalid input correctly**

The problem statement does not specify what should happen if the user enters invalid input. We need to handle this case gracefully by printing an error message and exiting the program.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correct. For example, the output may contain a number instead of a string, or it may contain a string that is not the correct answer. The developer should check the output format and handle any errors appropriately.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program. For example, the developer may not account for all possible cases, or the developer may use incorrect mathematical operations. The developer should carefully check the logic of the program and make sure that it is correct.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer may create memory leaks in the program. A memory leak occurs when the program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing. The developer should use tools to find and fix memory leaks.
5. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer may introduce security vulnerabilities in the program. A security vulnerability is a weakness in the program that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system. The developer should use secure coding practices to avoid security vulnerabilities.
6. **Performance issues**. The developer may create performance issues in the program. A performance issue occurs when the program runs slowly or uses too much resources. The developer should use profiling tools to identify and fix performance issues.

2. **Incorrect implementation**. The developer may incorrectly implement the logic, leading to bugs. For example, they may incorrectly calculate the number of special numbers between X and Y.
3. **Incorrect test cases**. The developer may not test their code with a comprehensive set of test cases, leading to bugs that are not caught until the code is deployed in production. For example, they may not test their code with negative numbers or numbers that are not divisible by ZZ*.
4. **Incorrect runtime**. The developer may not optimize their code, leading to a slow runtime. For example, they may use a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem.
5. **Incorrect memory usage**. The developer may not use their memory efficiently, leading to a high memory usage. For example, they may create a large array to store the results of their calculations.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully read the problem statement and understand the problem before starting to implement a solution. They should also test their code with a comprehensive set of test cases and optimize their code for performance and memory usage.

Title:
HACKEREARTH kejal-color-problem

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the counting algorithm.** The naive algorithm for counting the number of intersections between arcs with different colors would be to iterate over all pairs of arcs and check if they intersect. However, this algorithm has a time complexity of O(N^2), which is too slow for large values of N. A more efficient algorithm is to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.
2. **Incorrect handling of overflows.** When computing the number of intersections, it is important to take care to avoid overflows. This can be done by using the bitwise AND operator (^) to ensure that the results are always less than 10^9 + 7.
3. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic.** When computing the number of intersections, it is important to use modulo arithmetic to ensure that the results are always between 0 and 10^9 + 7. This can be done by using the modulo operator (%).
4. **Incorrect input handling.** The input for this problem is a list of integers. It is important to make sure that the input is valid and that all of the integers are within the specified range.
5. **Incorrect output formatting.** The output for this problem should be a single integer. It is important to make sure that the output is formatted correctly and that it is within the specified range.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design and implement your solution. You should also test your solution thoroughly to make sure that it is correct.

Title:
HACKEREARTH mobile-conversations

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The problem states that the input will be two space-separated integers, but the code below assumes that the input will be a string. This will cause the code to fail when it tries to convert the input to an integer.
2. **Incorrect calculation.** The code below calculates the minimum required initial balance by adding up the call durations and the recharge amounts for each relative. However, this calculation does not take into account the fact that the recharge amounts may be negative. This can cause the code to output an incorrect answer.
3. **Off-by-one error.** The code below starts the loop at index 1, but the problem states that the input will start at index 0. This will cause the code to skip the first relative, which could result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Infinite loop.** The code below does not have any way to exit the loop, so it will run forever if there is no input. This could cause the program to crash or freeze.
5. **Memory leak.** The code below does not free up the memory that it allocates for the input, so the program will eventually run out of memory. This could cause the program to crash or freeze.

To avoid these problems, the following changes can be made to the code:

1. The input should be read as a list of integers, rather than a string. This can be done using the `list()` function.
2. The minimum required initial balance should be calculated by subtracting the call durations from the recharge amounts for each relative. This will ensure that the balance is never negative.
3. The loop should start at index 0, to account for the fact that the input starts at index 0.
4. The loop should be terminated when the end of the input is reached. This can be done using the `len()` function.
5. The memory that is allocated for the input should be freed up when the loop is terminated. This can be done using the `del()` function.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specified in the problem statement is not followed correctly. For example, if the input is `1 2 3`, the program should raise an error.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specified in the problem statement is not followed correctly. For example, if the output is `123`, the program should raise an error.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of real roots.** The program may incorrectly calculate the number of real roots of a quadratic equation. For example, if the equation is `x^2 + 1 = 0`, the program should return `1`, but it may return `2`.
4. **Incorrect handling of errors.** The program may not handle errors correctly. For example, if the input is invalid, the program should raise an error, but it may crash.
5. **Inefficient algorithm.** The program may use an inefficient algorithm to calculate the number of real roots of a quadratic equation. For example, it may use a brute-force algorithm, which is very slow.
6. **Memory leaks.** The program may leak memory. This can cause the program to crash or run out of memory.
7. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program may have security vulnerabilities. For example, it may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system.

Title:
HACKEREARTH stock-market-calculation-1

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input is "3\n3\n5 3 2", the program will expect the next line to be "3", but it is actually "5 3 2". This will cause the program to crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to output incorrect results. For example, if the output is "3\n3\n5 3 2\n0", the program should output "0", but it actually outputs "3". This is because the program is expecting the output to be a single integer, but it is actually a string.

**3. Incorrect calculation**

The program may incorrectly calculate the maximum profit. For example, if the input is "3\n3\n5 3 2", the program may incorrectly calculate the maximum profit as 3, when it should actually be 0. This is because the program is not taking into account the fact that the share price never rises.

**4. Runtime error**

The program may run into a runtime error. For example, if the input is "100000\n100000", the program may run out of memory. This is because the program is trying to store a very large number of values.

**5. Logical error**

The program may contain a logical error. For example, the program may incorrectly assume that the share price will always increase. This can lead to the program incorrectly calculating the maximum profit.

Title:
HACKEREARTH unique

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the input or output.** For example, if the input is a list of integers, but the developer stores it as a list of strings, they will get incorrect results.
2. **Using the wrong algorithm.** For example, if the problem requires finding the maximum value in a list, but the developer uses a linear search algorithm, they will get incorrect results.
3. **Not handling edge cases correctly.** For example, if the problem requires finding the number of elements in a list that are greater than a certain value, but the developer does not handle the case where the list is empty, they will get incorrect results.
4. **Using incorrect variable names.** This can make the code difficult to read and understand, and it can also lead to errors.
5. **Not commenting the code.** This makes it difficult for other developers to understand what the code is doing, and it can also lead to errors.

Title:
ATCODER p02588 AtCoder Grand Contest 047 - Integer Product

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.** When comparing floating-point numbers, it is important to use the `<=` and `>=` operators instead of the `==` operator, as the latter will not always return the correct result. For example, the following code will return `True` even though `a` and `b` are not equal:

```
a = 0.1
b = 0.1
print(a == b)
```

The correct way to compare floating-point numbers is to use the following code:

```
a = 0.1
b = 0.1
print(abs(a - b) <= 1e-10)
```

2. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over a list of numbers, it is important to make sure that you start at the correct index. For example, the following code will not print all of the numbers in the list:

```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for i in range(len(numbers)):
    print(numbers[i])
```

The correct way to iterate over a list is to use the following code:

```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for i in range(1, len(numbers) + 1):
    print(numbers[i - 1])
```

3. **Indexing errors.** When indexing into a list, it is important to make sure that the index is within the bounds of the list. For example, the following code will cause a `IndexError`:

```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers[5])
```

The correct way to index into a list is to make sure that the index is less than the length of the list. For example, the following code will not cause an error:

```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers[4])

Title:
ATCODER p02719 AtCoder Beginner Contest 161 - Replacing Integer

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input constraints are 0 ≤ N ≤ 10^{18} and 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^{18}. If we use an integer data type to store N and K, we may get an overflow error. To avoid this, we can use a long long data type.

**2. Not considering the case where N == K**

The problem statement says that "Find the minimum possible value taken by N after Aoki does the operation zero or more times". So we need to consider the case where N == K. In this case, the minimum possible value is N itself.

**3. Using the wrong formula**

The formula for finding the minimum possible value of N is |N - K|. However, some developers may mistakenly use the formula |N + K|. This will give the wrong answer.

**4. Not handling negative numbers correctly**

The problem statement does not specify whether N and K can be negative. If they are negative, we need to handle them correctly. We can do this by adding a positive constant to both N and K before we perform the operation.

**5. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The most efficient algorithm for solving this problem is to use binary search. We can first find the midpoint of the range [0, N]. Then, we can check if the minimum possible value of N is in the left half or the right half. We can repeat this process until we find the minimum possible value of N.

Title:
ATCODER p02848 AtCoder Beginner Contest 146 - ROT N

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly shifting the characters by N.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. They often forget to take into account the fact that `A` follows `Z` in the alphabet, so they end up shifting the characters by the wrong amount.
2. **Using an incorrect character set.** The problem states that the input string consists of uppercase English letters, so it is important to use the correct character set when reading the input. If you use a different character set, you may end up getting incorrect results.
3. **Not handling invalid input correctly.** The problem states that the input integer N must be between 0 and 26, inclusive. If you do not handle invalid input correctly, your program may crash or produce incorrect results.
4. **Not using a consistent coding style.** Your code should be easy to read and understand, so it is important to use a consistent coding style. This will make it easier for other developers to read and understand your code, and it will also help you to avoid bugs.
5. **Not testing your code thoroughly.** It is important to test your code thoroughly before you deploy it to production. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed, and it will also help you to ensure that your code is working correctly.
Test inputs:
**Incorrectly shifting the characters by N:**

```

ATCODER p02986 AtCoder Beginner Contest 133 - Colorful Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Union-Find data structure.** The Union-Find data structure is a fundamental data structure in graph theory, and it is used to solve a variety of problems, including the one in this question. However, if the implementation of the Union-Find data structure is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect handling of queries.** The queries in this problem are not all independent of each other. For example, if a query changes the length of an edge, then this will affect the distance between two vertices in subsequent queries. Therefore, it is important to handle queries in the correct order.
3. **Incorrect calculation of distances.** The distance between two vertices in a tree can be calculated using the following formula:

```
d(u, v) = d(u, root) + d(v, root) - 2 * d(root, lca(u, v))
```

where `d(u, v)` is the distance between vertices `u` and `v`, `d(u, root)` is the distance from `u` to the root of the tree, `d(v, root)` is the distance from `v` to the root of the tree, and `lca(u, v)` is the lowest common ancestor of `u` and `v`. If the calculation of distances is incorrect, it will lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect input handling.** The input for this problem is not always formatted correctly. For example, the input may contain duplicate edges or edges that do not form a tree. If the input is not handled correctly, it can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect output handling.** The output for this problem must be formatted correctly. For example, the output must be a list of integers, and each integer must be separated by a newline character. If the output is not formatted correctly, it will be rejected by the judge.

2. **Incorrect input validation.** The input is not validated correctly. This could result in the program crashing or returning an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect output formatting.** The output is not formatted correctly. This could make it difficult to understand the results of the program.
4. **Memory leaks.** The program may not release memory that it is no longer using. This could eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
5. **Race conditions.** The program may not be thread-safe. This could result in incorrect results being returned if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.
6. **Deadlocks.** The program may deadlock if two or more threads are waiting for each other to finish. This could prevent the program from making any progress.

**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input N can be very large, so it's important to use the correct data type to store it. If you use a data type that is too small, you may get an overflow error.

**2. Not considering the carryover from one digit to the next**

When adding the digits of a number, you need to take into account the carryover from one digit to the next. For example, if you add the digits 3 and 4, you get 7, but you also need to add the carryover of 1 from the 3.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

There are many different algorithms that you can use to solve this problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others, so it's important to choose the right one for your particular situation.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

It's important to test your code with edge cases to make sure that it handles them correctly. For example, what happens if N is negative? What happens if N is 0?

**5. Not using a debugger**

ATCODER p03743 AtCoder Regular Contest 072 - Alice in linear land

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect variable type**

The input format specifies that `N` and `D` are integers, but the code below incorrectly defines them as floats. This will cause the program to crash when it tries to perform integer arithmetic on them.

```
N = float(input())
D = float(input())
```

**2. Incorrect variable initialization**

The code below incorrectly initializes the `dist` variable to `0`. This is because the distance between Alice and her destination is initially `D`, not `0`.

```
dist = 0
```

**3. Incorrect logic**

The code below incorrectly checks whether Alice will reach her destination after `N` moves. It does this by comparing the sum of the `d` values to `D`, but this is not correct because the `d` values are not necessarily positive.

```
if sum(d) >= D:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

**4. Missing error handling**

The code below does not handle the case where the input is invalid. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

```

    q = list(map(int, input().split()))
except ValueError:
    print('ERROR')
```

**5. Inefficient algorithm**

The code below uses a brute-force algorithm to check whether each plan is feasible. This algorithm is very inefficient, as it requires iterating over all of the `d` values for each plan. A more efficient algorithm would be to use dynamic programming.

AIZU p00009 Prime Number

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly checking if a number is prime.** A common mistake is to check if a number is divisible by only 2 and itself. However, this is not sufficient, as a number can also be divisible by other prime numbers, such as 3 or 5. To correctly check if a number is prime, you need to check if it is divisible by all prime numbers up to its square root.
2. **Using an inefficient algorithm to find prime numbers.** The most naive way to find all prime numbers up to a given number is to simply check each number individually. However, this is very inefficient, as the number of prime numbers grows exponentially with the number of digits. A more efficient algorithm is the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which can be used to find all prime numbers up to a given number in O(n log log n) time.
3. **Not handling input errors correctly.** The input for this problem can contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers greater than 999,999. It is important to check for these errors and handle them appropriately, such as by printing an error message or exiting the program.
4. **Not formatting the output correctly.** The output for this problem should be a single integer, which represents the number of prime numbers less than or equal to the input number. It is important to make sure that the output is formatted correctly, such as by using the `printf()` function in C.

Title:
AIZU p01331 Warp Hall

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrectly calculating the number of warp holes.** The input format specifies that the first line of each test case contains three integers: N, M, and K, where N and M are the coordinates of the target location and K is the number of warp holes. A common mistake is to forget to subtract 1 from N and M when calculating the number of warp holes, which will result in an incorrect answer.
* **Incorrectly handling warp holes that overlap.** The input format specifies that the coordinates of the entrance and exit of each warp hole must be distinct. However, it is possible for two warp holes to have the same entrance or exit. A common mistake is to incorrectly handle these cases, which can lead to incorrect results.
* **Incorrectly handling warp holes that are connected in a cycle.** It is possible for two or more warp holes to be connected in a cycle, such that a particle can enter one warp hole and exit another warp hole without ever reaching the target location. A common mistake is to incorrectly handle these cases, which can lead to incorrect results.
* **Incorrectly handling warp holes that are connected to the target location.** It is possible for a warp hole to be connected to the target location, such that a particle can enter the warp hole and immediately reach the target location. A common mistake is to incorrectly handle these cases, which can lead to incorrect results.
* **Incorrectly handling warp holes that are connected to each other in multiple ways.** It is possible for two or more warp holes to be connected to each other in multiple ways. A common mistake is to incorrectly handle these cases, which can lead to incorrect results.
* **Incorrectly handling warp holes that are connected to each other in a complex way.** It is possible for two or more warp holes to be connected to each other in a complex way, such that a particle can enter one warp hole and exit another warp hole in multiple different ways. A common mistake is to incorrectly handle these cases, which can lead to incorrect results.

**Additional tips:**

* When debugging your code, it is helpful to use a debugger to step through your code line by line and watch the values of your variables change. This can help you identify errors in your logic.
* When you are not sure how to solve a problem, it is helpful to break the problem down into smaller subproblems. This can make the problem more manageable and easier to solve.
* It is also helpful to look at the solutions of other people. This can give you new ideas and help you to understand the problem better.

Title:
AIZU p01811 ABC Gene

Pain points:
**1. The input string may not contain any of the characters 'A', 'B', or 'C'.**

This can be caught by adding a simple check at the beginning of the program to verify that the input string only contains these characters.

**2. The input string may be longer than 5,000 characters.**

This can be caught by adding a check at the beginning of the program to verify that the length of the input string is less than or equal to 5,000.

**3. The input string may not be a valid gene sequence.**

A valid gene sequence must consist of only the characters 'A', 'B', and 'C', and it must not contain any duplicate characters. This can be checked by iterating through the input string and verifying that each character is a valid character and that there are no duplicate characters.

**4. The program may not output the correct answer.**

This can be caused by a number of errors, such as a logic error in the program, a runtime error, or a problem with the input data. It is important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it outputs the correct answer for all valid inputs.

**5. The program may run too slowly.**

This can be caused by a number of factors, such as a inefficient algorithm, a large input size, or a slow computer. It is important to optimize the program to run as quickly as possible.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the integers may not be separated by spaces.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may not be in the correct data type. For example, the weight may be a string instead of an integer.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The developer may make a mistake in the calculation of the weight on the next day. For example, the developer may forget to add the weight change to the current weight.
4. **Infinite loop**. The developer may create an infinite loop in the code. For example, the developer may use a while loop without a condition that will eventually terminate the loop.
5. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may make a mistake in the calculation of the number of days. For example, the developer may count the number of days from the first day of the plan instead of the zeroth day.

Title:
AIZU p02095 Colorful Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The input graph is a tree, so we can use a [disjoint set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure) data structure to represent it. This will allow us to quickly find the root of any vertex in the tree, as well as the set of vertices that are connected to it.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for finding the maximum colorfulness of a rooted subtree is relatively straightforward. We can start at the root of the tree and recursively find the maximum colorfulness of each of its subtrees. The maximum colorfulness of the entire tree is then the maximum of the colorfulness of all of its subtrees.
3. **Incorrect handling of errors.** The input to this problem is guaranteed to be valid, so we don't need to worry about handling errors.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The output of this problem should be a list of integers, one for each vertex in the tree. Each integer should represent the maximum colorfulness of the rooted subtree of the tree whose root is the corresponding vertex.
5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other potential bugs that could be encountered when solving this problem, such as using the wrong data types, forgetting to initialize variables, or making logical errors in the code.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly.

Title:
AIZU p02233 Fibonacci Number

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect base case**

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

```
fib(0) = 1
fib(1) = 1
fib(n) = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2) for n > 1
```

So, the base cases are fib(0) = 1 and fib(1) = 1. If you use an incorrect base case, such as fib(0) = 0, your program will not produce the correct Fibonacci numbers.

**2. Using an incorrect recursive function call**

The Fibonacci sequence is a recursive sequence, so your program must use a recursive function to calculate the Fibonacci numbers. If you use an incorrect recursive function call, your program will not produce the correct Fibonacci numbers.

**3. Not handling negative values of n correctly**

The Fibonacci sequence is only defined for non-negative values of n. If you try to calculate the Fibonacci number for a negative value of n, your program will throw an error.

**4. Using an inefficient algorithm**

The Fibonacci sequence can be calculated using a variety of algorithms. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. If you use an inefficient algorithm, your program will run slowly.

**5. Not handling overflow correctly**

The Fibonacci numbers can grow very large very quickly. If you do not handle overflow correctly, your program may crash or produce incorrect results.

**6. Not handling floating-point errors correctly**

The Fibonacci numbers are irrational numbers, so they cannot be represented exactly in floating-point arithmetic. If you do not handle floating-point errors correctly, your program may produce incorrect results.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect calculation of distance**. The most common mistake is to use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the distance between two points, when in fact the distance is the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between the x- and y-coordinates of the two points.
2. **Incorrect typecasting**. When converting the input from a string to a number, it is important to make sure that the number is correctly interpreted. For example, if the input is "1.23", the number should be converted to 1.23, not 123.
3. **Incorrect rounding**. When printing the output, it is important to make sure that the output is rounded to the correct number of decimal places. For example, if the distance is 1.41421356, the output should be 1.41421, not 1.414214.
4. **Incorrect error handling**. If the input is invalid, the program should handle the error gracefully and print an appropriate error message. For example, if the input is not a number, the program should print an error message and exit.
