CODECHEF cd1it1

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one errors.** When finding the middle element of an array, it is important to make sure that you are not counting the first or last element twice. This can be avoided by using the following formula:

```
median = (N + 1) / 2
```

2. **Sorting errors.** When sorting an array, it is important to make sure that the array is actually sorted in ascending order. This can be done by using a sorting algorithm such as quicksort or merge sort.

3. **Indexing errors.** When accessing elements of an array, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct index. This can be avoided by using the following formula:

```
index = (i - 1) // 2
```

4. **Data type errors.** When working with arrays, it is important to make sure that the data types of the elements are compatible. For example, you cannot add an integer to a float.

5. **Boundary errors.** When working with arrays, it is important to make sure that you do not access elements that are outside of the bounds of the array. This can be avoided by using the following formula:

```
index < len(array)
```

Title:
CODECHEF hotel

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly using the arrival and departure times.** The arrival time is the time the guest checks in, and the departure time is the time the guest checks out. It is important to use the correct time for each guest, or the maximum number of guests will be incorrect.
2. **Not considering guests who arrive at the same time.** If two guests arrive at the same time, they are considered to be at the hotel simultaneously. This means that the maximum number of guests must be at least as large as the number of guests who arrive at the same time.
3. **Not considering guests who leave at the same time.** If two guests leave at the same time, they are no longer considered to be at the hotel. This means that the maximum number of guests must be decreased by the number of guests who leave at the same time.
4. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others, and some algorithms are more prone to errors. It is important to choose an algorithm that is both efficient and accurate.
5. **Incorrectly implementing the algorithm.** Even if the correct algorithm is chosen, it is still possible to implement the algorithm incorrectly. This can lead to errors in the output, such as the maximum number of guests being incorrect. It is important to carefully implement the algorithm to avoid these errors.

Pain points:
In the second test we have the following sequence: 98.99, 98.09, 0.99. After last step we have not enough money for further transformations. The maximal profit will be after 0 transformations. 1. The input format is not very clear. It is not clear what the meaning of the "A, B, C" variables are.
2. The problem statement does not specify what happens if you try to put more cents in the machine than you have.
3. The problem statement does not specify what happens if you try to throw away some money before putting it in the machine.
4. The problem statement does not specify what happens if you run out of money.
5. The problem statement does not specify how to calculate the maximum profit.

Title:
CODECHEF resn04

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem states that "Alice and Bob play alternately, with Alice starting". This means that Alice makes the first move, and then Bob makes the second move, and so on. A common mistake is to assume that Alice and Bob make their moves simultaneously.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the game rules.** The game rules state that "In a turn, the player chooses any pile i which has atleast i stones in it, and removes exactly i stones from it". This means that a player can only remove stones from a pile if the pile has at least as many stones as the player's turn number. A common mistake is to allow players to remove stones from any pile, regardless of the number of stones in the pile.
3. **Incorrect handling of ties.** The problem states that "The game ends when there is no such pile". This means that the game ends when there is no pile that has at least as many stones as the current player's turn number. A common mistake is to declare the game a tie when there is no such pile, even if one of the players has more stones than the other player.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The problem states that "Output T lines, one per test case". This means that the output should contain one line for each test case. A common mistake is to output multiple lines for a single test case, or to output a single line for multiple test cases.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The problem does not specify what should happen if there is an error in the input. A common mistake is to ignore errors, or to output an incorrect answer.

Title:
CODECHEF twofrnds

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of `if` statement.** The `if` statement should be used to check if a condition is true, and then execute the code block if it is. In the following code, the `if` statement is used to check if the variable `n` is equal to `1`, and then the code block is executed if it is not. This is incorrect, because the `if` statement should be used to check if the variable `n` is equal to `1`, and then the code block should be executed if it is.

```
if (n != 1) {
  // Code block to be executed if n is not equal to 1
}
```

2. **Incorrect use of `else` statement.** The `else` statement should be used to execute code if the condition in the `if` statement is not true. In the following code, the `else` statement is used to execute code if the variable `n` is equal to `1`, which is the same condition as the `if` statement. This is incorrect, because the `else` statement should only be used to execute code if the condition in the `if` statement is not true.

```
if (n == 1) {
  // Code block to be executed if n is equal to 1
} else {
  // Code block to be executed if n is not equal to 1
}
```

3. **Incorrect use of `&&` operator.** The `&&` operator is used to check if two conditions are both true. In the following code, the `&&` operator is used to check if the variable `n` is equal to `1` and the variable `m` is equal to `2`, which is not possible. This is incorrect, because the `&&` operator should only be used to check if two conditions are both true.

```
if (n == 1 && m == 2) {
  // Code block to be executed if n is equal to 1 and m is equal to 2
}
```

4. **Incorrect use of `||` operator.** The `||` operator is used to check if either of two conditions is true. In the following code, the `||` operator is used to check if the variable `n` is equal to `1` or the variable `m` is equal to `2`, which is not possible. This is incorrect, because the `||` operator should only be used to check if either of two conditions is true.

```
if (n == 1 || m == 2) {
  // Code block to be executed if n is equal to 1 or m is equal to 2
}

Title:
CODEFORCES 1017_F. The Neutral Zone

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect implementation of the exlog_f function.** This could lead to incorrect results, as the function is used to calculate the sum of exlog_f values for all integers from 1 to n.
* **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** This could lead to incorrect results, as the sum of exlog_f values can be very large and overflow the 32-bit integer type.
* **Incorrect handling of negative integers.** The exlog_f function is only defined for positive integers, so any negative integers in the input should be ignored.
* **Incorrect handling of zero.** The exlog_f function is undefined for zero, so any zeros in the input should be ignored.
* **Incorrect handling of prime numbers.** The exlog_f function is only defined for polynomials of degree no more than 3, so any prime numbers in the input should be ignored.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements of the task. It is also important to test your code thoroughly to ensure that it produces the correct results.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of coffee breaks is not a positive integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values must be correct. For example, if the number of coffee breaks is a string, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The program must correctly calculate the minimum number of days required to take all the coffee breaks. For example, if the minimum number of days is not a whole number, the program will give an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format must be correct. For example, if the days of the coffee breaks are not printed in the correct order, the program will not be accepted.
5. **Other bugs**. There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the program may not handle special cases correctly, or it may crash due to a memory leak.

CODEFORCES 1085_G. Beautiful Matrix

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specified in the problem statement is not followed. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, or if the input contains a row that does not contain exactly n integers, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specified in the problem statement is not followed. For example, if the output contains a number that is not an integer, or if the output is not a single integer, the program will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the rarity.** The rarity of a matrix is calculated by counting the number of matrices that are lexicographically smaller than the given matrix. This calculation can be done incorrectly if the program does not properly compare two matrices or if the program does not correctly account for the fact that some matrices are equivalent to each other.
4. **Incorrect modulo operation.** The rarity of a matrix is a number modulo 998244353. This means that the program must perform the modulo operation correctly. If the program does not perform the modulo operation correctly, the output will be incorrect.
5. **Other bugs.** There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the program may crash due to a memory leak, or it may not terminate within the time limit.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1105_E. Helping Hiasat 

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrectly handling the input format.** The input format for this problem is a bit tricky, so it's important to make sure that you understand it correctly. The first line contains two integers `n` and `m`, which represent the number of events and the number of friends, respectively. The next `n` lines each contain a single event, which is either `1` (indicating that Hiasat can change his handle) or `2 s` (indicating that friend `s` visits Hiasat's profile).
2. **Not considering all possible scenarios.** When trying to find the maximum number of happy friends, it's important to consider all possible scenarios. For example, in the first example, it's possible to change the handle to `motarack` in the first event and to `light` in the fourth event, which would make both `motarack` and `light` happy.
3. **Making a mistake in your implementation.** This is always a possibility, so it's important to carefully check your code for errors. Some common mistakes to watch out for include typos, incorrect logic, and off-by-one errors.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrectly handling the input format.** One common mistake is to incorrectly handle the input format. For example, you might accidentally read the first line as `n m` instead of `n m`, which would cause you to incorrectly calculate the number of events and the number of friends.
2. **Not considering all possible scenarios.** Another common mistake is to not consider all possible scenarios. For example, in the first example, you might only consider the scenario where Hiasat changes his handle to `motarack` in the first event and to `light` in the fourth event, which would make both `motarack` and `light` happy. However, you should also consider the scenario where Hiasat changes his handle to `light` in the first event and to `motarack` in the fourth event, which would only make `light` happy.
3. **Making a mistake in your implementation.** Finally, you might make a mistake in your implementation. For example, you might accidentally use the wrong variable to store the number of happy friends, or you might incorrectly calculate the number of happy friends.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1133_A. Middle of the Contest

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data is given in the format hh:mm, so we need to use strings to store it. However, some developers may accidentally use integers to store the input data, which will lead to incorrect results.

**2. Not handling the case where the contest starts and ends at the same time**

The problem statement states that the contest lasts an even number of minutes, so the midpoint of the contest must be between the start and end times. However, some developers may not handle this case correctly, and their code will crash if the contest starts and ends at the same time.

**3. Not handling the case where the contest lasts for more than 24 hours**

The problem statement states that the contest lasts during a single day, so the midpoint of the contest must be within the same day. However, some developers may not handle this case correctly, and their code will return an incorrect answer if the contest lasts for more than 24 hours.

**4. Not handling the case where the contest starts and ends at midnight**

The problem statement does not explicitly state what to do in the case where the contest starts and ends at midnight. However, it is reasonable to assume that the midpoint of the contest should be at midnight. Some developers may not handle this case correctly, and their code will return an incorrect answer if the contest starts and ends at midnight.

**5. Not handling the case where the contest starts and ends at noon**

The problem statement does not explicitly state what to do in the case where the contest starts and ends at noon. However, it is reasonable to assume that the midpoint of the contest should be at noon. Some developers may not handle this case correctly, and their code will return an incorrect answer if the contest starts and ends at noon.

**6. Not handling the case where the contest starts and ends at 12:00 AM**

The problem statement does not explicitly state what to do in the case where the contest starts and ends at 12:00 AM. However, it is reasonable to assume that the midpoint of the contest should be at 12:00 AM. Some developers may not handle this case correctly, and their code will return an incorrect answer if the contest starts and ends at 12:00 AM.

Pain points:
```
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format of the problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, you might accidentally read the number of points as a number of queries, or you might forget to read the second line of each query.
2. **Incorrect calculation of f_k(x).** The function f_k(x) is defined as the k+1th smallest distance between a point and x. However, it's easy to make a mistake when calculating this distance. For example, you might accidentally calculate the distance between a point and x-1 instead of x.
3. **Incorrect sorting of the distances.** The distances must be sorted in non-descending order before taking the k+1th smallest distance. However, it's easy to make a mistake when sorting the distances. For example, you might accidentally sort the distances in descending order.
4. **Incorrect output.** The output must be a list of integers, each of which is the x-coordinate of a point that minimizes f_k(x). However, it's easy to make a mistake when printing the output. For example, you might accidentally print the y-coordinate of a point instead of the x-coordinate.
5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem. For example, you might accidentally use the wrong data type for a variable, or you might forget to initialize a variable.

CODEFORCES 1194_B. Yet Another Crosses Problem

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrectly counting the number of minutes needed to paint a cross.** This is a common mistake that can be easily avoided by carefully tracking the number of minutes spent painting each cell.
2. **Not considering all possible crosses.** When finding the minimum number of minutes needed to paint a cross, it is important to consider all possible crosses, even if they seem unlikely.
3. **Using incorrect data structures.** The data structures used to store the picture and the crosses can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. It is important to choose data structures that are well-suited for the problem at hand.
4. **Implementing the algorithm incorrectly.** The algorithm for finding the minimum number of minutes needed to paint a cross is relatively simple, but it is important to implement it correctly in order to avoid bugs.
5. **Not testing the code thoroughly.** It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and works as expected. This can be done by writing unit tests and integration tests.

CODEFORCES 1210_F2. Marek and Matching (hard version)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is specified in the problem statement. Make sure that your code correctly parses the input.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also specified in the problem statement. Make sure that your code correctly formats the output.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the probability**. The probability of a perfect matching can be calculated using the following formula:

```
P = (1/2)^n * prod(1 - (1 - p)^2)
```

where n is the number of vertices in the graph and p is the probability of an edge appearing in the graph. Make sure that your code correctly calculates this formula.
4. **Modular arithmetic errors**. The problem requires you to print the probability of a perfect matching modulo 10^9+7. Make sure that your code correctly performs modular arithmetic.
5. **Off-by-one errors**. Be careful when counting the number of graphs or perfect matchings. It is easy to make a mistake and get the wrong answer.
6. **Runtime errors**. Make sure that your code runs within the time limit specified in the problem statement.
7. **Memory errors**. Make sure that your code does not run out of memory.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1231_E. Middle-Out

Pain points:
 * **Problem 1: Incorrectly counting the number of moves.**

One common mistake is to incorrectly count the number of moves required to transform s into t. For example, consider the following test case:

```
n = 3
s = "abc"
t = "cba"
```

A naive solution might count the number of moves as follows:

```
moves = 0
for i in range(n):
    if s[i] != t[i]:
        moves += 1
```

However, this solution is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the moves can be applied in any order. In this case, we can actually reduce the number of moves to 1 by moving the first character of s to the end, then moving the second character of s to the beginning.

The correct solution is:

```
moves = 0
for i in range(n):
    if s[i] != t[n - i - 1]:
        moves += 1
```

**Problem 2: Not considering all possible cases.**

Another common mistake is to not consider all possible cases. For example, consider the following test case:

```
n = 3
s = "abc"
t = "acb"
```

A naive solution might simply check if s and t are equal, and return -1 if they are not. However, this solution is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that s and t may be equal after applying a single move. In this case, we can reduce the number of moves to 0 by moving the first character of s to the end.

The correct solution is:

```
if s == t:
    return 0
else:
    return -1
```

**Problem 3: Using inefficient data structures.**

Another common mistake is to use inefficient data structures. For example, consider the following solution to the problem:

```
def solve(n, s, t):
    # Create a dictionary to map each character in s to its position.
    char_to_pos = {}
    for i in range(n):
        char_to_pos[s[i]] = i

    # Create a queue to store the characters in t.
    q = []
    for i in range(n):
        q.append(t[i])

    # While the queue is not empty, pop the next character from the queue and move it to the beginning of s.
    while q:
        char = q.pop(0)
        pos = char_to_pos[char]
        s = s[:pos] + char + s[pos + 1:]

    # Return the number of moves required to transform s into t.
    return len(set(s) ^ set(t))
```

This solution is inefficient because it uses a dictionary to map each character in s to its position. This dictionary takes O(n) time to create and O(1) time to access. A more efficient solution would be to use a hash table to map each character in s to its position. This hash table would take O(n) time to create and O(1) time to access.

**Problem 4: Using incorrect algorithms.**

Another common mistake is to use incorrect algorithms. For example, consider the following solution to the problem:

```
def solve(n, s, t):
    # Create a graph where each node represents a character in s.
    graph = {}
    for i in range(n):
        graph[s[i]] = []

    # Add an edge from each character in s to each character in t.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if s[i] != t[j]:
                graph[s[i]].append(t[j])

    # Find the shortest path from the first character in s to the last character in t.
    path = bfs(graph, s[0], t[-1])

    # Return the number of edges in the path.
    return len(path)
```

This solution is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the moves can be applied in any order. In this case, we can actually reduce

Title:
CODEFORCES 1252_H. Twin Buildings

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is specified as follows:

```
Input begins with a line containing an integer: N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100 000) representing the number of available lands. The next N lines each contains two integers: L_i W_i (1 ≤ L_i, W_i ≤ 10^9) representing the size of the land.
```

A common mistake that developers make is to not follow the specified input format. For example, the following input is incorrect:

```
2
5 5
3 4
```

The correct input should be:

```
2
5 5
3 4
```

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is specified as follows:

```
Output in a line a number representing the largest building that ICPC Jakarta can build with exactly one decimal point (see sample input/output for clarity).
```

A common mistake that developers make is to not follow the specified output format. For example, the following output is incorrect:

```
12.5
```

The correct output should be:

```
12.50
```

**3. Using incorrect data types**

The problem states that the input consists of integers. A common mistake that developers make is to use the wrong data type to store the input values. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
n = int(input())
lands = []
for _ in range(n):
    l, w = map(int, input().split())
    lands.append((l, w))
```

The problem is that the `map` function returns a list of tuples, but the `lands` list is expecting a list of integers. To fix this, we can use the following code:

```
n = int(input())
lands = []
for _ in range(n):
    l, w = map(int, input().split())
    lands.append(l * w)
```

**4. Not using the correct data structures**

The problem states that the output should be a number. A common mistake that developers make is to use the wrong data structure to store the output value. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
n = int(input())
lands = []
for _ in range(n):
    l, w = map(int, input().split())
    lands.append((l, w))

largest = 0
for l, w in lands:
    if l * w > largest:
        largest = l * w

print(largest)
```

The problem is that the `largest` variable is a list, but the output should be a number. To fix this, we can use the following code:

```
n = int(input())
lands = []
for _ in range(n):
    l, w = map(int, input().split())
    lands.append((l, w))

largest = 0
for l, w in lands:
    if l * w > largest:
        largest = l * w

print(largest)
```

**5. Not handling edge cases**

The problem states that the input consists of integers. A common mistake that developers make is to not handle edge cases, such as negative numbers or zero. For example, the following code will not work correctly if the input contains a negative number:

```
n = int(input())
lands = []
for _ in range(n):
    l, w = map(int, input().split())
    lands.append((l, w))

largest = 0
for l, w in lands:
    if l * w > largest:
        largest = l * w

print(largest)
```

To fix this, we can use the following code:

```
n = int(input())
lands = []
for _ in range(n):
    l, w = map(int, input().split())
    if l < 0 or w < 0:
        continue
    lands.append((l, w))

largest = 0
for l, w in lands:
    if l * w > largest:
        largest = l * w

print(largest)
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 1276_A. As Simple as One and Two

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrectly counting the number of occurrences of substrings "one" and "two".** This is a common mistake that can be easily avoided by using a regular expression to find all occurrences of these substrings.
2. **Not considering the case when the string contains multiple occurrences of substrings "one" and "two".** This can be solved by iterating over all occurrences of these substrings and removing the minimum number of characters from each occurrence.
3. **Not handling the case when the string contains no occurrences of substrings "one" and "two".** In this case, the answer is simply 0.
4. **Not printing the output in the correct format.** The output should be two lines: the first line should contain the number of characters to be removed, and the second line should contain the indices of the characters to be removed.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use a regular expression to find all occurrences of substrings "one" and "two".
* Iterate over all occurrences of these substrings and remove the minimum number of characters from each occurrence.
* Handle the case when the string contains no occurrences of substrings "one" and "two" by simply returning 0.
* Print the output in the correct format.

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not specified.** The input format is not specified in the problem statement. This could lead to developers misinterpreting the input format and making mistakes.
2. **The output format is not specified.** The output format is not specified in the problem statement. This could lead to developers misinterpreting the output format and making mistakes.
3. **The problem is not well-defined.** The problem is not well-defined in the problem statement. This could lead to developers making incorrect assumptions about the problem and coming up with incorrect solutions.
4. **The problem is too difficult.** The problem is too difficult for most developers to solve. This could lead to developers giving up on the problem and not learning anything.
5. **The problem is too easy.** The problem is too easy for most developers to solve. This could lead to developers not learning anything new.

Here are some specific bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **The developer may not correctly implement the cashback calculation.** The cashback calculation is a bit tricky, and developers may make mistakes.
2. **The developer may not correctly implement the loop that iterates over the test cases.** The loop that iterates over the test cases is easy to get wrong, and developers may make mistakes.

Title:
CODEFORCES 131_B. Opposites Attract

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is `n t1 t2 ... tn`, where `n` is the number of customers and `ti` is the parameter of the `i`-th customer. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format for this problem is a single integer that represents the number of opposite couples. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not produce the correct answer.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When counting the number of opposite couples, it is important to make sure that you don't double-count any couples. For example, if `t1 = -1` and `t2 = 1`, then `(t1, t2)` and `(t2, t1)` are both opposite couples. To avoid this problem, you can use a set to keep track of the pairs of opposite couples that you have already counted.
4. **Memory errors.** The input data for this problem can be large, so it is important to make sure that your program does not run out of memory. You can use the `cin.tie()` and `cout.tie()` functions to flush the output buffer after each line of output, which will help to improve memory usage.
5. **Time complexity.** The time complexity of your solution should be `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of customers. If your solution has a higher time complexity, it will not be able to solve the problem in time.
6. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm that you use to solve this problem must be correct. If your algorithm is incorrect, the program will not produce the correct answer.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1338_D. Nested Rubber Bands

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The tree traversal algorithm should visit all nodes in the tree in a specific order, such as preorder, postorder, or inorder. If the algorithm is not implemented correctly, it may miss some nodes or visit them in the wrong order, which will result in incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the rubber band nesting algorithm.** The rubber band nesting algorithm should find all pairs of rubber bands that are nested. To do this, the algorithm must first find all edges in the tree. Then, for each edge, it must check if the two rubber bands that are connected by the edge are nested. If they are, the algorithm must add them to the list of nested rubber bands. If the algorithm is not implemented correctly, it may miss some pairs of nested rubber bands, which will result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum length of the nested rubber band sequence.** The maximum length of the nested rubber band sequence is the number of pairs of nested rubber bands. To calculate this, the algorithm must first find all pairs of nested rubber bands. Then, it must add up the number of pairs of nested rubber bands to get the maximum length. If the algorithm is not implemented correctly, it may calculate the maximum length incorrectly.
4. **Incorrect output of the maximum length of the nested rubber band sequence.** The maximum length of the nested rubber band sequence should be printed to the console. If the algorithm is not implemented correctly, it may not print the maximum length to the console, or it may print an incorrect value.
5. **Other errors.** There are a number of other errors that can occur when solving this problem. Some common errors include:
    * Using the wrong data structures or algorithms.
    * Making incorrect assumptions about the input data.
    * Misunderstanding the problem statement.
    * Making a coding error.

By carefully avoiding these common mistakes, you can increase your chances of solving this problem correctly.

CODEFORCES 1400_D. Zigzags

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format of the problem states that the first line should contain a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. However, if the input contains a non-integer value, such as "abc", the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format of the problem states that for each test case, the program should print the number of described tuples. However, if the program prints anything other than an integer, such as "abc", the output will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of tuples.** The problem states that the number of tuples is equal to the number of ways to choose four indices i, j, k, and l such that 1 ≤ i < j < k < l ≤ n and a_i = a_k and a_j = a_l. However, if the program incorrectly calculates the number of tuples, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** The program may incorrectly calculate the number of tuples by counting one or more tuples more than once or by not counting one or more tuples.
5. **Memory leaks.** The program may not properly release memory that it has allocated, which can lead to a memory leak.

CODEFORCES 1495_B. Let's Go Hiking

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem statement is not very clear, so it is important to read it carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked. In particular, it is important to understand the rules of the game and how Qingshan and Daniel can make their moves.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution to this problem involves a lot of tricky details, so it is important to make sure that your implementation is correct. In particular, you need to be careful about the following:
    * The order in which you iterate over the elements of the permutation.
    * The conditions you check when determining whether Qingshan can win.
    * The way you update the permutation after Qingshan and Daniel make their moves.
3. **Incorrect testing of the solution.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. This includes testing it on a variety of different input cases, including cases where Qingshan and Daniel make optimal moves.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** A developer might incorrectly assume that Qingshan can always win the game, even if Daniel makes optimal moves. This is not the case, as shown in the second example test case.
* **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** A developer might incorrectly iterate over the elements of the permutation in the wrong order. This could lead to Qingshan not being able to find a valid move, even if one exists.
* **Incorrect conditions for determining whether Qingshan can win.** A developer might incorrectly check whether Qingshan can win by only looking at the current state of the permutation. This is not enough, as Qingshan also needs to consider the possible moves that Daniel can make in the future.
* **Incorrect way of updating the permutation after Qingshan and Daniel make their moves.** A developer might incorrectly update the permutation in a way that prevents Qingshan from making a valid move in the future.
* **Incorrect testing of the solution.** A developer might not test their solution on a variety of different input cases, including cases where Qingshan and Daniel make optimal moves. This could lead to the developer incorrectly believing that their solution is correct, even if it is not.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correct. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or two numbers are not separated by a space.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correct. For example, the output may contain a non-integer number, or two numbers are not separated by a space.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program is incorrect. For example, the program may not find the maximum sum of the weights of the remaining tents.
4. **Memory leak**. The program may not release the memory that it has allocated. This can lead to a system crash.
5. **Time complexity**. The program may take too long to run. This can be a problem if the input is large.
6. **Incorrect data structure**. The program may use an incorrect data structure to store the data. This can lead to incorrect results.
7. **Incorrect algorithm**. The program may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. This can lead to incorrect results.
8. **Incorrect implementation**. The program may be incorrectly implemented. This can lead to incorrect results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1545_E2. AquaMoon and Time Stop (hard version)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is a string, but the developer may mistakenly treat it as an integer. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect comparison**. The developer may compare two floating-point numbers using the == operator. This is incorrect, as floating-point numbers are not exact values and may have rounding errors. The correct way to compare floating-point numbers is to use the >, <, >=, and <= operators.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer may forget to add or subtract one from a number. This can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Memory leaks**. The developer may not free up memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
6. **Race conditions**. The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data. This can lead to incorrect results or even a deadlock.
7. **Deadlocks**. The developer may create a situation where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can cause the program to deadlock, which means that it will stop responding and will not be able to continue.
8. **Buffer overflows**. The developer may write data to a buffer that is not large enough. This can overwrite neighboring data and lead to security vulnerabilities.
9. **Format string vulnerabilities**. The developer may use a format string that is not properly escaped. This can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the program, which can lead to a security vulnerability.
10. **SQL injection vulnerabilities**. The developer may not properly escape user input when using SQL queries. This can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database, which can lead to a security vulnerability.

Title:
CODEFORCES 172_E. BHTML+BCSS

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrectly parsing the input data.** The input data is a BHTML document and a set of BCSS rules. The BHTML document is a sequence of opening and closing tags. A tag that looks like `<tagname>` is called an opening tag and a tag that looks like `</tagname>` is called a closing tag. Besides, there are self-closing tags that are written as `<tagname/>` and in this problem they are fully equivalent to `<tagname></tagname>`. All tagnames in this problem are strings consisting of lowercase Latin letters with length from 1 to 10 characters. Tagnames of different tags may coincide.

The BCSS rules are a sequence of subsequences of words `x1 x2 ... xn`. Each rule has effect over all such elements t, which satisfy both conditions from the list:

  * there is a sequence of nested elements with tagnames `x1`, `x2`, ..., `xn` (that is, the second element is nested in the first one, the third element is nested in the second one and so on),
  * this sequence ends with element t (i.e. tagname of element t equals `xn`).

If the input data is not parsed correctly, the program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.

* **Incorrectly traversing the BHTML document.** The BHTML document is a sequence of opening and closing tags. To traverse the document, the program must first find the first opening tag, then follow the sequence of opening and closing tags until the end of the document is reached. If the program does not traverse the document correctly, it may miss some elements or count some elements multiple times.

* **Incorrectly identifying nested elements.** To identify nested elements, the program must keep track of the current element and the elements that are nested inside it. If the program does not keep track of the nested elements correctly, it may incorrectly identify the elements that meet the conditions of the BCSS rules.

* **Incorrectly counting the number of elements that meet the conditions of the BCSS rules.** To count the number of elements that meet the conditions of the BCSS rules, the program must iterate over all elements of the BHTML document and check if each element meets the conditions of the rules. If the program does not iterate over all elements of the BHTML document or does not check if each element meets the conditions of the rules correctly, it may incorrectly count the number of elements that meet the conditions of the BCSS rules.

**Some additional tips for solving this problem:**

* Use a stack to keep track of the current element and the elements that are nested inside it.
* Use a hash table to store the number of elements that meet the conditions of each BCSS rule.
* Iterate over all elements of the BHTML document and check if each element meets the conditions of the BCSS rules.
* Print the number of elements that meet the conditions of each BCSS rule.

Title:
CODEFORCES 453_C. Little Pony and Summer Sun Celebration

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be strictly followed. For example, if the number of nodes is not a positive integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format should be strictly followed. For example, if the number of visited places is not a positive integer, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program should find a path that satisfies the given constraints. For example, if the path visits a node more than the required number of times, the program will return an incorrect answer.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program should not allocate more memory than necessary. For example, if the program allocates a large array and does not free it after use, it will eventually run out of memory and crash.
5. **Timeout**. The program should not run for too long. For example, if the program takes more than a few seconds to run, it will be considered a timeout and will receive a negative score.

Title:
CODEFORCES 523_D. Statistics of Recompressing Videos

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input format specifies that the number of videos and servers should be integers. However, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect data format**

The input format specifies that the descriptions of the videos should be pairs of integers. However, if the input contains a single integer or a string instead of a pair of integers, the program will crash.

**3. Undefined behavior**

The program may behave in an undefined way if the input contains invalid data. For example, if the input contains a negative number, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

The program may produce incorrect output if the index of a video is not calculated correctly. For example, if the input contains n videos and the program tries to access the video with index n + 1, the program will crash.

**5. Memory leaks**

The program may leak memory if it does not free the memory that it allocates. This can lead to a decrease in performance and eventually to a crash.

**6. Race conditions**

The program may experience race conditions if it accesses shared data without synchronization. This can lead to incorrect output or even to a crash.

**7. Deadlocks**

The program may deadlock if it enters a situation where it is waiting for a resource that is never released. This can lead to a hang or a crash.

**8. Security vulnerabilities**

The program may be vulnerable to security attacks if it does not properly validate user input. This can allow attackers to gain access to the program's data or to execute arbitrary code.

**9. Incorrect algorithm**

CODEFORCES 61_E. Enemy is weak

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specified in the problem statement is "The first line of input contains a single number n (3 ≤ n ≤ 106) — the number of men in Roman army. Next line contains n different positive integers ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — powers of men in the Roman army.". A developer might incorrectly read the input as "The first line of input contains a single number n (3 ≤ n ≤ 106) — the number of men in Roman army. Next line contains n different positive integers ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — powers of men in the Roman army.". This would cause the program to crash when it tries to read the input.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specified in the problem statement is "A single integer number, the weakness of the Roman army.". A developer might incorrectly output the weakness of the Roman army as a floating-point number. This would cause the program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict.
3. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm used to find the weakness of the Roman army must be correct. A developer might use an incorrect algorithm, which would cause the program to output an incorrect answer.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** The developer might make off-by-one errors when counting the number of triplets i, j, k such that i < j < k and ai > aj > ak. This would cause the program to output an incorrect answer.
5. **Memory leaks.** The developer might not free the memory allocated for the input array or the output array. This would cause the program to leak memory, which could eventually lead to a segmentation fault.
6. **Synchronization errors.** The developer might not synchronize access to shared resources between multiple threads. This could cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
7. **Race conditions.** The developer might not handle race conditions correctly. This could cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
8. **Deadlocks.** The developer might create deadlocks in the program. This could cause the program to hang indefinitely.
9. **Security vulnerabilities.** The developer might introduce security vulnerabilities in the program. This could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or its data.
10. **Other bugs.** There are many other possible bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem. It is important to be aware of these potential problems and to take steps to avoid them.

CODEFORCES 63_D. Dividing Island

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when entering the data. For example, if you forget to put a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format for this problem is also very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if you forget to put a newline character between two lines, the program will not be able to read the output correctly.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. This problem is full of opportunities for off-by-one errors. For example, if you forget to add one to a variable when you're counting the number of squares in a party's territory, the program will think that the party has more territory than it actually does.
4. **Logic errors**. This problem requires some careful thinking to solve. It's easy to make a mistake in your logic and end up with a solution that doesn't work. For example, if you forget to check that a party's territory is connected, the program will think that the solution is valid when it's not.
5. **Runtime errors**. This problem can be solved in a variety of ways, and some of these solutions are more efficient than others. If you choose an inefficient solution, your program might run out of time and give a Time Limit Exceeded error.

To avoid these problems, it's important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements. It's also important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly.
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect input format**

```

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is very specific. Make sure that you parse the input correctly.
2. **Off-by-one error**. When iterating over the cells, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one cell or count one cell twice. Be careful when writing your code.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the problem is not very complicated, but it is easy to make a mistake. Make sure that you understand the problem correctly before you start coding.
4. **Runtime error**. The problem can be solved in O(n) time, but it is easy to write a solution that runs in O(n^2) time or even worse. Make sure that your solution is efficient.
5. **Memory error**. The problem does not require a lot of memory, but it is easy to write a solution that uses too much memory. Make sure that your solution is memory-efficient.

Possible problems and bugs:

* The input format is not correct. For example, the input may not contain an integer n, or the value of n may be less than 2 or greater than 216.
* The output format is not correct. For example, the output may not contain the correct number of integers, or the values of the integers may not be in the correct range.
* The program may not be able to handle all possible input cases. For example, the program may not be able to handle the case where the two rectangles intersect.
* The program may not be able to handle the case where the two rectangles are not disjoint.
* The program may not be able to handle the case where the two rectangles are not axis-aligned.
* The program may not be able to handle the case where the two rectangles are not parallel to the coordinate axes.
* The program may not be able to handle the case where the two rectangles are not contained in the same quadrant.

CODEFORCES 735_A. Ostap and Grasshopper

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrectly calculating the number of jumps.** The grasshopper can jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). This means that the number of jumps required to reach the insect is equal to the absolute value of the difference between the grasshopper's position and the insect's position, divided by k. For example, if the grasshopper is at position 3 and the insect is at position 7, then the number of jumps required is 7 - 3 = 4.
* **Incorrectly checking if the grasshopper can jump to a given cell.** The grasshopper can only jump to empty cells. This means that you need to check if the cell is empty before you try to jump to it.
* **Incorrectly handling obstacles.** The grasshopper cannot jump over obstacles. This means that you need to check if there is an obstacle in the way of the grasshopper before you try to jump to a given cell.
* **Incorrectly handling the case where the grasshopper cannot reach the insect.** If the grasshopper cannot reach the insect, then you need to print "NO".

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* **Be careful when calculating the number of jumps.** Make sure to divide the absolute value of the difference between the grasshopper's position and the insect's position by k.
* **Be careful when checking if the grasshopper can jump to a given cell.** Make sure to check if the cell is empty before you try to jump to it.
* **Be careful when handling obstacles.** Make sure to check if there is an obstacle in the way of the grasshopper before you try to jump to a given cell.
* **Be careful when handling the case where the grasshopper cannot reach the insect.** Make sure to print "NO" if the grasshopper cannot reach the insect.

Title:
CODEFORCES 77_E. Martian Food

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when reading the input data. For example, if the input data is "4 3 1 2", the program will try to read the fourth integer, which does not exist.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when writing the output data. For example, if the output data is "0.9230769231000001", the program will get a wrong answer.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The most common mistake is to make a mistake in the calculation of the radius of the Green Bull Terrier. For example, if the radius of the plate is 4, the radius of the Golden Honduras is 3, and the number of portions is 1, the radius of the Green Bull Terrier should be 0.9230769231, but the program may calculate it incorrectly.
4. **Incorrect error handling**. The program should handle errors correctly. For example, if the input data is invalid, the program should print an error message and exit.
5. **Incorrect code style**. The code should be well-written and easy to read. For example, the code should be divided into functions, and each function should have a clear purpose.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the program thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 946_E. Largest Beautiful Number

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem asks for the largest beautiful number **less than** s, but a developer may mistakenly think that it asks for the largest beautiful number **not greater than** s. This would lead to an incorrect solution.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the palindrome check.** A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards and forwards. For example, "racecar" is a palindrome. To check if a string is a palindrome, a developer can use the following algorithm:
    1. Reverse the string.
    2. Compare the original string to the reversed string.
    If the two strings are equal, then the original string is a palindrome. Otherwise, it is not a palindrome.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the largest beautiful number search.** The largest beautiful number less than s is the largest number that meets the following criteria:
    1. It is a palindrome.
    2. It is less than s.
    To find the largest beautiful number less than s, a developer can use the following algorithm:
    1. Start with the number s.
    2. While the number is not a palindrome, decrement the number by 1.
    3. If the number is less than 1, then the largest beautiful number less than s is 1. Otherwise, the largest beautiful number less than s is the current number.
4. **Incorrect output formatting.** The problem requires the output to be a single line containing the largest beautiful number less than s. A developer may mistakenly print the output in multiple lines or with incorrect formatting.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement. Additionally, it is important to carefully implement the palindrome check and the largest beautiful number search algorithm. Finally, it is important to pay attention to the output formatting requirements.

 1. **Incorrect implementation of the sliding window.** The sliding window is a very powerful technique that can be used to solve a variety of problems. However, it is important to implement the sliding window correctly in order to avoid bugs. One common mistake is to forget to update the window after each iteration. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The input to the problem may contain edge cases that need to be handled correctly. For example, the input may contain a negative number or a number that is too large. It is important to check for these edge cases and handle them appropriately.
3. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem may require the use of a specific data structure in order to solve it efficiently. For example, the problem may require the use of a heap or a hash table. It is important to use the correct data structure for the problem in order to avoid performance problems.
4. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** The problem may require the use of a specific algorithm in order to solve it efficiently. For example, the problem may require the use of a sorting algorithm or a search algorithm. It is important to use the correct algorithm for the problem in order to avoid performance problems.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The program should be able to handle errors gracefully. For example, the program should be able to handle the case where the input is invalid. It is important to handle errors correctly in order to avoid the program from crashing.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The variable `count` should be declared as an integer, not a string.
2. **Off-by-one error:** The condition `count % 2 != 0` should be `count % 2 == 1`.
3. **Incorrect logic:** The loop should iterate over the list of gifts, not the list of kingdoms.

Title:
HACKEREARTH chotu-and-teddy-day

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input contains two integers N and K. N is the number of coins and K is the value of the teddy. The developer may incorrectly use the `int` data type to store these values. This can lead to incorrect results if N or K is a large number.

To avoid this, the developer should use the `long` data type to store these values.

**2. Using incorrect comparison operator**

The output should be "YES" if Chotu can buy the teddy and "NO" if he cannot. The developer may incorrectly use the `==` operator to compare K to the sum of the coins. This can lead to incorrect results if K is not equal to the sum of the coins.

To avoid this, the developer should use the `>=` operator to compare K to the sum of the coins.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The developer may incorrectly use the following logic to determine if Chotu can buy the teddy:

```
if (K == sumOfCoins) {
    cout << "YES";
} else {
    cout << "NO";
}
```

This logic is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that Chotu may have more than one coin of the same value.

To avoid this, the developer should use the following logic:

```
for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    if (K % i == 0 && K / i <= N) {
        cout << "YES";
        return 0;
    }
}

cout << "NO";
```

This logic takes into account the fact that Chotu may have more than one coin of the same value.

2. **Incorrect use of `s.find()`**. The `s.find()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string. If you accidentally use `s.find()` to find the last occurrence of a substring, you will get incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When counting the number of replacements, it is easy to make off-by-one errors. For example, if you are counting the number of occurrences of a substring in a string, you might accidentally count the first occurrence twice or forget to count the last occurrence.
4. **Incorrect handling of empty strings**. If the input string is empty, you will need to handle this case correctly. For example, you might need to return a default value or raise an exception.
5. **Incorrect handling of invalid inputs**. The input may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or non-existent characters. You will need to handle these cases correctly. For example, you might need to print an error message or return a default value.

HACKEREARTH haunted

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem states that the first line should contain 2 space separated integers N and M. However, the sample input contains only 1 integer. This will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem states that each line should contain 2 space separated integers. However, the sample output contains only 1 integer. This will cause the program to output an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program should iterate through the input list of ages and keep track of the ghost who has won the most number of "Ghost of the Day" titles. However, the program does not do this. Instead, it simply prints out the first element of the input list every time. This will cause the program to output an incorrect answer.
4. **Memory leak**. The program does not free up the memory that it allocates for the input list. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
5. **Race condition**. The program does not use any synchronization mechanisms to ensure that multiple threads do not access the input list at the same time. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results.
6. **Security vulnerability**. The program does not sanitize the input data. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the program and execute it.

HACKEREARTH name-count

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. This means that if you divide 10 by 3, the modulo operator will return 1, because 10 divided by 3 has a remainder of 1. However, if you divide 11 by 3, the modulo operator will return 2, because 11 divided by 3 has a remainder of 2.
2. **Incorrect use of factorial function.** The factorial function (``math.factorial()``) returns the product of all the integers from 1 to a given number. For example, ``math.factorial(5)`` returns 120, because 120 is the product of the integers from 1 to 5. However, if you try to use the factorial function on a negative number, you will get an error.
3. **Incorrect use of the combination function.** The combination function (``math.comb()``) returns the number of ways to choose r items from a set of n items. For example, ``math.comb(5, 2)`` returns 10, because there are 10 ways to choose 2 items from a set of 5 items. However, if you try to use the combination function on a negative number or a number greater than n, you will get an error.
4. **Incorrect use of the permutation function.** The permutation function (``math.perm()``) returns the number of ways to arrange r items from a set of n items. For example, ``math.perm(5, 2)`` returns 20, because there are 20 ways to arrange 2 items from a set of 5 items. However, if you try to use the permutation function on a negative number or a number greater than n, you will get an error.
5. **Incorrect use of the in operator.** The in operator (``x in y``) returns True if the item x is in the list y. For example, ``'a' in ['a', 'b', 'c']`` returns True, because the item 'a' is in the list ['a', 'b', 'c']. However, if you try to use the in operator on a non-list, you will get an error.
6. **Incorrect use of the list comprehension.** A list comprehension is a concise way to create a list. For example, the following code creates a list of the numbers from 1 to 10:

```
numbers = [x for x in range(1, 11)]
```

However, if you try to use a list comprehension on a non-iterable object, you will get an error.

Title:
HACKEREARTH problem-5

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The input variables `a` and `n` are integers, but the code may incorrectly treat them as strings. This could lead to errors such as incorrect calculations or division by zero.
2. **Incorrect formula:** The formula for the sum of a geometric series is `S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)`, where `a` is the first term, `r` is the common ratio, and `n` is the number of terms. The code may incorrectly use a different formula, leading to incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one error:** The code may incorrectly calculate the value of `n`. For example, if `n` is 4, the code may incorrectly calculate the sum as `a + aa + aa*a + aa*a*a`, which is one term too few.
4. **Infinite loop:** The code may enter an infinite loop if the value of `n` is negative or zero.
5. **Memory leak:** The code may leak memory if it does not properly free the memory allocated for variables.
6. **Security vulnerability:** The code may be vulnerable to attacks if it does not properly validate user input.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully review the code and test it thoroughly.

Here are some specific examples of how these problems could be addressed:

* To avoid incorrect variable type errors, the code should explicitly cast the input variables to the correct type. For example, the following code would cast the input variables to integers:

```
a = int(input())
n = int(input())
```

* To avoid incorrect formula errors, the code should use the correct formula for the sum of a geometric series. For example, the following code would use the correct formula:

```
S = a * (1 - pow(r, n)) / (1 - r)
```

* To avoid off-by-one errors, the code should carefully check the value of `n` before calculating the sum. For example, the following code would check if `n` is negative or zero before calculating the sum:

```
if n < 0:
    raise ValueError("n must be non-negative")

if n == 0:
    S = 0
else:
    S = a + aa + aa*a + ... + aa*a*a
```

* To avoid infinite loops, the code should check the value of `n` before entering the loop. For example, the following code would check if `n` is negative or zero before entering the loop:

```
if n < 0:
    raise ValueError("n must be non-negative")

if n == 0:
    return 0

for i in range(1, n + 1):
    S += a * pow(r, i)
```

* To avoid memory leaks, the code should explicitly free the memory allocated for variables when they are no longer needed. For example, the following code would free the memory allocated for the variable `S` when it is no longer needed:

```
del S
```

* To avoid security vulnerabilities, the code should carefully validate user input. For example, the code should check if user input is in a valid format and should not allow users to input malicious code.

**Possible Problems:**

* The input format is not very clear. It is not clear what the `width[]` array represents. Is it the width of each segment of the service lane? Or is it the width of each segment of the highway?
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if the exit segment is before the entry segment.
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if the width of a segment is 0.
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if the width of a segment is greater than 3.

HACKEREARTH the-amazing-race-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement states that "a driver i cannot see beyond another driver j if height of  j ≥ height of driver i", but some solutions incorrectly check if "height of  i ≥ height of driver j".
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for finding the winning driver is as follows:
    1. Sort the drivers by height in descending order.
    2. For each driver, calculate its sight as (number of drivers he can see in front of him + number of drivers he can see behind him) * driver's position.
    3. The driver with the largest sight is the winning driver.
    Some solutions incorrectly implement this algorithm, which can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement states that "1 ≤  n  ≤ 10 ^ 5", but some solutions incorrectly handle inputs with n > 10 ^ 5.
4. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem statement states that "Second line contains n space separated integers H[1], H[2], H[3]...H[n] denoting the heights of the drivers 1, 2, 3....n", but some solutions incorrectly use a data structure that cannot store n elements.
5. **Incorrect use of mathematical functions.** The problem statement states that "SIGHT of a driver is defined by ( X * P ) % 1000000007", but some solutions incorrectly use mathematical functions that do not return a value modulo 1000000007.
6. **Incorrect use of the programming language.** Some solutions incorrectly use the programming language, which can lead to incorrect results or runtime errors.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement, correctly implement the algorithm, handle edge cases correctly, use the correct data structures and mathematical functions, and use the programming language correctly.

HACKEREARTH xenny-and

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator**. The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 returns 1. This means that 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.
2. **Incorrect use of the exponentiation operator**. The exponentiation operator (**) raises a number to a power. For example, 2 ** 3 returns 8. This means that 2 multiplied by itself 3 times is 8.
3. **Incorrect use of the factorial function**. The factorial function (!) returns the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to a given number. For example, 5! returns 120. This means that 120 is the product of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
4. **Incorrect use of the prime factorization function**. The prime factorization function returns a list of the prime factors of a given number. For example, the prime factorization of 10 is [2, 5]. This means that 10 can be expressed as the product of 2 and 5.
5. **Incorrect use of the sorting function**. The sorting function sorts a list of elements in ascending order. For example, the list [5, 3, 1] would be sorted to [1, 3, 5].

Here are some tips to help you avoid these common problems:

* **Be sure to understand the difference between the modulo operator and the exponentiation operator.** The modulo operator returns the remainder of a division operation, while the exponentiation operator raises a number to a power.
* **Be sure to use the correct parentheses when using the exponentiation operator.** The exponentiation operator has higher precedence than the modulo operator, so the expression 2 ** 3 % 4 evaluates to 2, not 1.
* **Be sure to understand the difference between the factorial function and the prime factorization function.** The factorial function returns the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to a given number, while the prime factorization function returns a list of the prime factors of a given number.
* **Be sure to use the correct sorting function.** The sorting function sorts a list of elements in ascending order.

By following these tips, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving problems involving prime factorization.

Title:
ATCODER p02641 AtCoder Beginner Contest 170 - Forbidden List

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data is a list of integers. If the developer uses the wrong data type to store the input data, it may cause problems when comparing the integers. For example, if the developer uses a string to store the input data, it will not be possible to compare the integers correctly.

**2. Using incorrect comparison operators**

The problem asks to find the integer nearest to X. To do this, the developer needs to compare the absolute difference between X and each of the integers in the input list. If the developer uses the wrong comparison operator, it may cause the wrong integer to be returned. For example, if the developer uses the `>` operator instead of the `<=` operator, it will return the integer that is greater than X instead of the integer that is closest to X.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The problem asks to find the integer nearest to X. To do this, the developer needs to find the integer in the input list that has the smallest absolute difference with X. The developer can do this by iterating through the input list and keeping track of the smallest absolute difference found so far. The integer that has the smallest absolute difference with X is the answer to the problem.

**4. Not handling edge cases correctly**

The problem specifies a few edge cases that the developer needs to handle correctly. For example, the problem specifies that the input list may be empty. If the developer does not handle this edge case correctly, it may cause the program to crash.

**5. Using inefficient algorithms**

The problem can be solved using a simple algorithm. However, the developer may be tempted to use a more complex algorithm in order to improve the performance of the program. However, this may not always be the best approach. The developer should carefully consider the trade-offs between performance and simplicity before choosing an algorithm.

2. **Incorrect comparison operator**. The problem states that a triple is poor if two of the numbers are equal but the other number is different. The code below compares `A`, `B`, and `C` using the `==` operator, which will return `True` if any two of the numbers are equal. This means that the code will incorrectly identify some triples as poor when they are not.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code below checks if `A`, `B`, and `C` are all equal. If they are, the code returns `No`. If any two of the numbers are equal, the code returns `Yes`. However, the problem states that a triple is poor if two of the numbers are equal but the other number is different. This means that the code will incorrectly identify some triples as poor when they are not.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The code below checks if `A`, `B`, and `C` are all equal. If they are, the code returns `No`. If any two of the numbers are equal, the code returns `Yes`. However, the problem states that a triple is poor if two of the numbers are equal but the other number is different. This means that the code will incorrectly identify some triples as poor when they are not.
5. **Incorrect indentation**. The code below is not properly indented, which can make it difficult to read and understand. This could lead to errors in debugging and maintenance.
6. **Missing whitespace**. The code below does not use any whitespace, which can make it difficult to read and understand. This could lead to errors in debugging and maintenance.
7. **Inefficient code**. The code below could be made more efficient by using a list comprehension to check if `A`, `B`, and `C` are all equal. This would reduce the number of comparisons that need to be performed.
8. **Unnecessary code**. The code below includes a `print` statement that is not necessary. This could be removed without affecting the functionality of the code.
9. **Unclear variable names**. The variable names `a`, `b`, and `c` are not very descriptive. This could make it difficult to understand the code.
10. **Misspelled words**. The word `triple` is misspelled in the code. This could lead to confusion.

2. **Arithmetic error**. The program may perform an arithmetic operation incorrectly, which may cause incorrect results. For example, if the program divides by zero, it may crash.
3. **Index out of bounds error**. The program may access an array or other data structure out of bounds, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the program tries to access the element at index 100 in an array that only has 10 elements, it may crash.
4. **Null pointer exception**. The program may try to access a null pointer, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the program tries to dereference a pointer that has not been initialized, it may crash.
5. **Stack overflow**. The program may call itself recursively too many times, which may cause the program to run out of stack space and crash.

### How to avoid these problems

To avoid these problems, it is important to follow the following guidelines:

1. **Use the correct input format**. Make sure that the input format is strictly followed. For example, the number of vertices should be a positive integer.
2. **Use the correct data type**. Make sure that the data type of the input is correct. For example, the number of vertices should be an integer, not a string.
3. **Write correct logic**. Make sure that the logic of the program is correct. For example, check if the input is valid before processing it.
4. **Release memory properly**. Make sure that the program releases memory properly. For example, free any allocated memory when it is no longer needed.
5. **Synchronize threads properly**. Make sure that threads are synchronized properly. For example, use locks to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.

By following these guidelines, you can help to avoid common problems and bugs when solving programming problems.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not correct. For example, the input format should be `N` followed by `w_1 s_1 v_1`, `w_2 s_2 v_2`, ..., `w_N s_N v_N`, but the input format may be `N w_1 s_1 v_1 w_2 s_2 v_2`.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not correct. For example, the output format should be a single integer, but the output may be a string.

**3. Overflow**

The input values may be too large and cause overflow. For example, the input values may be `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`, which will cause overflow when calculating the sum of the values.

**4. Time complexity**

The time complexity of the solution may be too high. For example, the solution may use a brute-force algorithm, which will have a time complexity of O(N^2).

**5. Space complexity**

The space complexity of the solution may be too high. For example, the solution may use a hash table to store all the blocks, which will have a space complexity of O(N).

ATCODER p03330 AtCoder Beginner Contest 099 - Good Grid

Pain points:
**1. Incorrectly calculating the wrongness of a square**

The wrongness of a square is the difference between the cost of painting the square in the original color and the cost of painting the square in the new color. For example, if the original color of the square is 1 and the new color is 2, the wrongness is 12. However, some developers may incorrectly calculate the wrongness as 21. This is because they are subtracting the cost of painting the square in the new color from the cost of painting the square in the original color, instead of the other way around.

**2. Forgetting to account for the fact that the colors of adjacent squares must be different**

Another common mistake is to forget to account for the fact that the colors of adjacent squares must be different. This means that if two adjacent squares are both painted in the same color, the wrongness of the two squares will be doubled. For example, if two adjacent squares are both painted in color 1, the wrongness of the two squares will be 21 + 21 = 42.

**3. Using incorrect data types**

Some developers may use incorrect data types when storing the colors of the squares or the costs of painting the squares. This can lead to incorrect results. For example, if a developer uses a 32-bit integer to store the colors of the squares, they may not be able to represent all of the possible colors. This could lead to incorrect results if a square is painted in a color that cannot be represented by the data type.

**4. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The most efficient algorithm for solving this problem is to use dynamic programming. This algorithm works by building up a table of the minimum wrongness for each possible state of the grid. The table is then used to find the minimum wrongness for the entire grid.

**5. Not handling special cases correctly**

There are a few special cases that developers should be aware of when solving this problem. For example, if the grid is empty, the wrongness is 0. Additionally, if all of the squares are painted in the same color, the wrongness is also 0.

**6. Not testing the code thoroughly**

It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. This can be done by creating a variety of test cases and checking that the code produces the correct results.

```

However, the input may not be in the correct format. For example, the input may be missing the first line, or it may have extra spaces in it.

To handle this problem, you can use the `re` module in Python to parse the input. For example, you can use the following code to parse the input:

```python

N = int(input())
a = list(map(int, re.split('\s+', input())))
```

**2. The output format is not correct**

The output format is given as follows:

```
The minimum number of elements that needs to be removed so that a will be a good sequence.
```

However, the output may not be in the correct format. For example, the output may not be a number, or it may have extra spaces in it.

To handle this problem, you can use the `int` function to convert the output to a number. For example, you can use the following code to convert the output to a number:

```python
print(int(input()))
```

**3. The input data is invalid**

The input data may be invalid. For example, the input data may contain negative numbers, or it may contain numbers that are too large.

To handle this problem, you can use the `assert` statement to check the validity of the input data. For example, you can use the following code to check the validity of the input data:

```python
assert N > 0
assert all(1 <= a_i <= 10 ** 9 for a_i in a)
```

**4. The algorithm is incorrect**

The algorithm you use to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, your algorithm may not find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed, or it may find an incorrect answer.

To handle this problem, you can use the following techniques:

* **Test your algorithm on a few small examples.** This will help you to identify any bugs in your algorithm.
* **Use a debugger to step through your algorithm.** This will help you to identify the specific lines of code that are causing the problem.
* **Ask for help from other programmers.** There are many online forums and communities where you can ask for help with programming problems.

**5. The implementation is inefficient**

Your implementation of the algorithm may be inefficient. For example, your implementation may take too long to run, or it may use too much memory.

To handle this problem, you can use the following techniques:

* **Use a more efficient algorithm.** There are many different algorithms that you can use to solve this problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others.
* **Use a more efficient data structure.** The data structure you use to store the input data can have a significant impact on the performance of your algorithm.
* **Use a compiler to optimize your code.** A compiler can optimize your code to make it run faster and use less memory.

ATCODER p03651 AtCoder Grand Contest 018 - Getting Difference

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The developer may make a mistake in implementing the algorithm, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer might forget to check for a corner case, or they might use the wrong data type for a variable.
2. **Incorrect input handling.** The developer may not properly handle invalid input, which could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results. For example, the developer might not check for negative numbers or non-integer values.
3. **Memory leaks.** The developer may not properly free up memory that is allocated during the execution of the program, which could lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
4. **Race conditions.** The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data, which could lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
5. **Security vulnerabilities.** The developer may introduce security vulnerabilities in the program, which could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully review their code and test it thoroughly before deploying it to production. They should also use a debugger to help identify any errors that may be present in the code.

ATCODER p03807 AtCoder Grand Contest 010 - Addition

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly handling edge cases.** The input constraints specify that `2 <= N <= 10^5`, but the code below does not check for this. If `N < 2`, the code will throw an error.
2. **Using incorrect data types.** The input values are integers, but the code below uses floating-point numbers. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Using incorrect operators.** The code below uses the `%` operator to check for even numbers, but this operator returns the remainder of a division operation. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Not using the right algorithm.** The code below uses a brute-force approach to solve the problem, which is inefficient. A more efficient approach would be to use dynamic programming.
5. **Not handling errors correctly.** The code below does not handle errors correctly. If an error occurs, the program will simply terminate. This can lead to unexpected results.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the constraints. It is also important to use the correct data types and operators. Finally, it is important to use the right algorithm and to handle errors correctly.

Title:
ATCODER p03975 Kyoto University Programming Contest 2016 - A Barricade

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input is "5 5 9 4 3 6 9 1", the program will crash because the first line does not contain 3 integers.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may not be in the correct data type. For example, if the input is "5 5 9 a 3 6 9 1", the program will crash because the first integer is not an integer.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The program may not correctly calculate the number of classes that the student can attend. For example, if the input is "5 5 9 4 3 6 9 1", the program may incorrectly output 3 instead of 4.
4. **Infinite loop**. The program may enter an infinite loop if the input data is not correctly handled. For example, if the input is "5 5 9 4 3 6 9 1", the program may enter an infinite loop because the student can attend all 5 classes.
5. **Memory leak**. The program may not release memory properly, which may cause the program to crash or run out of memory. For example, if the program uses a large array to store the input data, the program may not release the memory after the data is no longer needed.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is specified as "Sentences with embedded positive integers are given over multiple lines. Each line is a character string containing single-byte alphanumeric characters, symbols, and spaces, or a blank line. However, you are guaranteed to enter no more than 80 characters per line and a PIN of 10,000 or less.". A developer may incorrectly parse the input and produce incorrect results.
2. **Integer overflow.** The PIN is guaranteed to be 10,000 or less, but a developer may incorrectly calculate the sum of the integers and produce an integer overflow error.
3. **Off-by-one error.** The developer may incorrectly iterate over the input lines and miss one or more integers.
4. **Incorrect use of whitespace.** The developer may incorrectly use whitespace in the output, resulting in the PIN being incorrect.

Title:
AIZU p00196 Baseball Championship

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not well-defined.** The input format specifies that the number of teams n is an integer from 2 to 10, but it does not specify the format of the team names. This could lead to problems if the team names contain non-alphabetic characters or are longer than one character.
2. **The output format is not well-defined.** The output format specifies that the team names should be output in order from the top team, but it does not specify what to do if there are multiple teams with the same rank. This could lead to problems if the teams are not output in the same order each time.
3. **The program may not be able to handle all possible input cases.** The program is only tested on a limited number of input cases, so it is possible that it will not be able to handle all possible input cases. This could lead to errors or unexpected results.
4. **The program may be inefficient.** The program uses a brute-force approach to solve the problem, which could be inefficient for large datasets. This could lead to long running times or memory problems.
5. **The program may not be robust.** The program does not handle errors gracefully, which could lead to crashes or unexpected results. This could make it difficult to use the program in a production environment.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully consider the input format and output format, and make sure that the program is able to handle all possible input cases. The developer should also test the program on a variety of input cases to make sure that it is working correctly. Finally, the developer should make sure that the program is efficient and robust.

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly parsed. For example, the input string `1 1 7` should be parsed as `1, 1, 7`, but it is parsed as `1, 1, 7`. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is not correctly converted to the correct data type. For example, the input string `100` should be parsed as an integer, but it is parsed as a string. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program is incorrect. For example, the program may not correctly calculate the maximum aesthetic value of the wall. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correctly specified. For example, the output should be an integer, but it is a string. This can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Memory leak**. The program may not correctly release memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
6. **Race condition**. The program may not correctly handle concurrent access to shared resources. This can lead to incorrect results or even a program crash.
7. **Deadlock**. The program may enter a deadlock state, where it is unable to continue execution. This can also cause the program to crash.
8. **Security vulnerability**. The program may contain a security vulnerability, which can allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system. This can have serious consequences, such as data theft or system compromise.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design and implement your program. You should also test your program thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and does not contain any bugs.

AIZU p01251 Left Hand Rule

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect maze representation**. The maze is represented by a collection of walls placed on the two-dimensional grid. We use an ordinary Cartesian coordinate system; the positive x-axis points right and the positive y-axis points up. Each wall is represented by a line segment which is parallel to the x-axis or the y-axis, such that both ends of each wall are located on integer coordinates. The size of the maze is given by W and H that indicate the width and the height of the maze, respectively. A rectangle whose vertices are on (0, 0), (W, 0), (W, H) and (0, H) forms the outside boundary of the maze. The outside of the maze is always surrounded by walls except for the entrance of the maze. The entrance is represented by a line segment whose ends are (xE, yE) and (xE', yE'). The entrance has a unit length and is located somewhere on one edge of the boundary. The exit is a unit square whose bottom left corner is located on (xX, yX).

**Solution:** Make sure that the maze is represented correctly.

2. **Incorrect input format**. The input is formatted as follows:

```
W H N
x1 y1 x1' y1'
x2 y2 x2' y2'
...
xN yN xN' yN'
xE yE xE' yE' xX yX
```

**Solution:** Make sure that the input is formatted correctly.

3. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a line that contains the number of steps required to reach the exit. If the given maze is unsolvable, print “Impossible” instead of the number of steps.

**Solution:** Make sure that the output is formatted correctly.

4. **Maze is unsolvable**. If the given maze is unsolvable, print “Impossible” instead of the number of steps.

**Solution:** Check if the maze is unsolvable.

Title:
AIZU p01728 KuruKuruKururin

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not clear.**

The input format is not clear. For example, it is not clear whether the coordinates of the endpoints of the obstacles are given in the order of (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ... or (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn). This can lead to bugs if the developer does not correctly parse the input.

**2. The constraints are not clear.**

The constraints are not clear. For example, it is not clear whether the distance between two line segments is measured as the Euclidean distance or the Manhattan distance. This can lead to bugs if the developer does not correctly implement the distance calculation.

**3. The output format is not clear.**

The output format is not clear. For example, it is not clear whether the output should be a number or a string. This can lead to bugs if the developer does not correctly format the output.

**4. The problem is not well-defined.**

The problem is not well-defined. For example, it is not clear what happens if the heliline is rotated so that it intersects an obstacle. This can lead to bugs if the developer does not correctly handle this case.

**5. The solution is not optimal.**

The solution is not optimal. For example, the solution does not take into account the fact that the heliline can rotate around any point on the line segment, not just the midpoint. This can lead to a sub-optimal solution.

Title:
AIZU p01866 Hamming Distance

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the Hamming distance formula.** The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of bits in which they differ. For example, the Hamming distance between 00001 and 11101 is 3, because the first two bits are the same, the third bit is different, and the fourth and fifth bits are the same.
2. **Incorrect use of the bitwise operators.** The bitwise operators &, |, and ^ can be used to perform bitwise AND, OR, and XOR operations on two integers. For example, the expression x & y will return the bitwise AND of x and y, which is the same as the bits that are set in both x and y.
3. **Incorrect use of the shift operators.** The shift operators << and >> can be used to shift the bits of an integer left or right by a specified number of places. For example, the expression x << 1 will shift the bits of x left by one place, which is the same as multiplying x by 2.
4. **Incorrect use of the bitmask operator.** The bitmask operator ~ can be used to invert all of the bits of an integer. For example, the expression ~x will return the bitwise complement of x, which is the same as subtracting x from 2^n, where n is the number of bits in x.
5. **Incorrect use of the modulus operator.** The modulus operator % can be used to find the remainder of dividing one integer by another. For example, the expression x % y will return the remainder of dividing x by y.
6. **Incorrect use of the ternary operator.** The ternary operator ? : can be used to conditionally evaluate an expression. For example, the expression x ? y : z will return y if x is true, and z if x is false.
7. **Incorrect use of the comma operator.** The comma operator , can be used to separate multiple expressions in a single statement. For example, the expression x, y will first evaluate x and then evaluate y.
8. **Incorrect use of the short-circuit evaluation operator.** The short-circuit evaluation operators && and || can be used to evaluate two expressions in a single statement. For example, the expression x && y will first evaluate x and then evaluate y, but only if x is true.
9. **Incorrect use of the break statement.** The break statement can be used to terminate a loop early. For example, the following code will terminate the loop if x is equal to 0:
```
while (true) {
  if (x == 0) {
    break;
  }
  // Do something with x
}
```
10. **Incorrect use of the continue statement.** The continue statement can be used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop. For example, the following code will skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop if x is equal to 0:
```
while (true) {
  if (x == 0) {
    continue;
  }
  // Do something with x
}
```

Title:
AIZU p02003 Board

Pain points:
1. The developer may not understand the problem correctly. For example, they may think that they can place tiles on squares without holes, or that they can place tiles in any direction.
2. The developer may not be able to come up with an efficient algorithm to solve the problem. For example, they may try to brute-force the problem, or they may use an algorithm that is too slow.
3. The developer may not be able to write their code correctly. For example, they may make syntax errors, or they may not handle corner cases correctly.
4. The developer may not be able to test their code effectively. For example, they may not test their code on a variety of inputs, or they may not test their code for robustness.
5. The developer may not be able to submit their code correctly. For example, they may not follow the submission guidelines, or they may not submit their code on time.

Title:
AIZU p02147 A Polygon And Circles

Pain points:
**1. Input format**

The input format is not clearly defined. It is not clear whether the input is a list of numbers or a list of lists. This can lead to errors if the input is not formatted correctly.

**2. Floating-point arithmetic**

Floating-point arithmetic is not exact, and rounding errors can lead to incorrect results. This is especially important when the input values are close to zero.

**3. Numerical instability**

Some numerical algorithms can become unstable when the input values are large or small. This can lead to incorrect results or even crashes.

**4. Overflow**

Integer arithmetic can overflow when the input values are too large. This can lead to incorrect results or even crashes.

**5. Underflow**

Floating-point arithmetic can underflow when the input values are too small. This can lead to incorrect results or even crashes.

**6. Undefined behavior**

Some programming languages allow undefined behavior, which means that the program can behave in any way when it encounters certain conditions. This can lead to incorrect results or even crashes.

**7. Security vulnerabilities**

Some programming languages have security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. This can lead to unauthorized access to data or even system compromise.

**8. Incorrect assumptions**

The developer may make incorrect assumptions about the input data or the behavior of the program. This can lead to incorrect results or even crashes.

**9. Incorrect implementation**

The developer may implement the program incorrectly. This can lead to incorrect results or even crashes.

**10. Lack of testing**

The developer may not test the program adequately. This can lead to incorrect results or even crashes.

Title:
AIZU p02288 Maximum Heap

Pain points:
1. **Not understanding the problem.** The problem is about constructing a max-heap from an array. A max-heap is a binary tree where the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children. The largest element in a max-heap is stored at the root.
2. **Misunderstanding the pseudocode.** The pseudocode for maxHeapify is as follows:

```
maxHeapify(A, i)
    l = left(i)
    r = right(i)
    # select the node which has the maximum value
    if l <= H and A[l] > A[i]
        largest = l
    else
        largest = i
    if r <= H and A[r] > A[largest]
        largest = r

    if largest != i # value of children is larger than that of i
        swap A[i] and A[largest]
        maxHeapify(A, largest) # call recursively
```

The important part to understand is that maxHeapify only swaps the values of two nodes if the value of the child is larger than the value of the parent.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the pseudocode.** The most common mistake is to swap the values of the nodes without checking if the value of the child is larger than the value of the parent. This will result in a heap that is not a max-heap.
4. **Not handling the base case.** The base case for maxHeapify is when the node has no children. In this case, the node is already a max-heap and no further processing is necessary.
5. **Not using a recursive approach.** The pseudocode for maxHeapify is recursive. This means that it calls itself on the children of the current node. This is necessary to ensure that the entire heap is a max-heap.
6. **Not using the correct order for the loop.** The loop in the buildMaxHeap procedure should iterate from H/2 downto 1. This is because the nodes at the bottom of the heap are already max-heaps, so they do not need to be processed.
7. **Not printing the values of the nodes in the correct order.** The output of the program should print the values of the nodes in the max-heap in order of their id. This means that the largest value should be printed first, followed by the second largest value, and so on.
8. **Using the wrong data type for the array.** The array used to store the values of the nodes in the heap must be a dynamic array. This is because the size of the heap may change during the execution of the program.

Title:
AIZU p02435 Stack

Pain points:
4
3
 **1. Using the wrong data type for the stack.** The problem states that the stack should be able to hold integers from -1,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000. If you use a data type that is too small, you will get an overflow error.
2. **Not handling the case where the stack is empty.** The problem states that if the stack is empty, you should do nothing. Make sure to check for this case and handle it appropriately.
3. **Misusing the stack.** The stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure. This means that the last element that was pushed onto the stack is the first element that should be popped off. Make sure that you are using the stack in the correct way.
4. **Not using the stack in a thread-safe manner.** If you are using multiple threads to access the stack, you need to make sure that the stack is thread-safe. This means that you need to use locks to prevent multiple threads from accessing the stack at the same time.
5. **Not handling errors correctly.** The problem states that the input should be valid. However, it is possible that the input could be invalid. Make sure to handle invalid input gracefully.
6. **Not testing your code.** It is important to test your code thoroughly before you deploy it to production. This will help you to catch bugs and ensure that your code is working correctly.
