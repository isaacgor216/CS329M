Title:
CODECHEF astring

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type to store the input string.** The input string is a sequence of characters, so it should be stored in a string data type. If it is stored in a list or array data type, the characters will be converted to integers, which will lead to incorrect results.
2. **Using the wrong algorithm to find the lexicographically smallest subsequence.** The lexicographically smallest subsequence is the subsequence that comes first in the dictionary. There are several different algorithms that can be used to find the lexicographically smallest subsequence, but the most efficient algorithm is the dynamic programming algorithm.
3. **Not handling the special cases correctly.** There are a few special cases that need to be handled when finding the lexicographically smallest subsequence. For example, if the input string is empty, the lexicographically smallest subsequence is the empty string.
4. **Making a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm.** The dynamic programming algorithm for finding the lexicographically smallest subsequence is a fairly complex algorithm, so it is easy to make a mistake in the implementation. It is important to carefully check the code to make sure that it is correct.
5. **Not testing the code thoroughly.** It is important to test the code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. This can be done by creating a variety of test cases and checking that the code produces the correct results.

Title:
CODECHEF clost

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of stack.** The stack should be used to track the number of open parentheses. If the number of open parentheses exceeds the number of closed parentheses, the string is not balanced.
2. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The string may be empty or contain only one character. In these cases, the string is always balanced.
3. **Incorrect use of indices.** The indices in the queries should be checked to make sure they are valid. For example, a query with x > y is invalid.
4. **Incorrect handling of multiple queries.** The queries should be processed in order. If a query invalidates a previous query, the previous query should be ignored.
5. **Incorrect output.** The output string should be a valid parentheses expression. The string should not contain any invalid characters.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the constraints. It is also important to test your code thoroughly to make sure it handles all possible cases correctly.

Title:
CODECHEF flow006

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain an integer T, which is the number of test cases. The following lines should each contain an integer N. If the input format is not correct, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the output should be a single integer for each test case, which is the sum of the digits of N. If the output format is not correct, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the sum of the digits of N, it is important to make sure that you do not miss any digits or count any digits twice. This can be a common source of errors, especially when the number N is large.
4. **Arithmetic errors.** When performing arithmetic operations on large numbers, it is important to make sure that the numbers are properly represented and that the operations are performed correctly. This can be a common source of errors, especially when the numbers are very large or when the operations are complex.
5. **Memory errors.** When working with large numbers, it is important to make sure that the program has enough memory to store the numbers and perform the calculations. If the program runs out of memory, it may crash or produce incorrect output.
6. **Timeout errors.** When working with large numbers, it is important to make sure that the program does not take too long to run. If the program runs for too long, it may be terminated by the operating system, which will result in an incorrect output.
7. **Other errors.** There are a number of other possible errors that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These errors can include logical errors, syntax errors, and runtime errors. It is important to be aware of these potential errors and to take steps to avoid them.

Title:
CODECHEF submat

Pain points:
The maximum possible sub-square matrix dimension is 2X2.
 **1. The developer may not correctly understand the problem statement.**

The problem statement is not very clear. It is not immediately obvious what is meant by a "sub-square matrix". The developer may incorrectly assume that a sub-square matrix is a square matrix that is a subset of the original matrix. This would be incorrect, as a sub-square matrix can be any rectangular matrix that is a subset of the original matrix.

**2. The developer may not correctly implement the algorithm to find the maximum possible sub-square matrix.**

The algorithm to find the maximum possible sub-square matrix is not very straightforward. The developer may make mistakes in implementing the algorithm, which could lead to incorrect results.

**3. The developer may not correctly handle the corner cases.**

The problem statement includes some corner cases, such as a matrix with no 1's or a matrix with all 1's. The developer must be careful to handle these corner cases correctly, or the algorithm will not work correctly.

**4. The developer may not correctly test the code.**

The developer must write tests to ensure that the code is correct. The tests should cover all of the different cases that the code could encounter, including the corner cases. Without adequate testing, the developer cannot be sure that the code is correct.

**5. The developer may not correctly document the code.**

The developer must document the code so that other developers can understand how it works. The documentation should include a description of the algorithm, the inputs and outputs of the code, and any other relevant information. Without adequate documentation, other developers will not be able to use the code effectively.

Title:
CODEFORCES 100_F. Polynom

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect variable type**

The input contains integers, so the variables used to store them should be of type `int`. If you use a different type, such as `float`, the program will not work correctly.

**2. Incorrect variable initialization**

The variables used to store the coefficients of the polynomial should be initialized to zero. If you do not do this, the program will not work correctly.

**3. Incorrect use of the `for` loop**

The `for` loop is used to iterate over the coefficients of the polynomial. If you do not use the `for` loop correctly, the program will not work correctly.

**4. Incorrect use of the `if` statement**

The `if` statement is used to check if a coefficient is zero. If you do not use the `if` statement correctly, the program will not work correctly.

**5. Incorrect output format**

The output of the program should be in the form of a polynomial, with each term written in the form `C*X^K`. If you do not format the output correctly, the program will not be accepted.

**6. Incorrect error handling**

If the input is not in the correct format, the program should print an error message and exit. If you do not handle errors correctly, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
Test inputs:
**1. Incorrect variable type**

```
n=int(input())
a=[int(i) for i in input().split()]
for i in range(0,n):
    print(f"{a[i]**(n-i)}*X^{n-i}",end="")
```

This program will not work correctly because the variables `n` and `a` are of type `int`, but the variable `i` is of type `float`. This will cause the program to crash when it tries to calculate `a[i]**(n-i)`.

**2. Incorrect variable initialization**

```
n=int(input())
a=[int(i) for i in input().split()]
for i in range(0,n):
    b[i]=0
    if(a[i]!=0):
        print(f"{a[i]**(n-i)}*X^{n-i}",end="")
```

This program will not work correctly because the variables `b[i]` are not initialized to zero. This will cause the program to produce incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect use of the `for` loop**

```
n=int(input())
a=[int(i) for i in input().split()]
for i in range(0,n):
    print(f"{a[i]**(n-i)}*X^{n-i}",end="")
```

This program will not work correctly because the `for` loop is not iterating over the correct range of values. The loop should iterate from 0 to `n-1`, but it is currently iterating from 0 to `n`. This will cause the program to produce incorrect output.

**4. Incorrect use of the `if` statement**

```
n=int(input())
a=[int(i) for i in input().split()]
for i in range(0,n):
    b[i]=0
    if(a[i]!=0):
        print(f"{a[i]**(n-i)}*X^{n-i}",end="")
    else:
        print("0")
```

This program will not work correctly because the `if` statement is not checking the correct condition. The condition should be `a[i]!=0`, but it is currently checking `b[i]!=0`. This will cause the program to produce incorrect output.

**5. Incorrect output format**

```
n=int(input())
a=[int(i) for i in input().split()]
for i in range(0,n):
    print(f"{a[i]**(n-i)}*X^{n-i}",end="")
```

This program will not work correctly because the output is not formatted correctly. The output should be in the form of a polynomial, with each term written in the form `C*X^K`. The program is currently printing the terms in the form `C*X^(n-i)`. This will cause the program to produce incorrect output.

**6. Incorrect error handling**

```
n=int(input())
a=[int(i) for i in input().split()]
for i in range(0,n):
    b[i]=0
    if(a[i]!=0):
        print(f"{a[i]**(n-i)}*X^{n-i}",end="")
    else:
        print("0")
```

This program will not work correctly because it does not handle errors correctly. If the input is not in the correct format, the program will crash. The program should print an error message and exit if the input is not in the correct format.
Title:
CODEFORCES 1033_C. Permutation Game

Pain points:
 * 1. **Incorrect data type**. The input is a list of integers, but the code is expecting a list of strings.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The code is checking if the current cell is equal to the next cell, but it should be checking if the current cell is less than the next cell.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code is assuming that Alice always wins, but this is not always the case.
4. **Infinite loop**. The code is not checking if the game has reached a terminal state, so it could potentially run forever.
5. **Memory leak**. The code is not freeing up memory after it is no longer needed, which could eventually lead to a memory overflow.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1056_A. Determine Line

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type:** The input data is a list of integers. If we use the wrong data type to store the input data, we may get unexpected results. For example, if we use a string to store the input data, we may get a runtime error when we try to access the elements of the list.
2. **Using the wrong algorithm:** The correct algorithm to solve this problem is to use a set to store the lines of trams that Arkady saw. Then, we can print all the elements of the set. However, if we use the wrong algorithm, we may get incorrect results. For example, if we use a list to store the lines of trams that Arkady saw, we may get duplicate elements in the list.
3. **Not handling corner cases:** The input data may contain corner cases. For example, the input data may be empty. If we do not handle corner cases properly, we may get incorrect results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1078_B. The Unbearable Lightness of Weights

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may not be able to parse it correctly.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The program may make mistakes when calculating the answer. For example, if the program uses the wrong formula to calculate the answer, the output may be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program may have incorrect logic, which may cause it to give the wrong answer. For example, if the program does not consider all possible cases, it may not be able to find the optimal solution.
4. **Memory leak**. The program may not release memory properly, which may cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
5. **Timeout**. The program may take too long to run, which may cause it to time out and not give an answer.
6. **Incorrect output format**. The program may not output the answer in the correct format, which may cause the judge to reject the submission.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully check your code for errors before submitting it. You should also make sure that your code is well-documented and easy to understand.
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect input format**

```
n = int(input())
a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
```

This input format is incorrect because it does not specify the type of the input. The program will crash if the user enters a non-integer value.

2. **Incorrect calculation**

```
n = int(input())
a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

total = sum(a)

if total % 2 == 0:
    print(total // 2)
else:
    print(total // 2 + 1)
```

This program is incorrect because it does not consider the case where the total mass of the weights is odd. In this case, the program will output the wrong answer.

3. **Incorrect logic**

```
n = int(input())
a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

total = sum(a)

if total % 2 == 0:
    print(total // 2)
else:
    # Find the largest weight
    largest = max(a)

    # Subtract the largest weight from the total mass
    total -= largest

    # Find the number of weights that can be revealed
    print(total // 2)
```

This program is incorrect because it does not consider the case where the largest weight is greater than half of the total mass. In this case, the program will output the wrong answer.

4. **Memory leak**

```
n = int(input())
a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

total = sum(a)

if total % 2 == 0:
    print(total // 2)
else:
    print(total // 2 + 1)
```

This program has a memory leak because it does not release the memory used by the list `a`. The program will eventually run out of memory and crash.

5. **Timeout**

```
n = int(input())
a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

total = sum(a)

if total % 2 == 0:
    print(total // 2)
else:
    print(total // 2 + 1)
```

This program will timeout because it takes too long to run. The program should be rewritten to be more efficient.

6. **Incorrect output format**

```
n = int(input())
a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

total = sum(a)

if total % 2 == 0:
    print(total // 2)
else:
    print(total // 2 + 1)
```

This program outputs the answer in the wrong format. The answer should be a single integer, not a list of integers.
Title:
CODEFORCES 1099_B. Squares and Segments

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the only line of input should contain a single integer n. However, if the input contains multiple integers, or if it contains non-integers, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the program should print a single integer, the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide. However, if the program prints multiple integers, or if it prints non-integers, the output will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of segments.** The program must calculate the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide. However, if the program calculates the wrong number of segments, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect use of variables.** The program must use variables correctly in order to calculate the minimum number of segments. However, if the program uses variables incorrectly, the calculation will be incorrect and the output will be incorrect.
5. **Incorrect logic.** The program must use correct logic in order to calculate the minimum number of segments. However, if the program uses incorrect logic, the calculation will be incorrect and the output will be incorrect.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to carefully design the program and use variables correctly. Finally, it is important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it is correct.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain three space-separated integers, but the input may contain a different number of integers, or the integers may not be separated by spaces.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input format specifies that the integers should be positive, but the input may contain negative integers or non-integers.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The problem statement specifies that the sum of the integers should be less than or equal to y, but the solution may not satisfy this condition.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The solution may print the integers in the wrong order, or it may print an extra integer or miss an integer.
5. **Memory leak**. The solution may not free up memory that it has allocated, which can lead to a memory leak.
6. **Race condition**. The solution may not be thread-safe, which can lead to incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data simultaneously.
7. **Security vulnerability**. The solution may not be secure, which can allow attackers to exploit the program to gain unauthorized access to the system.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1146_F. Leaf Partition

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The tree traversal algorithm should visit all nodes in the tree in a specific order, such as preorder, inorder, or postorder.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of ways to partition the leaves.** This is another common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The number of ways to partition the leaves is equal to the number of ways to choose a subset of the leaves such that the corresponding subgraphs are disjoint.
3. **Modulo arithmetic error.** When calculating the number of ways to partition the leaves, it is important to use modulo arithmetic to ensure that the results are correct.
4. **Off-by-one error.** This is a common mistake that can occur when counting the number of leaves in the tree or the number of ways to partition the leaves.
5. **Incorrect use of the 998244353 prime.** This prime number is used to ensure that the results of the calculation are correct. It is important to use this prime number correctly in order to avoid errors.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements. It is also important to carefully implement the tree traversal algorithm and the calculation of the number of ways to partition the leaves.

Possible problems and bugs:

1. **Incorrect implementation of the `get_prefix_sum()` function.** The function should calculate the prefix sum of the array `arr` up to the index `k`, but in the given implementation, the prefix sum is calculated up to the index `i`. This will result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator should be used to ensure that the answer is a multiple of `10**9 + 7`, but in the given implementation, the modulo operator is not used. This will result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect use of the `%` operator.** The `%` operator should be used to calculate the remainder of a division, but in the given implementation, the `%` operator is used to calculate the quotient of a division. This will result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect use of the `*` operator.** The `*` operator should be used to multiply two numbers, but in the given implementation, the `*` operator is used to add two numbers. This will result in an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect use of the `+` operator.** The `+` operator should be used to add two numbers, but in the given implementation, the `+` operator is used to subtract two numbers. This will result in an incorrect answer.
Test inputs:

This input will cause the following problems:

1. The `get_prefix_sum()` function will calculate the prefix sum of the array `a` up to the index `i`, which is incorrect.
2. The modulo operator will not be used to ensure that the answer is a multiple of `10**9 + 7`, which will result in an incorrect answer.
3. The `%` operator will be used to calculate the quotient of a division, which will result in an incorrect answer.
4. The `*` operator will be used to add two numbers, which will result in an incorrect answer.
5. The `+` operator will be used to subtract two numbers, which will result in an incorrect answer.

The correct answer to this problem is `167`.

CODEFORCES 1266_F. Almost Same Distance

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the DFS algorithm.** The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that traverses a graph by exploring its vertices in a depth-first order. It is a very powerful tool for finding connected components, Strongly Connected Components, and other graph properties. However, it is important to implement the DFS algorithm correctly, or you may get incorrect results.
2. **Using an incorrect data structure.** The data structure you use to store the graph can have a significant impact on the performance of your DFS algorithm. For example, using an adjacency list is much faster than using an adjacency matrix.
3. **Not handling edge cases correctly.** There are a few edge cases that you need to be aware of when implementing the DFS algorithm. For example, what happens if you try to visit a vertex that has already been visited? What happens if you try to visit a vertex that does not exist in the graph?
4. **Not using the DFS algorithm efficiently.** The DFS algorithm can be very inefficient if you do not use it efficiently. For example, if you do not prune your search tree, you may end up visiting the same vertices multiple times.
5. **Making a mistake in your code.** Even the most experienced programmers make mistakes. It is important to carefully check your code for errors before running it.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

1. **Use a well-tested implementation of the DFS algorithm.** There are many different implementations of the DFS algorithm available online. If you are not confident in your ability to implement the algorithm correctly, you should use a well-tested implementation.
2. **Choose the right data structure for your graph.** The data structure you use to store the graph can have a significant impact on the performance of your DFS algorithm. For example, using an adjacency list is much faster than using an adjacency matrix.
3. **Handle edge cases correctly.** There are a few edge cases that you need to be aware of when implementing the DFS algorithm. For example, what happens if you try to visit a vertex that has already been visited? What happens if you try to visit a vertex that does not exist in the graph?
4. **Use the DFS algorithm efficiently.** The DFS algorithm can be very inefficient if you do not use it efficiently. For example, if you do not prune your search tree, you may end up visiting the same vertices multiple times.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1288_A. Deadline

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line contains a single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 50) — the number of test cases. However, the input may contain a different number of test cases, or the first line may not contain a single integer.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that each test case should be printed on a separate line. However, the output may contain multiple test cases on a single line, or the test cases may not be separated by newlines.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of days required to optimize the program.** The program's running time is calculated using the formula ```(d)/(x + 1)```, where ```d``` is the number of days the program runs and ```x``` is the number of days spent optimizing the program. However, the calculation may be incorrect if ```d``` is not a whole number.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the total number of days required to complete the project.** The total number of days required to complete the project is calculated using the formula ```x + \left⌈ (d)/(x + 1) \right⌉```, where ```x``` is the number of days spent optimizing the program and ```d``` is the number of days the program runs. However, the calculation may be incorrect if ```d``` is not a whole number.
5. **Incorrect comparison of the total number of days required to complete the project with the deadline.** The output should be ```YES``` if the total number of days required to complete the project is less than or equal to the deadline, and ```NO``` otherwise. However, the comparison may be incorrect if the deadline is not a whole number.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement and input format. It is also important to carefully check your calculations and make sure that they are correct.

CODEFORCES 130_A. Hexagonal numbers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect formula.** The formula for the nth hexagonal number is hn = 2n2 - n, not hn = 2n2 + n.
2. **Off-by-one error.** The nth hexagonal number is hn = 2n2 - n, so the nth hexagonal number is one less than the formula 2n2 + n would suggest.
3. **Using the wrong type.** The nth hexagonal number is an integer, so it should be calculated and output as an integer.
4. **Not handling negative numbers.** The formula for the nth hexagonal number only applies to positive integers, so an error should be raised if a negative number is passed as input.
5. **Not handling inputs that are too large.** The formula for the nth hexagonal number can only be used to calculate hexagonal numbers up to a certain size. If an input is larger than this size, an error should be raised.

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always strictly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may be separated by commas instead of spaces.
2. **Incorrect variable types**. The program may not be able to handle input data of the wrong type. For example, the input may contain strings instead of numbers, or the numbers may be too large.
3. **Incorrect calculations**. The program may make mistakes in its calculations, such as dividing by zero or taking the square root of a negative number.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The program may not output the correct answer in the correct format. For example, the answer may be in the wrong case, or it may contain extra spaces.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1371_D. Grid-00100

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very clear. It is not clear whether the input should be a single line with two integers n and k, or two lines, one with n and one with k. This can lead to errors if the developer does not correctly parse the input.

**2. Incorrect calculation of f(A)**

The formula for f(A) is not very intuitive, and it is easy to make mistakes when calculating it. For example, the developer might forget to square the differences between the maximum and minimum values of R and C.

**3. Incorrect construction of the grid**

Once the developer has calculated f(A), they need to construct a grid that satisfies the constraints of the problem. This can be tricky, as the developer needs to make sure that the sum of all elements in the grid is equal to k, and that the values of R and C are as close to each other as possible.

**4. Incorrect output**

The output for this problem is a bit tricky, as the developer needs to print the minimum possible value of f(A), followed by the grid itself. It is easy to make mistakes when formatting the output, or when printing the grid itself.

**5. Runtime errors**

This problem can be solved in O(n^2), but the developer might accidentally write an inefficient algorithm that takes O(n^3) or even O(n^4) time. This can lead to the program running out of time, or to the developer getting incorrect results.

**6. Memory errors**

This problem does not require a lot of memory, but the developer might accidentally allocate too much memory, or they might not free memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to the program crashing, or to the developer getting incorrect results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1394_A. Boboniu Chats with Du

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is `n, d, m`, where `n` is the number of days, `d` is the number of days Boboniu will muzzle Du, and `m` is Boboniu's mood. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output of the program should be a single integer, which is the maximum total fun factor. If the output format is incorrect, the program will get a wrong answer.

**3. Overflow**

The fun factor of each day can be up to `10^9`, and the number of days can be up to `10^5`. So the total fun factor can be up to `10^14`, which is larger than the integer type that most programming languages support. To avoid overflow, we can use long long type in C++ or Java, or BigInteger in Python.

**4. Incorrect calculation of the maximum total fun factor**

The maximum total fun factor is the sum of the fun factors on the days when Du can speak. To calculate the maximum total fun factor, we need to consider all possible permutations of the array `a`. One way to do this is to use the backtracking algorithm.

**5. Time complexity**

The backtracking algorithm has a time complexity of `O(n!)`, which is too slow for large `n`. To improve the time complexity, we can use the dynamic programming algorithm. The dynamic programming algorithm has a time complexity of `O(n^2)`, which is much faster than the backtracking algorithm.

**6. Space complexity**

The backtracking algorithm has a space complexity of `O(n)`, which is too large for large `n`. To reduce the space complexity, we can use the bottom-up dynamic programming algorithm. The bottom-up dynamic programming algorithm has a space complexity of `O(1)`.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program. For example, if the output contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program does not consider all possible cases, it may output incorrect results.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program may not properly release memory that it has allocated, which may lead to a memory leak. This can eventually cause the program to crash.
5. **Synchronization issues**. The program may not be properly synchronized, which may lead to errors. For example, if two threads try to access the same data at the same time, it may lead to data corruption.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may contain security vulnerabilities, which may allow attackers to gain access to the program's data or system. For example, if the program does not properly validate user input, it may allow attackers to inject malicious code into the program.

CODEFORCES 1436_E. Complicated Computations

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect array definition**. The input array must be a list of integers. If the input array is not a list of integers, the program will throw an error.
2. **Incorrect MEX definition**. The MEX of an array is the smallest positive integer that is not in the array. If the array contains all positive integers, the MEX of the array is 1.
3. **Incorrect subarray definition**. A subarray of an array is a contiguous sequence of elements from the array. If the input array is not a contiguous sequence of elements, the program will throw an error.
4. **Incorrect MEX of subarrays calculation**. The MEX of a subarray is the smallest positive integer that is not in the subarray. If the subarray contains all positive integers, the MEX of the subarray is 1.
5. **Incorrect output**. The output must be a single integer. If the output is not a single integer, the program will throw an error.

To avoid these problems, make sure that the input array is a list of integers, that the MEX of an array is the smallest positive integer that is not in the array, that the subarray of an array is a contiguous sequence of elements from the array, that the MEX of a subarray is the smallest positive integer that is not in the subarray, and that the output is a single integer.

CODEFORCES 1461_C. Random Events

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading in the data. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the input parser will likely fail.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm:** The algorithm for solving this problem is fairly straightforward, but it is easy to make a mistake when implementing it. For example, you might forget to update the state of the permutation after each experiment, or you might not correctly account for the fact that the experiments are performed in a specific order.
3. **Incorrect error handling:** It is important to handle errors correctly in any program, but it is especially important in a competitive programming contest. For example, if you try to divide by zero, your program will likely crash.
4. **Time complexity:** The time complexity of your algorithm is very important in a competitive programming contest. If your algorithm is too slow, it will not be able to finish in time, and you will receive a negative score.
5. **Memory usage:** The memory usage of your algorithm is also important in a competitive programming contest. If your algorithm uses too much memory, it will be disqualified.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand the input format and the output format. You should also carefully implement the algorithm and test it thoroughly before submitting it to the contest. Finally, you should be aware of the time and memory constraints of the problem and design your algorithm accordingly.

CODEFORCES 1486_D. Max Median

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain a negative number or a number that is too large.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the output may contain a non-integer number or a number that is too large.
3. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not find the maximum median or may find a median that is not the largest possible.
4. **Incorrect data structures.** The data structures used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the data structures may not be able to store the input data or may not be able to efficiently find the maximum median.
5. **Incorrect implementation.** The implementation of the algorithm may be incorrect. For example, the implementation may contain bugs that cause the algorithm to crash or to produce incorrect results.
6. **Incorrect testing.** The testing of the algorithm may be incorrect. For example, the tests may not test all possible cases or may not test the algorithm in a way that is representative of its real-world use.
7. **Incorrect debugging.** The debugging of the algorithm may be incorrect. For example, the debugger may not be able to find the bug or may not be able to identify the cause of the bug.
8. **Incorrect documentation.** The documentation of the algorithm may be incorrect. For example, the documentation may not be clear or may not be complete.
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect input format.**

```
1 1
1
```

This input is incorrect because it does not have two integers n and k.

2. **Incorrect output format.**

```
5 3
1 2 3 2 1
4
```

This output is incorrect because it is not an integer.

3. **Incorrect algorithm.**

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

def find_median(a):
  a.sort()
  return a[int((len(a) - 1) / 2)]

max_median = -1
for i in range(n - k + 1):
  max_median = max(max_median, find_median(a[i:i + k]))

print(max_median)
```

This algorithm is incorrect because it does not consider all possible subarrays. For example, in the input `5 3
1 2 3 2 1`, the algorithm will only consider the subarrays `[1..3]`, `[1..4]`, and `[2..4]`, but it will not consider the subarray `[3..5]`, which has a larger median.

4. **Incorrect data structures.**

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

def find_median(a):
  a.sort()
  return a[int((len(a) - 1) / 2)]

max_median = -1
for i in range(n - k + 1):
  max_median = max(max_median, find_median(a[i:i + k]))

print(max_median)
```

This code uses a list to store the input data, which is inefficient because it requires O(n) time to sort the list. A more efficient data structure would be a heap, which can sort the data in O(n log n) time.

5. **Incorrect implementation.**

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

def find_median(a):
  a.sort()
  return a[int((len(a) - 1) / 2)]

max_median = -1
for i in range(n - k + 1):
  max_median = max(max_median, find_median(a[i:i + k]))

print(max_median)
```

This code contains a bug in the `find_median` function. The function should return the element at index `int((len(a) - 1) / 2)`, but it is returning the element at index `int(len(a) / 2)`. This bug will cause the algorithm to return the wrong median.

6. **Incorrect testing.**

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

def find_median(a):
  a.sort()
  return a[int((len(a) - 1) / 2)]

max_median = -1
for i in range(n - k + 1):
  max_median = max(max_median, find_median(a[i:i + k]))

print(max_median)
```

This code does not test the algorithm for all possible inputs. For example, it does not test the algorithm for inputs where k is greater than n.

7. **Incorrect debugging.**

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

def find_median(a):
  a.sort()
  return a[int((len(a) - 1) / 2)]

max_median = -1
for i in range(n - k + 1):
  max_median = max(max_median, find_median(a[i:i + k]))

print(max_median)
```

This code does not use any debugging techniques, such as print statements or breakpoints, to help identify the bug.

8. **Incorrect documentation.**

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list

CODEFORCES 1536_F. Omkar and Akmar

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect modulo operation**

When calculating the modulo of a large number, it is important to use the correct modulo operator. For example, in Python, the modulo operator `%` returns the remainder of the division, while the operator `//` returns the quotient. If you accidentally use the `%` operator when you should be using the `//` operator, you will get the wrong answer.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when you forget to account for the first or last element in a list or array. For example, if you are iterating over a list of numbers and you forget to add 1 to the index of the last element, you will miss that element.

**3. Array out-of-bounds errors**

Array out-of-bounds errors occur when you try to access an element of an array that is outside of the bounds of the array. This can happen if you accidentally index the array with a negative number, or if you index the array with a number that is greater than the length of the array.

**4. Incorrect variable initialization**

It is important to initialize variables correctly before using them. For example, if you declare a variable but do not initialize it, the variable will be assigned the default value of `0`. This can lead to errors if you are expecting the variable to have a different value.

**5. Using the wrong data type**

It is important to use the correct data type for your variables. For example, if you are storing a number that is greater than 255, you should use the `int` data type instead of the `char` data type. Using the wrong data type can lead to errors when you try to perform arithmetic operations on the variables.

**6. Using uninitialized variables**

It is important to initialize variables before using them. If you use an uninitialized variable, the value of the variable will be unpredictable. This can lead to errors in your program.

**7. Forgetting to check for errors**

It is important to check for errors in your code. For example, if you are calling a function that can return an error, you should check the return value of the function to make sure that it did not fail. If you do not check for errors, your program may crash or produce incorrect results.
Test inputs:
**1. Incorrect modulo operation**

```
>>> 10 % 100
10
```

This is incorrect because the modulo operator `%` returns the remainder of the division, while the operator `//` returns the quotient. In this case, the correct answer is 0.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

```
>>> list(range(1, 5))
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

This list is missing the number 0. This is because the range function starts at 1 and ends at 4, which is one less than the length of the list.

**3. Array out-of-bounds errors**

```
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> a[4]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range
```

This error occurs because the index 4 is out of bounds for the array a, which has only 3 elements.

**4. Incorrect variable initialization**

```
>>> a = 5
>>> b = a
>>> a = 10
>>> b
5
```

This is incorrect because the variable b is still assigned the value of 5, even though the variable a has been reassigned to the value of 10.

**5. Using the wrong data type**

```
>>> a = '10'
>>> type(a)
<class 'str'>
```

This variable is a string, not an integer. This can lead to errors when you try to perform arithmetic operations on the variable.

**6. Using uninitialized variables**

```
>>> a = b
>>> b = 10
>>> a
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'a' is not defined
```

This error occurs because the variable a has not been initialized. This can lead to errors in your program.

**7. Forgetting to check for errors**

```
>>> open('file.txt')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'file.txt'
```

This error occurs because the file `file.txt` does not exist. This can lead to errors in your program if you try to open the file.

CODEFORCES 185_A. Plant

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n. However, a developer may accidentally read in multiple integers or other data types. This could lead to incorrect results or a segmentation fault.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of plants.** The problem statement states that after one year, a triangle plant directed "upwards" divides into four triangle plants: three of them will point "upwards" and one will point "downwards". After another year, each triangle plant divides into four triangle plants: three of them will be directed in the same direction as the parent plant, and one of them will be directed in the opposite direction. Then each year the process repeats. This means that the number of plants that point "upwards" will double every year. A developer may accidentally calculate the number of plants incorrectly, leading to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect modulo operation.** The problem statement specifies that the output should be the remainder of dividing the number of plants that will point "upwards" in n years by 1000000007 (109 + 7). A developer may accidentally perform the modulo operation incorrectly, leading to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect use of the %lld specifier.** The problem statement specifies that the input and output should be 64-bit integers. However, a developer may accidentally use the %lld specifier, which is only supported for C++11 and later. This could lead to incorrect results or a compiler error.
5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other potential bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:
    * Memory errors
    * Logic errors
    * Runtime errors
    * Syntax errors

By following the tips below, you can help to avoid these common problems and bugs:

* **Use the correct input format.** Make sure that you are reading in the input data in the correct format. This will help to ensure that you are getting the correct results.
* **Calculate the number of plants correctly.** Make sure that you are correctly calculating the number of plants that will point "upwards" in each year. This will help to ensure that you are getting the correct results.
* **Perform the modulo operation correctly.** Make sure that you are correctly performing the modulo operation to get the remainder of dividing the number of plants by 1000000007 (109 + 7). This will help to ensure that you are getting the correct results.
* **Use the correct specifiers.** Make sure that you are using the correct specifiers for the input and output data. This will help to avoid compiler errors and incorrect results.
* **Test your code thoroughly.** Once you have written your code, test it thoroughly to make sure that it is working correctly. This will help to catch any bugs before you submit your solution.

2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values must be correct. For example, if the coordinates of the babies are given as strings, the program will not be able to process them correctly.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are common when programming, and they can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program checks if two points are equal by comparing their x-coordinates, it will not work correctly if the points have different y-coordinates.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be correct. For example, if the program checks if a rectangle exists by checking if all of its sides are covered by babies, it will not work correctly if a baby overlaps two sides of the rectangle.
5. **Infinite loops**. Infinite loops can occur if the program does not have any way to terminate. For example, if the program is constantly checking if a rectangle exists, it will never terminate.
6. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks can occur when the program does not free up memory that it is no longer using. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can occur when the program does not properly check the input data. For example, if the program allows users to input arbitrary code, it could be exploited by attackers to run malicious code on the system.
8. **Performance issues**. The program's performance can be affected by a number of factors, including the data structures used, the algorithms used, and the programming language used. For example, a program that uses a linked list to store data will be slower than a program that uses a hash table.

Title:
CODEFORCES 631_A. Interview

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the bitwise OR operator.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. Make sure that you are using the correct operator for your programming language. For example, in Python, the bitwise OR operator is `|`, while in C++, it is `|`.
2. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** When performing bitwise operations on large integers, it is important to be aware of the possibility of overflow. This can occur when the result of an operation is larger than the maximum representable value for the data type. To avoid overflow, you can use a signed integer type that is large enough to hold the results of your operations.
3. **Incorrect handling of negative numbers.** The bitwise OR operator does not work the same way on negative numbers as it does on positive numbers. For example, in Python, `-1 | -1` evaluates to `0`, while in C++, it evaluates to `-2`. Make sure that you are aware of the behavior of the bitwise OR operator on negative numbers and take it into account when writing your code.
4. **Incorrect handling of zeros.** The bitwise OR operator has a special behavior when one of its operands is zero. In Python, `0 | x` evaluates to `x`, while in C++, it evaluates to `x`. Make sure that you are aware of this behavior and take it into account when writing your code.
5. **Incorrect handling of empty arrays.** The bitwise OR operator does not work on empty arrays. If you try to perform a bitwise OR operation on an empty array, you will get an error. Make sure that you check for empty arrays before performing bitwise operations on them.
6. **Incorrect handling of invalid inputs.** The bitwise OR operator can only be applied to integers. If you try to perform a bitwise OR operation on a non-integer value, you will get an error. Make sure that you check for invalid inputs before performing bitwise operations on them.
7. **Incorrect use of the bitwise OR operator.** The bitwise OR operator is a powerful tool, but it can also be dangerous if used incorrectly. Make sure that you understand the behavior of the bitwise OR operator before using it in your code.

CODEFORCES 683_C. Symmetric Difference

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain the number of elements in the first set, followed by the elements of the set. The second line should contain the number of elements in the second set, followed by the elements of the set. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the program should print the number of elements in the symmetric difference of the two sets, followed by the elements of the symmetric difference separated by a space. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly output the results and will produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect data type.** The input data is given as a list of integers. The program must be able to correctly parse the input data and store it in the correct data type. If the data type is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly process the data and will produce incorrect output.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over the sets of numbers, it is important to make sure that the indices are correct. An off-by-one error can cause the program to skip or repeat elements of the sets, which will result in incorrect output.
5. **Logic errors.** The logic of the program must be correct in order to correctly find the symmetric difference of the two sets. If the logic is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly output the results.
6. **Memory errors.** The program must be careful not to allocate too much memory. If the program allocates too much memory, it may crash or cause other problems.
7. **Timeout errors.** The program must be able to complete its execution within a reasonable amount of time. If the program takes too long to execute, it may be terminated by the system.

CODEFORCES 706_B. Interesting drink

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the solution. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the solution may crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the solution. For example, if the output contains a number that is not an integer, the solution may crash.
3. **Incorrect data type.** The data type of the input and output values is not correctly specified, which may lead to errors in the solution. For example, if the input values are specified as strings, but the solution expects them to be integers, the solution may crash.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** The solution may incorrectly count the number of shops where Vasiliy can buy a bottle of the drink, resulting in an incorrect output. For example, if the solution counts the number of shops where Vasiliy can buy a bottle of the drink on the first day, but does not count the shop where Vasiliy can buy a bottle of the drink on the second day, the solution will output an incorrect answer.
5. **Memory leaks.** The solution may not properly release memory that it has allocated, which may lead to a memory leak. A memory leak can eventually cause the program to crash.
6. **Infinite loops.** The solution may enter an infinite loop, which will prevent the program from terminating. An infinite loop can be caused by a logic error in the solution.
7. **Incorrect algorithm.** The solution may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem, which will result in an incorrect output. For example, if the solution uses a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem, the solution will be very slow and may not be able to solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time.

CODEFORCES 772_D. Varying Kibibits

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the f(L) function.** The f(L) function should take in a non-empty list of integers and output another integer. However, the developer may accidentally implement the function to take in an empty list of integers, which will result in an incorrect output.
2. Incorrect implementation of the G(x) function. The G(x) function should take in an integer and output the sum of squares of sum of elements of nonempty subsequences of T that evaluate to x when plugged into f modulo 1 000 000 007, then multiplied by x. However, the developer may accidentally implement the function to output the sum of squares of sum of elements of all subsequences of T, which will result in an incorrect output.
3. Incorrect implementation of the bitwise XOR operator. The bitwise XOR operator takes in two integers and outputs a single integer that is the result of the bitwise exclusive OR operation on the two input integers. However, the developer may accidentally implement the operator to output the bitwise AND operation on the two input integers, which will result in an incorrect output.
4. Incorrect use of the modulo operator. The modulo operator takes in two integers and outputs a single integer that is the remainder of the first integer divided by the second integer. However, the developer may accidentally use the modulo operator incorrectly, which will result in an incorrect output.
5. Incorrect use of the factorial function. The factorial function takes in an integer and outputs the product of all positive integers less than or equal to the input integer. However, the developer may accidentally use the factorial function incorrectly, which will result in an incorrect output.
6. Incorrect use of the binomial coefficient function. The binomial coefficient function takes in two integers and outputs the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items. However, the developer may accidentally use the binomial coefficient function incorrectly, which will result in an incorrect output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 797_D. Broken BST

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the BST traversal algorithm.** The BST traversal algorithm should visit each node in the tree in a specific order: left, root, right. If the algorithm is not implemented correctly, it may visit nodes in the wrong order, which could lead to incorrect results.
2. **Using a non-binary search tree.** The BST traversal algorithm only works correctly on binary search trees. If the tree is not a binary search tree, the algorithm may visit nodes in the wrong order, which could lead to incorrect results.
3. **Using a tree with duplicate values.** The BST traversal algorithm assumes that each node in the tree has a unique value. If the tree contains duplicate values, the algorithm may visit the same node multiple times, which could lead to incorrect results.
4. **Using a tree with a cycle.** A cycle in a tree is a path that starts and ends at the same node. If the tree contains a cycle, the BST traversal algorithm may get stuck in an infinite loop, which could lead to incorrect results.
5. **Using a tree with a disconnected subtree.** A disconnected subtree is a subtree that is not connected to the rest of the tree. If the tree contains a disconnected subtree, the BST traversal algorithm may not visit all of the nodes in the tree, which could lead to incorrect results.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully implement the BST traversal algorithm and to use a tree that is a binary search tree, does not contain duplicate values, does not contain cycles, and does not contain disconnected subtrees.

CODEFORCES 817_F. MEX Queries

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly handling queries of type 3.** In the problem statement, it is mentioned that "Invert the interval [l, r] — add all missing and remove all present numbers from the interval [l, r]". However, some solutions incorrectly implement this by only adding the missing numbers from the interval [l, r]. This can lead to incorrect results, as it is possible for a number to be both missing from the set and present in the interval [l, r].
2. **Using an incorrect data structure to store the set.** The problem statement does not specify what data structure should be used to store the set. Some solutions incorrectly use a data structure that does not support efficient insertion and deletion of elements, which can lead to slow performance.
3. **Not handling overflows correctly.** The problem statement states that "MEX ≥ 1", which means that the MEX of the set must be a positive integer. However, some solutions incorrectly handle overflows, which can lead to the MEX being a negative integer or a very large integer.
4. **Not handling duplicate elements correctly.** The problem statement does not specify how duplicate elements should be handled. Some solutions incorrectly handle duplicate elements by adding them to the set multiple times, which can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Not handling empty sets correctly.** The problem statement does not specify how empty sets should be handled. Some solutions incorrectly handle empty sets by returning a MEX of 0, which is incorrect.
6. **Not handling invalid queries correctly.** The problem statement states that "1 ≤ t ≤ 3, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 1018". Some solutions incorrectly handle invalid queries, such as queries with t < 1 or t > 3, or queries with l > r. This can lead to incorrect results or runtime errors.

Title:
CODEFORCES 889_C. Maximum Element

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**

The modulo operator is used to find the remainder of a division. For example, `10 % 3` is equal to 1, because 10 divided by 3 has a remainder of 1.

In this problem, the modulo operator is used to ensure that the answer is a number between 0 and 109 + 7. However, if you accidentally use the wrong modulo operator, the answer may be incorrect.

For example, if you use the modulo operator `% 109`, the answer to the problem `5 2` would be 23, instead of 22.

**2. Using the wrong data type**

The data type of a variable determines the range of values that it can store. For example, an integer variable can store whole numbers, while a floating-point variable can store decimal numbers.

In this problem, the input data is two integers, n and k. If you accidentally use the wrong data type for these variables, the code may not work correctly.

For example, if you use a floating-point variable for n, the code may not be able to handle the case where n is equal to 109 + 1.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve a problem is critical to the correctness of the solution. In this problem, the algorithm used to find the number of permutations of integers from 1 to n such that the return value of the function is not equal to n is incorrect.

The correct algorithm is as follows:

1. Iterate over all permutations of integers from 1 to n.
2. For each permutation, check if the return value of the function is equal to n.
3. If the return value of the function is not equal to n, increment the count of permutations that do not have the return value equal to n.

**4. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

The boundary conditions of a problem are the conditions that must be met for the problem to be solved correctly. In this problem, the boundary conditions are that n and k must be positive integers.

If you accidentally use incorrect boundary conditions, the code may not work correctly.

For example, if you allow n to be negative, the code may not be able to handle the case where n is equal to -1.

**5. Using incorrect variable names**

The names of variables should be descriptive and easy to understand. In this problem, the names of the variables n and k are descriptive and easy to understand.

However, if you use incorrect variable names, the code may be difficult to read and understand.

For example, if you use the variable names `a` and `b` for n and k, the code would be difficult to read and understand.

**6. Using incorrect indentation**

The indentation of code is important for readability. In this problem, the indentation is correct.

However, if you use incorrect indentation, the code may be difficult to read and understand.

For example, if you indent the code incorrectly, the code would be difficult to read and understand.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a character that is not a digit.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may contain a character that is not a digit.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the number of crystals needed to produce the required number of balls. For example, the developer may forget to account for the fact that a green ball requires one yellow and one blue crystal.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may make an off-by-one error when calculating the number of crystals needed to produce the required number of balls. For example, the developer may calculate that 5 yellow crystals are needed to produce 2 yellow balls, when in fact only 4 yellow crystals are needed.
5. **Arithmetic overflow**. The developer may encounter an arithmetic overflow when calculating the number of crystals needed to produce the required number of balls. For example, the developer may try to calculate the number of crystals needed to produce 100 billion yellow balls, when the maximum value of an integer is only 2147483647.

Title:
CODEFORCES 987_F. AND Graph

Pain points:
 1. **Incorrect use of bitwise operators.** The bitwise AND operator (`&`) is used to perform a logical AND operation on two operands. This means that the result of the operation will be 1 if both operands are 1, and 0 otherwise. In the problem statement, we are told to connect two integers `x` and `y` with an edge if and only if `x & y = 0`. This means that we should only connect two integers if they have all of the same bits set. However, some developers may incorrectly use the bitwise OR operator (`|`), which will connect two integers if they have any of the same bits set. This will result in a incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect use of the set data structure.** The set data structure is used to store a collection of unique elements. In the problem statement, we are told that the set contains `m` integers between 0 and `2^n`-1. This means that the set should contain at most `2^n` elements. However, some developers may incorrectly use the set data structure to store more than `2^n` elements. This will result in a runtime error.
3. **Incorrect use of the Union-Find data structure.** The Union-Find data structure is used to find the connected components of a graph. In the problem statement, we are told to count the number of connected components in the graph. This means that we need to use the Union-Find data structure to find all of the connected components. However, some developers may incorrectly use the Union-Find data structure to find the number of edges in the graph. This will result in a incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect use of the DFS algorithm.** The DFS algorithm is used to traverse a graph. In the problem statement, we are told to count the number of connected components in the graph. This means that we need to use the DFS algorithm to find all of the connected components. However, some developers may incorrectly use the DFS algorithm to find the shortest path in the graph. This will result in a incorrect answer.

Title:
HACKEREARTH alook-and-magic-spells

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The problem statement mentions that the input is an integer, but the code below is expecting a string. This will cause a type error.
2. **Incorrect variable name**. The problem statement uses the variable name `n` to represent the length of the spell, but the code below uses the variable name `i`. This will cause a name collision error.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The problem statement states that the number of phonetically different spells is equal to the number of lexicographically different spells multiplied by the number of phonetic variations. However, the code below is only multiplying the number of lexicographically different spells by 2. This will result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect modulo operator**. The problem statement states that the answer should be modulo 10^9 + 7. However, the code below is using the modulo operator `%` instead of the modulus operator `//`. This will result in an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect output format**. The problem statement states that the output should be a single line containing the answer. However, the code below is printing the answer on multiple lines. This will cause a formatting error.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that your code is correct. You should also use the correct variable types, variable names, and operators. Finally, you should make sure that your output format is correct.

HACKEREARTH cakewalk-3

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not very clear.**

The input format is not very clear. It is not clear what the input should be and what the output should be. For example, the input format says that the first line contains the integer 'N' denoting the number of words in the dictionary. But it is not clear what the second line should contain. Is it the first word of the dictionary? Or is it something else?

**2. The output format is not very clear.**

The output format is also not very clear. It is not clear what the output should be. For example, the output says that the output should be a single string that is the last resulting word of the given dictionary. But it is not clear what the last resulting word is.

**3. The problem is not well-defined.**

The problem is not well-defined. It is not clear what the goal of the problem is. For example, the problem says that we need to represent the dictionary in a compressed form. But it is not clear what the compressed form is.

**4. The problem is too easy.**

The problem is too easy. The problem can be solved by a simple brute-force algorithm.

**5. The problem is too hard.**

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of `cin` or `scanf`.** The `cin` and `scanf` functions are used to read input from the console. However, they can only read a single word at a time. If you try to use them to read a string, you will get an error. To read a string, you need to use the `getline` function.
2. **Incorrect use of `strlen`.** The `strlen` function returns the length of a string. However, it only works on strings that are stored in memory. If you try to use it on a string that is stored in a file, you will get an error. To get the length of a string that is stored in a file, you need to use the `fseek` and `ftell` functions.
3. **Incorrect use of `strcat` or `strncat`.** The `strcat` and `strncat` functions are used to concatenate two strings. However, they can only concatenate strings that are stored in memory. If you try to use them to concatenate strings that are stored in different files, you will get an error. To concatenate strings that are stored in different files, you need to use the `fopen` and `fputs` functions.
4. **Incorrect use of `strcmp` or `strncmp`.** The `strcmp` and `strncmp` functions are used to compare two strings. However, they can only compare strings that are stored in memory. If you try to use them to compare strings that are stored in different files, you will get an error. To compare strings that are stored in different files, you need to use the `fopen` and `fgets` functions.
5. **Incorrect use of `strcpy` or `strncpy`.** The `strcpy` and `strncpy` functions are used to copy one string to another. However, they can only copy strings that are stored in memory. If you try to use them to copy strings that are stored in different files, you will get an error. To copy strings that are stored in different files, you need to use the `fopen` and `fread` functions.

Title:
HACKEREARTH use-bit

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input string is a sequence of characters, so it should be stored as a string. If it is stored as a list or a tuple, the permutations will not be correct.

**2. Not considering the order of the characters**

The permutations of a string must be generated in lexicographical order. This means that the first permutation should be the string itself, followed by the strings with the first character swapped with each of the other characters, and so on.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

There are many different algorithms for generating permutations. The most efficient algorithm is the recursive backtracking algorithm. Other algorithms, such as the brute-force algorithm, are much slower.

**4. Not handling errors correctly**

The input string may contain invalid characters. If the input string is not valid, the program should raise an exception.

**5. Not handling the case of an empty string**

The input string may be empty. If the input string is empty, the program should print an empty line.

Title:
ATCODER p02990 AtCoder Beginner Contest 132 - Blue and Red Balls

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input contains two integers, N and K. N and K are both non-negative integers and are less than 2000. However, if you accidentally use an integer type that is too small, you may get an overflow error. For example, if you use a 32-bit integer, you will get an overflow error when N = 2000 and K = 1999.

To avoid this problem, you should use a data type that is large enough to store N and K. For example, you can use a 64-bit integer.

**2. Using incorrect modulo arithmetic**

The output should be modulo 10^9+7. This means that you need to perform all calculations modulo 10^9+7. If you accidentally forget to do this, you may get the wrong answer.

To avoid this problem, you should always perform all calculations modulo 10^9+7. You can do this by using the % operator. For example, if you want to calculate a*b modulo 10^9+7, you can use the following code:

```
a %= 10**9+7
b %= 10**9+7
c = a*b
c %= 10**9+7
```

**3. Using incorrect factorials**

The factorial of a number n is the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.

When calculating the factorial of a large number, you may get an overflow error. To avoid this problem, you can use the following formula:

```
n! = (n+1)!/(n+1)
```

For example, the factorial of 5 can be calculated as follows:

```
5! = (5+1)!/(5+1) = 6!/6 = 720/6 = 120
```

**4. Using incorrect dynamic programming**

Dynamic programming is a technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems. This can be a very efficient way to solve problems, but it is important to make sure that you are using the correct dynamic programming approach.

For example, the problem of finding the number of ways to arrange N balls in a row so that Takahashi will need exactly i moves to collect all the blue balls can be solved using dynamic programming. However, if you accidentally use the wrong dynamic programming approach, you may get the wrong answer.

To avoid this problem, you should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand the problem before you start coding. You should also carefully review your code to make sure that you are using the correct dynamic programming approach.
Test inputs:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

Title:
ATCODER p03131 Yahoo Programming Contest 2019 - When I hit my pocket...

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm.** The greedy algorithm for this problem is to always exchange biscuits for yen when possible, and then hit the pocket when there are no more biscuits. However, if the number of biscuits is less than the number of yen, then it is better to hit the pocket first to increase the number of biscuits, and then exchange biscuits for yen.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of biscuits.** The maximum number of biscuits is the minimum of the number of biscuits after hitting the pocket K times, and the number of biscuits after exchanging all of the yen for biscuits.
3. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The number of biscuits and yen can be very large, so it is important to use a data type that can represent these values without overflow.
4. **Incorrect input handling.** The input can contain very large numbers, so it is important to read the input carefully and make sure that it is valid.
5. **Incorrect output formatting.** The output should be formatted correctly, according to the problem statement.

Title:
ATCODER p03274 AtCoder Beginner Contest 107 - Candles

Pain points:
**1. Not handling the case where K is greater than N**

The problem states that K is at most N, but a developer may accidentally forget to check this and assume that K is always less than or equal to N. This could lead to an incorrect solution.

**2. Not handling the case where all of the candles are on the same side of the origin**

The problem states that the candles are placed on a number line, and that they are ordered from left to right. However, a developer may accidentally assume that the candles are not all on the same side of the origin. This could lead to an incorrect solution.

**3. Not handling the case where there are no candles to light**

The problem states that Snuke decides to light K of the N candles. However, a developer may accidentally forget to check if K is greater than 0. This could lead to an incorrect solution.

**4. Not handling the case where there are no candles between two consecutive candles**

The problem states that Snuke can move left and right along the line with speed 1. However, a developer may accidentally assume that there is always a candle between two consecutive candles. This could lead to an incorrect solution.

**5. Not handling the case where the candles are not distinct**

The problem states that the candles are ordered from left to right. However, a developer may accidentally assume that the candles are distinct. This could lead to an incorrect solution.

ATCODER p03431 AtCoder Grand Contest 021 - Ball Eat Chameleons

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulo operation.** The modulo operation is often used in programming contests, and it is easy to make mistakes. For example, `(a + b) % c` is not the same as `a % c + b % c`. Make sure you understand the difference between these two operations.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of mistake that can occur when programming. For example, if you are counting the number of elements in an array, you might accidentally count one element too many or one element too few.
3. **Indexing errors.** Indexing errors occur when you access an element of an array or list using an incorrect index. For example, if you try to access the element at index `n` in an array of size `n - 1`, you will get an error.
4. **Arithmetic errors.** Arithmetic errors occur when you make a mistake in your calculations. For example, if you add two numbers together and get the wrong answer, you have made an arithmetic error.
5. **Logical errors.** Logical errors occur when your program does not behave the way you intended it to. For example, if you write a program to sort a list of numbers, but the list is not sorted correctly, you have made a logical error.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. **Test your code carefully.** One of the best ways to find bugs in your code is to test it thoroughly. Write a variety of test cases, and make sure that your code produces the correct output for each case.
2. **Use a debugger.** A debugger can help you track down bugs in your code. It can show you the values of variables at different points in your program, and it can help you identify the source of errors.
3. **Ask for help.** If you are stuck on a bug, don't be afraid to ask for help. There are many online resources available, such as forums and chat rooms, where you can get help from other programmers.

Title:
ATCODER p03590 Tenka1 Programmer Beginner Contest - IntegerotS

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of binary search**

The binary search algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that can be used to find the position of a target value in a sorted array. However, if the implementation of the binary search algorithm is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results.

For example, the following is an incorrect implementation of the binary search algorithm:

```python
def binary_search(array, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(array) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if array[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif array[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

This implementation of the binary search algorithm has a bug because it does not check if the left and right pointers have crossed. This can lead to incorrect results if the target value is not in the array.

To fix this bug, we can add the following check to the binary search algorithm:

```python
def binary_search(array, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(array) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if array[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif array[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if left > right:
        return -1
```

This modified implementation of the binary search algorithm will correctly find the position of the target value in the array, or return -1 if the target value is not in the array.

**2. Using the wrong data type**

Another common mistake that developers make when solving problems with binary search is using the wrong data type. For example, if the input array is of type `int`, but the target value is of type `float`, the binary search algorithm will not work correctly.

To avoid this problem, it is important to use the same data type for both the input array and the target value. For example, if the input array is of type `int`, the target value should also be of type `int`.

**3. Using an incorrect comparison operator**

The binary search algorithm uses the `<=` operator to compare the target value with the values in the array. However, if the comparison operator is incorrect, the binary search algorithm will not work correctly.

For example, the following is an incorrect implementation of the binary search algorithm:

```python
def binary_search(array, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(array) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if array[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif array[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

This implementation of the binary search algorithm uses the `<` operator to compare the target value with the values in the array. This is incorrect because the binary search algorithm should use the `<=` operator.

To fix this bug, we can change the `<` operator to the `<=` operator:

```python
def binary_search(array, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(array) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if array[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif array[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

This modified implementation of the binary search algorithm will now work correctly.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

Another common mistake that developers make when solving problems with binary search is not handling edge cases. For example, if the input array is empty, the binary search algorithm will not work correctly.

To avoid this problem, it is important to handle edge cases in the binary search algorithm. For example, if the input array is empty, the binary search algorithm should return -1.

**5. Using an inefficient data structure**

The binary search algorithm is a very efficient algorithm, but it can be made even more efficient by using an efficient data structure. For

Title:
ATCODER p03747 AtCoder Grand Contest 013 - Ants on a Circle

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect calculation of the number of steps each ant takes.**

When two ants collide, they both turn around and start walking in the opposite direction. This means that the number of steps each ant takes after the collision is equal to the number of steps they would have taken if they had not collided, plus one. However, some developers may forget to add this extra step, which can lead to incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect handling of ants that collide at the same time.**

When two ants collide at the same time, they both turn around and start walking in the opposite direction. However, the order in which they turn around is not specified in the problem statement. This means that there are two possible outcomes:

* The first ant turns around, then the second ant turns around.
* The second ant turns around, then the first ant turns around.

In either case, the final positions of the ants will be the same. However, some developers may not realize this and incorrectly assume that the order in which the ants turn around matters. This can lead to incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect handling of ants that collide multiple times.**

It is possible for two ants to collide multiple times. In this case, the ants will continue to turn around and start walking in the opposite direction each time they collide. The final positions of the ants will be the same as if they had only collided once, but the number of steps they take will be different. Some developers may not realize this and incorrectly assume that the final positions of the ants will be the same regardless of how many times they collide. This can lead to incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect handling of ants that start at the same position.**

It is possible for two ants to start at the same position. In this case, the ants will collide immediately and both turn around. The final positions of the ants will be the same as if they had started at different positions. Some developers may not realize this and incorrectly assume that the final positions of the ants will be different if they start at the same position. This can lead to incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect handling of ants that start in opposite directions.**

It is possible for two ants to start in opposite directions. In this case, the ants will never collide. The final positions of the ants will be the same as if they had started in the same direction. Some developers may not realize this and incorrectly assume that the final positions of the ants will be different if they start in opposite directions. This can lead to incorrect results.

Title:
ATCODER p03909 CODE FESTIVAL 2016 Final - Where's Snuke?

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input is `1 2`, the program may expect the next two lines to contain the number of rows and columns, respectively. However, if the next line contains the string `snuke`, the program may crash because it is expecting an integer.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong data type, which may also cause the program to crash. For example, if the input is `1 2 3`, the program may expect the first two numbers to be integers, but the third number is a string. The program may then try to convert the string to an integer, which will cause an error.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program may have incorrect logic, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may not correctly find the square that contains the string `snuke`. This may happen if the program does not consider all possible squares, or if it does not correctly compare the strings in the squares.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The program may make off-by-one errors, which may cause it to miss the square that contains the string `snuke`. This may happen if the program does not correctly calculate the row and column indices of the square.
5. **Memory errors**. The program may run out of memory, which may cause it to crash. This may happen if the program needs to store a large amount of data, or if it does not correctly free up memory after it is no longer needed.
6. **Timeout errors**. The program may take too long to run, which may cause it to time out. This may happen if the program is inefficient, or if it is running on a slow computer.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may have security vulnerabilities, which may allow attackers to exploit the program to gain unauthorized access to the system. This may happen if the program does not correctly validate user input, or if it does not correctly handle errors.

Here are some of the most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for finding the minimum r such that the number of students who cannot participate in any group is x or less is not correct. This could lead to incorrect results being output.
* **Incorrect input handling.** The input data may not be formatted correctly, or it may contain invalid values. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
* **Memory leaks.** The program may not properly release memory that it has allocated. This could lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
* **Race conditions.** The program may not be thread-safe, which could lead to incorrect results being produced if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.
* **Incorrect error handling.** The program may not handle errors properly. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect calculation.** The developer may make a mistake when calculating the maximum sum of two numbers. For example, the developer may forget to add the two numbers together, or the developer may add the numbers in the wrong order. The developer should carefully check their calculations to make sure that they are correct.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** The developer may accidentally add or subtract one from a number when calculating the maximum sum. This can lead to incorrect results. The developer should carefully check their calculations to make sure that they do not make any off-by-one errors.
4. **Memory leaks.** The developer may create a memory leak when allocating memory for the input numbers. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash. The developer should use a memory management technique to avoid memory leaks.
5. **Infinite loops.** The developer may create an infinite loop when calculating the maximum sum. This can happen if the developer does not check for a terminating condition. The developer should carefully check their code to make sure that there are no infinite loops.

Pain points:
good 0.500
 **Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrectly calculating the deceleration rate.** The deceleration rate is the change in velocity per unit time, so it is important to correctly calculate the difference between the initial and final velocities and divide by the time interval.
* **Misunderstanding the problem statement.** The problem statement is very clear about the requirements for the program, so it is important to read it carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked.
* **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem, so it is important to choose one that is appropriate for the given constraints.
* **Making a mistake in the implementation.** Even the best algorithms can be implemented incorrectly, so it is important to carefully check your code for errors.
* **Not handling all of the possible cases.** The problem statement specifies a number of different cases that the program must be able to handle, so it is important to make sure that your code is able to handle all of them.

**Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrectly calculating the deceleration rate.** A developer might incorrectly calculate the deceleration rate by dividing the difference between the initial and final velocities by the total time interval. This would result in an incorrect answer.
* **Misunderstanding the problem statement.** A developer might misunderstand the problem statement and think that the goal is to stop the spaceship as quickly as possible. This would result in a program that does not meet the requirements of the problem.
* **Using an incorrect algorithm.** A developer might use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. This could result in a program that takes too long to run or that does not produce the correct answer.
* **Making a mistake in the implementation.** A developer might make a mistake in the implementation of their algorithm. This could result in a program that does not run correctly or that produces the wrong answer.
* **Not handling all of the possible cases.** A developer might not handle all of the possible cases that are specified in the problem statement. This could result in a program that crashes or that produces incorrect results.

Title:
AIZU p01335 K Poker

Pain points:
The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are:

1. **Incorrectly handling input data.** The input data for this problem is complex and can be easily misinterpreted. For example, the input data includes multiple lines of data, and each line of data can contain multiple values. A developer must be careful to parse the input data correctly and ensure that all of the values are correctly interpreted.
2. **Incorrectly implementing the game rules.** The game rules for K Poker are complex and can be easily misinterpreted. For example, the game rules specify that a straight can straddle an ace and a king, but it is considered a straight only if the hand is 10, jack, queen, king, or ace. A developer must be careful to implement the game rules correctly and ensure that all of the rules are enforced.
3. **Incorrectly calculating the hand score.** The hand score is calculated based on the cards in the hand and the game rules. A developer must be careful to correctly calculate the hand score and ensure that the score is correct.
4. **Incorrectly handling edge cases.** The input data for this problem may include edge cases that a developer must be prepared to handle. For example, the input data may include a hand that contains no cards of the same suit, or a hand that contains no cards of the same rank. A developer must be prepared to handle these edge cases and ensure that the program does not crash or produce incorrect output.
5. **Incorrectly using memory.** The program must be careful to use memory efficiently. For example, the program should not allocate more memory than is necessary and should release memory that is no longer needed.

By carefully considering these potential problems and bugs, a developer can write a program that correctly solves the K Poker problem.

Title:
AIZU p01502 Sightseeing Tour

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one errors.** The most common mistake is to forget to add 1 to the index when iterating over an array. This can lead to incorrect results, such as missing a city or visiting a city twice.
2. **Incorrect array indexing.** When accessing elements of an array, it is important to make sure that the index is within the bounds of the array. Otherwise, a `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` will be thrown.
3. **Incorrect array initialization.** When initializing an array, it is important to make sure that the array is the correct size. Otherwise, the array will not be able to store all of the data that is being passed to it.
4. **Incorrect data type conversions.** When converting data from one type to another, it is important to make sure that the conversion is done correctly. Otherwise, the data will be corrupted and the program will not work correctly.
5. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program must be correct in order for the program to work correctly. Any errors in the logic will lead to incorrect results.
6. **Uncaught exceptions.** If an exception is thrown and not caught, the program will terminate abnormally. This can lead to data loss or other problems.
7. **Memory leaks.** If a program does not properly release memory that it has allocated, it can eventually lead to a memory leak. This can slow down the program or even cause it to crash.
8. **Security vulnerabilities.** If a program is not properly secured, it can be exploited by attackers. This can lead to data theft, system compromise, or other problems.
9. **Poor performance.** The performance of a program can be affected by a number of factors, such as the algorithms that are used, the data structures that are used, and the programming language that is used.
10. **Usability problems.** A program that is not user-friendly can be difficult to use and understand. This can lead to user errors and other problems.
11. **Maintainability problems.** A program that is not well-maintained can be difficult to change and update. This can lead to problems when new features are added or when bugs are fixed.

Title:
AIZU p01950 Endless BFS

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input graph may not be a valid undirected graph. For example, it may contain self-loops or multi-edges.
* The input graph may not be connected. This means that there may be some vertices that are not reachable from the start vertex.
* Mr. Endo's wrong BFS code may not stop within finite steps. This can happen if the input graph contains a cycle.
* Mr. Endo's wrong BFS code may not explore all the vertices in the input graph. This can happen if the input graph is not connected.

To avoid these problems, we need to make sure that the input graph is a valid undirected graph and that it is connected. We also need to make sure that Mr. Endo's wrong BFS code stops within finite steps. If the input graph is not connected, we can simply return -1. If the input graph is connected, we can use a modified version of BFS to explore the graph and check if it stops within finite steps.

Title:
AIZU p02099 GPA JANKEN

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correct. For example, if the input is `1 1.000 2.000`, the program will crash because it expects the first line to be `N`.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correct. For example, if the output is `1 2 3`, the program will crash because it expects the output to be a list of numbers.
3. **Incorrect calculation of points**. The program may incorrectly calculate the points won by each player. For example, if the GPAs of two players are `1.0` and `2.0`, the program may incorrectly calculate that the player with GPA `1.0` won the game, even though the player with GPA `2.0` actually won.
4. **Incorrect handling of ties**. The program may incorrectly handle ties. For example, if the GPAs of two players are the same, the program may incorrectly calculate that both players won the game, even though no one actually won.
5. **Incorrect handling of errors**. The program may not handle errors correctly. For example, if the input is invalid, the program may not print an error message.
6. **Other bugs**. There may be other bugs in the program that are not listed here.

Title:
AIZU p02383 Dice I

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be a list of 6 integers, followed by a string of commands. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect command**. The commands should be one of 'E', 'N', 'S', or 'W'. If the command is incorrect, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer. If the output format is incorrect, the program will crash.
4. **Off-by-one error**. When calculating the new position of the dice, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. This can result in the dice ending up in the wrong position, or not moving at all.
5. **Memory leak**. If the program does not properly free up memory, it can eventually run out of memory and crash.
6. **Race condition**. If two threads are accessing the same data at the same time, it is possible for them to corrupt each other's data. This can lead to incorrect results or even a crash.
7. **Security vulnerability**. If the program is not properly secured, it can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system.
