Title:
CODECHEF cd1it5

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of integers, but the code is expecting a list of strings. This can be fixed by changing the type of the input data to a list of strings.

**2. Undefined variable**

The code is trying to access the variable `x` before it has been initialized. This can be fixed by initializing the variable before it is used.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The code is checking if the two islands are connected by a cable, but it is not taking into account the direction of the cable. This can be fixed by checking if either island is connected to the other island.

**4. Off-by-one error**

The code is checking if the two islands are connected by a cable, but it is not checking if the cable is bidirectional. This can be fixed by checking if both islands are connected to the other island.

**5. Memory leak**

The code is not releasing the memory that it allocates for the graph. This can be fixed by using the `delete` keyword to free up the memory.

CODECHEF cvote

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect data type:** The input data is given as strings, but the output should be a country name and a chef name. The developer may incorrectly cast the data types, resulting in an incorrect answer.
* **Off-by-one error:** The developer may incorrectly count the number of votes for each country or chef, resulting in an incorrect answer.
* **Incorrect use of lexicographical order:** The developer may incorrectly compare two strings using lexicographical order, resulting in an incorrect answer.
* **Incorrect use of the ASCII code:** The developer may incorrectly use the ASCII code to compare two strings, resulting in an incorrect answer.
* **Incorrect use of the standard comparator:** The developer may incorrectly use the standard comparator to compare two strings, resulting in an incorrect answer.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that they understand the input and output formats. They should also carefully check their code for errors, such as incorrect data types, off-by-one errors, and incorrect use of lexicographical order, the ASCII code, and the standard comparator.

CODEFORCES 1041_F. Ray in the tube

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm for solving this problem is not trivial, and it is easy to make a mistake in its implementation. For example, if you forget to check for overflows, the program may crash.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when printing the output. For example, if you print a number with the wrong precision, the judge will not accept your solution.
4. **Runtime error**. The program may run out of time if it is too slow. This can happen if the algorithm is inefficient or if the input data is large.
5. **Memory error**. The program may run out of memory if it allocates too much memory. This can happen if the input data is large or if the algorithm is inefficient.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test your code thoroughly with different input data sets.

CODEFORCES 1064_E. Dwarves, Hats and Extrasensory Abilities

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The first line of the input should contain an integer `n`. If `n` is not an integer or is less than 1 or greater than 30, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should contain four integers `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. If any of these integers is not an integer or is less than 0 or greater than 109, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect points**. The points that you name must be distinct. If two points have the same coordinates, the program will crash.
4. **Incorrect line**. The line that you draw must not pass through any of the points. If the line passes through any of the points, the program will crash.
5. **Not all points are separated**. The line that you draw must separate the points into two groups, one group of black points and one group of white points. If not all points are separated, the program will crash.

Here are some tips to avoid these problems:

1. Make sure that you understand the input format and output format.
2. Check your code carefully for errors.

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is not very clear. It is not clear what the format of the strings `s`, `a`, and `b` is. This could lead to the developer incorrectly parsing the input and getting incorrect results.
* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm:** The algorithm for solving this problem is not very straightforward. It is easy to make mistakes in the implementation, which could lead to incorrect results.
* **Incorrect handling of edge cases:** There are a few edge cases that the developer needs to be aware of when solving this problem. For example, what happens if the length of the template is not equal to the length of the strings `s`, `a`, and `b`? What happens if there is no template that satisfies the given constraints? The developer needs to make sure that they handle these edge cases correctly, or they will get incorrect results.

By being aware of these possible problems and bugs, developers can avoid them and write correct code to solve this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1106_C. Lunar New Year and Number Division

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**

The input format is "n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), denoting that there are n integers on Bob's homework paper.". However, the input may not be in this format. For example, the input may be "4 8 5 2 3". This will cause the program to crash.

**2. The output format is not correct**

The output format is "A single line containing one integer, denoting the minimum of the sum of the square of s_j, which is $$$∑_{i = j}^{m} s_j^2, where m$$$ is the number of groups.". However, the output may not be in this format. For example, the output may be "164 27". This will cause the program to crash.

**3. The program does not handle all possible cases**

The program may not handle all possible cases. For example, the program may not handle the case where the input is "1 1 1 2 2 2". This will cause the program to give an incorrect answer.

**4. The program is not efficient**

Title:
CODEFORCES 1133_D. Zero Quantity Maximization

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input contains integers, so you should use `int` or `long long` to store them. Using floating-point numbers may lead to incorrect results.

**2. Not considering the case where all elements of `a` are equal**

If all elements of `a` are equal, then the optimal value of `d` is `-b_min / a_min`, where `b_min` is the minimum element of `b`. If you don't consider this case, you may get a wrong answer.

**3. Not considering the case where all elements of `b` are equal**

If all elements of `b` are equal, then the optimal value of `d` is `0`. If you don't consider this case, you may get a wrong answer.

**4. Not considering the case where `a` and `b` are empty**

If `a` and `b` are empty, then the answer is 0. If you don't consider this case, you may get a wrong answer.

**5. Not handling overflows**

When calculating `d`, you need to be careful about overflows. For example, if `a_max` is very large and `b_min` is very small, then `d` may overflow. You can use the following code to avoid overflows:

```c++
long long a_max = *max_element(a.begin(), a.end());
long long b_min = *min_element(b.begin(), b.end());
double d = -b_min / a_max;
if (d < INT_MIN || d > INT_MAX) {
  // Handle overflow.
}
```
Test inputs:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

print(max(0, len(a) - abs(d)))

# Correct: using ints
d = -sum(b) // sum(a)
print(max(0, len(a) - abs(d)))
```

**2. Not considering the case where all elements of `a` are equal**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
b = list(map(int, input().split()))

if all(a[i] == a[0] for i in range(n)):

Title:
CODEFORCES 1194_E. Count The Rectangles

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

When reading the input, you may accidentally read the input as a string instead of an integer. This will cause the program to crash. To avoid this, make sure to use the `int()` function to cast the input to an integer.

**2. Off-by-one error**

When counting the number of rectangles, you may accidentally count one or more rectangles twice. This will result in an incorrect answer. To avoid this, make sure to check that you are only counting each rectangle once.

**3. Undefined behavior**

If you divide by zero, the program will enter an undefined state. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. To avoid this, make sure that you check for division by zero before performing the division.

**4. Memory leak**

If you allocate memory and do not free it, the program will eventually run out of memory and crash. To avoid this, make sure to free any memory that you allocate.

**5. Race condition**

When multiple threads access the same data at the same time, it is possible for the data to become corrupted. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. To avoid this, make sure to use locks to protect shared data.

CODEFORCES 1211_B. Traveling Around the Golden Ring of Berland

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is "n a_1 a_2 ... a_n", where n is the number of cities and a_i is the number of selfies in the i-th city. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will output incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer, which is the minimum number of city visits Polycarp will have to complete to fulfill his plan for the number of selfies for each city. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly output the results and will receive a compilation error.

**3. Undefined behavior**

The program may exhibit undefined behavior if it is not written correctly. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as using uninitialized variables, dereferencing null pointers, or dividing by zero. If the program exhibits undefined behavior, it may crash or produce incorrect results.

**4. Memory leaks**

The program may leak memory if it does not properly free memory that it has allocated. This can happen if the program uses a function that allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed, or if the program creates a new object on the heap but does not delete it when it is no longer needed. Memory leaks can eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash.

**5. Race conditions**

The program may experience race conditions if it is not thread-safe. This can happen if two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time and the results are not properly synchronized. Race conditions can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.

**6. Deadlocks**

The program may deadlock if it is not designed correctly. This can happen if two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, and neither thread can ever release the lock. Deadlocks can eventually cause the program to run out of resources and crash.

**7. Security vulnerabilities**

The program may be vulnerable to security attacks if it is not written securely. This can happen if the program allows users to input data that is not properly sanitized, or if the program uses insecure cryptographic algorithms. Security vulnerabilities can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or to its data.

**8. Performance bottlenecks**

The program may have performance bottlenecks if it is not written efficiently. This can happen if the program uses inefficient algorithms or data structures, or if the program does not use caching or other performance optimizations. Performance bottlenecks can cause the program to run slowly or to crash.

CODEFORCES 1252_K. Addition Robot

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the f(L, R, A, B) function.** The most common mistake is to forget to update the values of A and B after each iteration of the loop. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. Incorrect handling of the modulo operator. The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. This means that if the result of a calculation is greater than or equal to 1000000007, the modulo operator will return a number less than 1000000007. This can lead to incorrect results if the values of A and B are large.
3. Incorrect handling of the input data. The input data may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers that are too large. This can lead to errors in the program.
4. Incorrect handling of the output data. The output data must be formatted correctly and must be within the specified range. This can lead to errors if the output data is not formatted correctly or if it is outside of the specified range.
5. Incorrect use of the bitwise operators. The bitwise operators (|, &, ^, <<, >>) can be used to perform operations on bits. This can be useful for optimizing the performance of your program, but it can also be a source of errors if they are not used correctly.
6. Incorrect use of the conditional operators. The conditional operators (?, :, &&, ||) can be used to make decisions in your program. This can be useful for improving the readability of your code, but it can also be a source of errors if they are not used correctly.
7. Incorrect use of the looping constructs. The looping constructs (for, while, do-while) can be used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times. This can be useful for iterating over a collection of data or for performing a task multiple times. However, it is important to use the looping constructs correctly to avoid errors.
8. Incorrect use of the functions. The functions in a programming language can be used to group together related code. This can be useful for improving the readability and maintainability of your code. However, it is important to use the functions correctly to avoid errors.
9. Incorrect use of the variables. The variables in a programming language can be used to store data. This can be useful for keeping track of state or for passing data between functions. However, it is important to use the variables correctly to avoid errors.
10. Incorrect use of the comments. The comments in a programming language can be used to provide information about the code. This can be useful for other developers who are reading your code or for yourself when you come back to your code later. However, it is important to use the comments correctly to avoid errors.

CODEFORCES 1276_D. Tree Elimination

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not correctly specified. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or it may contain a newline character in the middle of a number. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The data type of a variable may be incorrect. For example, a variable that is supposed to store an integer may be declared as a string. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect output.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors occur when a programmer accidentally writes a code that is one unit off from the correct code. For example, a programmer may accidentally write a loop that iterates one time too many or one time too few. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect output.

**4. Logical errors**

Logical errors occur when a programmer makes a mistake in the logic of the program. For example, a programmer may accidentally write a code that does not do what it is supposed to do. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect output.

**5. Memory errors**

Memory errors occur when a programmer accidentally allocates too much or too little memory for a variable. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect output.

**6. Race conditions**

Race conditions occur when two or more threads of execution try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect output.

**7. Deadlocks**

Deadlocks occur when two or more threads of execution are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect output.

**8. Stack overflows**

Stack overflows occur when a program uses up all of the available stack space. This can cause the program to crash.

**9. Buffer overflows**

Buffer overflows occur when a program writes data to a buffer that is not large enough to hold the data. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect output.

**10. Format string vulnerabilities**

Format string vulnerabilities occur when a program uses a format string that is not properly escaped. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1296_E1. String Coloring (easy version)

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input consists of an integer n and a string s. The integer n is the length of the string s. If you use the wrong data type to store n, you may get a runtime error. For example, if you use a short integer to store n, you may get a runtime error when n is larger than the maximum value of a short integer.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks us to color the characters of the string s so that the string can be sorted by some sequence of swaps. A naive algorithm is to try all possible colorings and check if any of them can make the string sorted. However, this algorithm has a time complexity of O(n!), which is too slow for large values of n.

A better algorithm is to use a greedy algorithm. The greedy algorithm works as follows:

1. Sort the characters of the string s in alphabetical order.
2. Color the first half of the characters with color 0 and the second half of the characters with color 1.

If the string s is already sorted, then the greedy algorithm will return a correct coloring. If the string s is not sorted, then the greedy algorithm may not return a correct coloring. However, the greedy algorithm will always return a coloring that is as close to being correct as possible.

**3. Not handling special cases**

The problem statement does not mention any special cases. However, there are two special cases that you should be aware of:

1. The string s may be empty.
2. The string s may contain only one character.

If the string s is empty, then the answer is always "YES". If the string s contains only one character, then the answer is always "YES" and the coloring is always "0".

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output should be a string of n characters, where the i-th character is '0' if the i-th character is colored the first color and '1' otherwise. If you do not follow this format, your solution will be incorrect.
Test inputs:
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 131_E. Yet Another Task with Queens

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly specified, so it is possible to make a mistake when reading the input data. For example, if the input contains a line with more than two integers, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not strictly specified, so it is possible to make a mistake when writing the output data. For example, if the output contains a line with more than nine integers, the program will crash.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the number of queens that threaten other queens**

The most common mistake is to incorrectly calculate the number of queens that threaten other queens. For example, if a queen is located in the center of the board, it threatens all eight other queens. However, if a queen is located on the edge of the board, it threatens only four other queens.

**4. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

The problem statement does not specify how to handle edge cases. For example, if the number of queens is zero, the program should print an empty line. However, if the number of queens is one, the program should print a line with one zero.

**5. Incorrect use of data structures**

The problem can be solved using a variety of data structures. However, it is important to choose the right data structure for the problem. For example, if the problem requires to store the positions of all queens, it is better to use a two-dimensional array.

**6. Incorrect use of algorithms**

The problem can be solved using a variety of algorithms. However, it is important to choose the right algorithm for the problem. For example, if the problem requires to find all queens that threaten other queens, it is better to use a breadth-first search algorithm.

CODEFORCES 1360_F. Spy-string

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very strict. It is possible to enter a string with a different number of characters than the specified length, or to enter a string with non-alphabetic characters. This can lead to errors in the program's output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also not very strict. It is possible to output a string with a different number of characters than the specified length, or to output a string with non-alphabetic characters. This can lead to errors in the program's output.

**3. Incorrect use of data structures**

The problem requires the use of a data structure to store the strings. If the data structure is not used correctly, it can lead to errors in the program's output.

**4. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve this problem is not very complex, but it is still possible to make mistakes. For example, the algorithm may not take into account all possible cases, or it may not be efficient enough. This can lead to errors in the program's output.

**5. Incorrect error handling**

The program should be able to handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input format is incorrect, the program should print an error message and exit. If the program encounters a runtime error, it should also print an error message and exit. This will help the user to identify and fix the problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1380_G. Circular Dungeon

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is an integer array. If you mistakenly use a float array to store the input data, you will get wrong results.

**2. Using the wrong formula**

The expected value of players earnings is the sum of the expected values of each room. The expected value of a room with a mimic chest is 0, and the expected value of a room with a regular chest is the treasure value of the chest. So the expected value of players earnings is the sum of the treasure values of all regular chests.

**3. Not handling the edge cases**

The input data may contain 0 or 1 room. In this case, the expected value of players earnings is 0.

**4. Using a wrong modulo**

The expected value of players earnings is a fraction. When you print the output, you need to multiply it by the modulo inverse of the denominator and then take the modulo of the product.

**5. Not using the right data structure**

The input data is an integer array. You can use a heap to store the treasure values of the chests. This will help you find the minimum treasure value quickly.

```

1. **Incorrect use of global variables.** The variable `res` is declared as a global variable, but it is not used in the function `dfs`. This can lead to unexpected results.
2. **Incorrect use of the `%` operator.** The `%` operator returns the remainder of a division operation. In the code, the `%` operator is used to calculate the modulus of the result of the `dfs` function. This is incorrect, as the modulus should be calculated before the `%` operator is applied.
3. **Incorrect use of the `range` function.** The `range` function returns a sequence of numbers from a starting value to an ending value. In the code, the `range` function is used to iterate over the indices of the array `l`. This is incorrect, as the `range` function should be used to iterate over the elements of the array.
4. **Incorrect use of the `zip` function.** The `zip` function takes two or more iterables as arguments and returns an iterator that produces tuples of corresponding elements from the iterables. In the code, the `zip` function is used to iterate over the elements of the arrays `l` and `v`. This is incorrect, as the `zip` function should be used to iterate over the tuples produced by the `zip` function.
5. **Incorrect use of the `if` statement.** The `if` statement is used to check a condition and execute a block of code if the condition is true. In the code, the `if` statement is used to check if the value of the variable `cnt` is greater than or equal to 1. This is incorrect, as the `if` statement should be used to check if the value of the variable `cnt` is less than or equal to 1.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1445_C. Division

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input constraints for this problem are `1 <= p_i <= 10^18; 2 <= q_i <= 10^9`. This means that we need to use a data type that can store integers up to 10^18. The most common data type for integers in C++ is `int`, but `int` can only store integers up to 2^31-1, which is much smaller than 10^18. We can use the `long long` data type to store integers up to 10^18.

**2. Not handling negative integers correctly**

The input does not specify whether the integers `p_i` and `q_i` can be negative. We need to make sure to handle negative integers correctly. If either `p_i` or `q_i` is negative, then the greatest integer `x_i` such that `p_i` is divisible by `x_i` but `x_i` is not divisible by `q_i` is `-p_i`.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The naive algorithm for solving this problem is to iterate over all integers from `1` to `p_i` and check if each integer is divisible by `p_i` but not divisible by `q_i`. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(p_i), which is not efficient for large values of `p_i`.

A more efficient algorithm is to use the following fact: if `p_i` is divisible by `q_i` and `q_i` is not prime, then the greatest integer `x_i` such that `p_i` is divisible by `x_i` but `x_i` is not divisible by `q_i` is `p_i / q_i`. We can use this fact to reduce the time complexity of the algorithm to O(log q_i).

**4. Not handling overflow correctly**

When we are computing `p_i / q_i`, we need to be careful to handle overflow. We can use the following algorithm to compute `p_i / q_i` without overflow:

```
while (q_i <= p_i) {
  p_i -= q_i;
}
return p_i;
```

**5. Not using the right data structures**

We can use a hash table to store the values of `p_i / q_i` for each value of `q_i`. This will allow us to quickly check if a given integer is divisible by `q_i`.

**6. Not using the right libraries**

There are a number of libraries that can be used to solve this problem. For example, the `<math.h>` library contains the `fmod()` function, which can be used to compute the remainder of a division.

**7. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it to the judge. This will help you to catch any errors in your code and make sure that it is correct.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type.** The input data is a list of integers, but the code is expecting a list of strings. This will cause a ValueError.
2. **Incorrect index.** The code is trying to access the element at index `n` of the list, but the list only has `n - 1` elements. This will cause a IndexError.
3. **Off-by-one error.** The code is calculating the distance between two robots by subtracting their indices, but this will not work correctly if the robots are at opposite ends of the circle.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The code is not correctly tracking the robots that have already discarded cards. This will cause the program to output an incorrect answer.
5. **Infinite loop.** The code is using a while loop to iterate over the robots, but the loop condition is never met. This will cause the program to run forever.
6. **Memory leak.** The code is not freeing up the memory that it is using for the robots. This will eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully check your code for any errors. Make sure that you are using the correct data types, that you are indexing the lists correctly, and that you are using the correct logic. You should also test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is working correctly.

CODEFORCES 1519_B. The Cake Is a Lie

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of variables.** In the following code, `i` and `j` are used to iterate over the grid, but `i` is also used to track the number of moves. This will cause an infinite loop if `k` is greater than `n * m`.

```

2. **Off-by-one errors.** In the following code, the condition `i < n - 1 and k >= n` will always be true, because `i` is initialized to 0 and `n` is greater than 0. This will cause the code to incorrectly return `True` for any value of `k`.

    else:
      return False
  return False
```

3. **Incorrect use of mathematical operators.** In the following code, the expression `k / n + k / m` will always be greater than or equal to 1, because `k` is always greater than 0. This will cause the code to incorrectly return `True` for any value of `k`.

```
def solve(n, m, k):
  if k / n + k / m >= 1:
    return True
  return False
```

4. **Incorrect use of conditional statements.** In the following code, the condition `k == 0` will always be true, because `k` is initialized to 0. This will cause the code to incorrectly return `True` for any value of `k`.

```
def solve(n, m, k):
  if k == 0:
    return True
  return False
```

5. **Incorrect use of loops.** In the following code, the loop `while i < n and j < m` will never terminate, because `i` and `j` are both initialized to 0. This will cause the code to run indefinitely.

```
def solve(n, m, k):
  i, j = 0, 0
  while i < n and j < m:
    # Do something
  ```

6. **Incorrect use of functions.** In the following code, the function `solve` is not defined. This will cause the code to throw an error.

```
def main():
  # Get input
  n, m, k = map(int, input().split())

  # Solve the problem
  if solve(n, m, k):
    print('YES')
  else:
    print('NO')

CODEFORCES 524_E. Rooks and Rectangles

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of rows or columns is not specified correctly, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values may not be correctly specified, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of rooks is specified as a string, the program may not be able to correctly parse it.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the programmer forgets to add or subtract one from a calculation. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a rook being placed in the wrong square.
4. **Logic errors**. Logic errors occur when the programmer makes a mistake in the logic of the program. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a rook being able to attack a square that it should not be able to.
5. **Memory errors**. Memory errors occur when the program allocates more memory than it needs. This can lead to the program crashing or running slowly.
6. **Synchronization errors**. Synchronization errors occur when multiple parts of the program try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
7. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more parts of the program try to access the same data at the same time and the outcome depends on the order in which the accesses are made. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
8. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more parts of the program are waiting for each other to release a resource, and neither one can do so. This can lead to the program crashing or running indefinitely.
9. **Unhandled exceptions**. Unhandled exceptions occur when the program encounters an error that it cannot handle. This can lead to the program crashing or running indefinitely.
10. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities occur when the program allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system. This can lead to the attacker stealing data, modifying data, or taking control of the system.

Title:
CODEFORCES 599_D. Spongebob and Squares

Pain points:
### 1. **Incorrect input format**.

The input format for this problem is a single integer `x`. If the input is not in the correct format, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

### 2. **Incorrect output format**.

The output for this problem should be a single integer `k` followed by `k` pairs of integers. If the output is not in the correct format, the program will not be accepted by the judge.

### 3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of squares**.

The number of squares in a table with `n` rows and `m` columns is given by the formula `n * m + (n - 1) * (m - 1)`. If the program incorrectly calculates the number of squares, the output will be incorrect.

### 4. **Incorrect sorting of the output**.

The output should be sorted in the order of increasing `n`, and in case of equality, in the order of increasing `m`. If the output is not sorted correctly, the program will not be accepted by the judge.

### 5. **Other bugs**.

There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:

* Using the wrong data type for `x` or the `n` and `m` values.
* Using an incorrect algorithm to calculate the number of squares.
* Sorting the output incorrectly.
* Using incorrect variable names or indentation.
* Making a logic error in the code.

By carefully avoiding these potential problems, you can increase the chances of your program correctly solving the problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 669_E. Little Artem and Time Machine

Pain points:
1
 0
1. **Incorrect implementation of the data structure.** The data structure used to store the multiset must be able to handle multiple instances of the same element, and it must be able to efficiently insert, remove, and count elements. A naive implementation using a hash table or a linked list would not be able to handle this efficiently, as it would require O(n) time to insert or remove an element, and O(1) time to count the number of instances of an element. A more efficient implementation would use a binary search tree or a red-black tree, as these data structures allow for O(log n) time insertion, removal, and counting.
2. **Incorrect handling of queries.** The queries must be processed in the correct order, and the results of each query must be computed correctly. A common mistake is to process the queries in the order in which they are received, rather than in the order in which they were made. This can lead to incorrect results, as the multiset may change between the time a query is received and the time it is processed. Another common mistake is to incorrectly compute the results of a query. For example, if a query asks for the number of instances of an element that were in the multiset at a certain time, the answer must be computed based on the state of the multiset at that time, not the current state of the multiset.
3. **Incorrect handling of exceptions.** The multiset must be able to handle exceptions gracefully. For example, if a user attempts to add an element that is already in the multiset, the multiset must not throw an exception. Instead, it should simply ignore the add operation. Similarly, if a user attempts to remove an element that is not in the multiset, the multiset must not throw an exception. Instead, it should simply ignore the remove operation.
4. **Incorrect use of pointers.** Pointers are a powerful tool, but they can also be a source of bugs. One common mistake is to dereference a pointer that is not initialized. This can lead to a segmentation fault, which is a fatal error that causes the program to crash. Another common mistake is to pass a pointer to a function that does not expect a pointer. This can lead to undefined behavior, which is a condition that is not specified by the language standard and can lead to unexpected results.
5. **Incorrect use of memory.** Memory is a finite resource, and it is important to use it efficiently. One common mistake is to allocate too much memory. This can lead to a memory leak, which is a condition where memory is allocated but never freed. Another common mistake is to free memory that is still in use. This can lead to a dangling pointer, which is a pointer that points to memory that has been freed. Dangling pointers can be a source of security vulnerabilities.
6. **Incorrect error handling.** It is important to handle errors gracefully. For example, if a function fails, it should return an error code rather than crashing. This allows the caller of the function to take appropriate action, such as retrying the operation or logging the error.
7. **Incorrect documentation.** The documentation for a multiset should be clear and concise. It should provide a detailed description of the data structure, its operations, and its limitations. The documentation should also provide examples of how to use the data structure.
8. **Incorrect testing.** It is important to test a multiset thoroughly before releasing it to production. The tests should cover all possible scenarios, including valid and invalid inputs, expected and unexpected behavior, and corner cases. The tests should also be automated, so that they can be run regularly to ensure that the multiset is still working correctly.

CODEFORCES 690_E2. Photographs (II)

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect image loading**

When loading the image, it is important to make sure that the image is loaded correctly. This can be done by checking the image dimensions and the image data. If the image dimensions are not correct, or if the image data is corrupted, then the image will not be loaded correctly and the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect image processing**

Once the image is loaded, it is important to process the image correctly. This includes resizing the image, converting the image to grayscale, and blurring the image. If the image is not processed correctly, then the program will not be able to identify the pieces of the image correctly.

**3. Incorrect piece identification**

Once the image is processed, it is important to identify the pieces of the image correctly. This can be done by finding the edges of the pieces and by identifying the unique features of each piece. If the pieces are not identified correctly, then the program will not be able to assemble the image correctly.

**4. Incorrect image assembly**

Once the pieces of the image are identified, it is important to assemble the image correctly. This can be done by finding the overlaps between the pieces and by aligning the pieces together. If the image is not assembled correctly, then the program will not be able to solve the problem.

**5. Incorrect output formatting**

The output of the program must be formatted correctly. This means that the output must be a list of numbers, and each number must be separated by a space. If the output is not formatted correctly, then the program will not be accepted.

**6. Incorrect solution**

The solution to the problem must be correct. This means that the program must be able to assemble the image correctly for at least 75% of the test cases. If the solution is not correct, then the program will not be accepted.

CODEFORCES 715_B. Complete The Graph

Pain points:
### Possible Problems

* **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of vertices is not a positive integer, the program may crash.
* **Incorrect edge weights**. The edge weights must be positive integers. If an edge weight is negative or non-integer, the program may crash.
* **Incorrect shortest path length**. The shortest path length must be a positive integer. If the shortest path length is negative or non-integer, the program may crash.
* **Incorrect graph structure**. The graph must be a connected graph. If the graph is not connected, the program may not be able to find a shortest path between the two given vertices.
* **Incorrect solution**. The solution must assign positive integer weights to all of the erased edge weights. If the solution does not satisfy this condition, the program may not be able to find a shortest path between the two given vertices.

### Possible Bugs

* **Off-by-one errors**. The program may accidentally skip or repeat an edge when finding the shortest path. This can lead to incorrect results.
* **Incorrect use of pointers**. The program may accidentally overwrite or lose data when using pointers. This can lead to incorrect results or program crashes.
* **Incorrect use of dynamic memory**. The program may accidentally allocate too much or too little memory. This can lead to program crashes or incorrect results.
* **Incorrect use of functions**. The program may accidentally call a function with the wrong arguments or in the wrong order. This can lead to incorrect results or program crashes.

### How to Avoid These Problems

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement and input format. It is also important to test the program thoroughly with a variety of inputs. Here are some specific tips for avoiding each of the problems listed above:

* To avoid incorrect input format errors, make sure to strictly follow the input format specified in the problem statement. Use a tool like [fscanf](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fscanf/) to read the input into variables.
* To avoid incorrect edge weights, make sure to check that all of the edge weights are positive integers. Use a tool like [atoi](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/atoi/) to convert the edge weights from strings to integers.
* To avoid incorrect shortest path length, make sure to check that the shortest path length is a positive integer. Use a tool like [abs](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/abs/) to calculate the absolute value of the shortest path length.
* To avoid incorrect graph structure, make sure that the graph is a connected graph. Use a tool like [connected_components](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/book/connectivity/connectivity.html) to check if the graph is connected.
* To avoid incorrect solutions, make sure that all of the erased edge weights are assigned positive integer weights. Use a tool like [map](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/) to keep track of the erased edge weights and their assigned weights.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

CODEFORCES 75_D. Big Maximum Sum

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Time and memory limit exceeded**. The input arrays can be very large, so it is important to be careful about the time and memory complexity of your solution.
2. **Incorrect concatenation of the small arrays**. The small arrays must be concatenated in the same order as they appear in the input.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum sum**. The maximum sum must be calculated over all possible subarrays of the big array.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The indexes in the big array are 1-based, so it is important to be careful about off-by-one errors when concatenating the small arrays.
5. **Incorrect output format**. The output must be a single line containing the maximum sum in the big array.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect concatenation of the small arrays:** A developer might accidentally concatenate the small arrays in the wrong order, or they might forget to include some of the small arrays in the concatenation. This would result in an incorrect answer.
* **Incorrect calculation of the maximum sum:** A developer might accidentally calculate the maximum sum over a subarray that does not exist in the big array. This would also result in an incorrect answer.
* **Off-by-one errors:** A developer might accidentally use the wrong index when concatenating the small arrays, or they might forget to subtract 1 from the indexes when calculating the maximum sum. This would also result in an incorrect answer.
* **Incorrect output format:** A developer might accidentally output the maximum sum in the wrong format, or they might forget to include the newline character at the end of the output. This would result in an incorrect answer.

By carefully avoiding these potential problems, you can write a correct and efficient solution to this problem.

5. **Indexing errors.** Indexing errors occur when the programmer accesses an element of an array or list using an incorrect index. This can lead to incorrect results or even a crash.
6. **Memory leaks.** Memory leaks occur when the programmer forgets to free up memory that has been allocated. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
7. **Race conditions.** Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even a crash.
8. **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can lead to the program being stuck in an infinite loop.
9. **Uncaught exceptions.** Uncaught exceptions occur when the program encounters an error that it cannot handle. This can lead to the program crashing.
10. **Security vulnerabilities.** Security vulnerabilities can occur when the programmer does not properly secure the program. This can lead to attackers being able to access sensitive data or even take control of the program.

CODEFORCES 803_G. Periodic RMQ Problem

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the RMQ data structure.** This is the most common mistake that programmers make when solving this problem. The RMQ data structure is a crucial part of the solution, so it's important to get it right.
2. **Incorrect handling of queries.** The queries in this problem are a bit tricky, so it's important to make sure that you're handling them correctly.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum value.** The minimum value in a segment can be calculated in a variety of ways. It's important to choose the most efficient method for your particular implementation.
4. **Incorrect error handling.** It's important to handle errors gracefully in your code. This includes checking for invalid input, out-of-bounds errors, and other potential problems.
5. **Incorrect debugging.** If your code is not working correctly, it's important to be able to debug it effectively. This includes using tools like a debugger, print statements, and unit tests.

Title:
CODEFORCES 828_E. DNA Evolution

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of `cin` and `cout`.**

The `cin` and `cout` functions are used to read and write data from and to the standard input and output streams, respectively. However, they are not thread-safe, which means that if multiple threads try to use them at the same time, it can lead to data corruption. To avoid this, you should use the `std::cin` and `std::cout` objects instead.

**2. Using uninitialized variables.**

A variable is uninitialized when it is declared but not assigned a value. Using an uninitialized variable can lead to undefined behavior, which means that the program may behave in an unpredictable way. To avoid this, you should always initialize your variables before using them.

**3. Off-by-one errors.**

Off-by-one errors occur when you accidentally miscalculate the index of an array or other data structure. This can lead to the program accessing invalid data, which can cause errors or crashes. To avoid this, you should always be careful when calculating indices.

**4. Using the wrong data type.**

Using the wrong data type can lead to errors in your program. For example, if you try to store a number that is too large in a variable that is too small, the program will overflow and produce incorrect results. To avoid this, you should always use the correct data type for the data you are storing.

**5. Not handling errors correctly.**

Your program should always handle errors correctly. This means that you should check for errors and take appropriate action if they occur. For example, if your program tries to open a file that does not exist, it should report an error and exit gracefully.

**6. Not using defensive programming techniques.**

Defensive programming techniques are used to protect your program from errors that can occur during runtime. For example, you can use assert statements to check for invalid inputs and ensure that your program is behaving correctly. Defensive programming techniques can help to catch errors early and prevent them from causing problems.

**7. Not testing your code.**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before you deploy it to production. This will help to catch bugs and ensure that your program is working as expected. There are many different ways to test your code, such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.

CODEFORCES 948_A. Protect Sheep

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrectly identifying the starting position of the sheep and wolves.** This is a common mistake that can lead to the developer placing the dogs in the wrong locations. To avoid this, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and identify the starting positions of the sheep and wolves.
* **Not considering all possible movements of the wolves.** Wolves can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. It is important to consider all of these possible movements when placing the dogs, as a wolf that is not blocked by a dog can reach a sheep and consume it.
* **Not placing enough dogs to protect all of the sheep.** The number of dogs required to protect all of the sheep depends on the layout of the pasture and the starting positions of the sheep and wolves. It is important to place enough dogs to ensure that all of the sheep are safe.
* **Using a brute force approach to solve the problem.** A brute force approach to solving this problem would involve checking every possible combination of dog placements. This can be very time-consuming, especially for large pastures. A more efficient approach would be to use a heuristic to find a good solution quickly.

Here are some additional tips that may help you avoid these problems:

* Use a diagram to visualize the problem. This can help you to identify the starting positions of the sheep and wolves and to consider all of the possible movements of the wolves.
* Use a backtracking algorithm to find a solution. A backtracking algorithm starts with an initial solution and then makes a series of changes to the solution until it finds a solution that satisfies the constraints of the problem.
* Use a heuristic to guide the search for a solution. A heuristic is a rule of thumb that can be used to improve the efficiency of the search.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs that developers encounter when solving this problem.

CODEFORCES 976_A. Minimum Binary Number

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain an integer `n` and the second line should contain a string `s`. However, if the input format is not followed, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the output should be a string. However, if the output is not a string, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect use of the `swap` and `replace` functions.** The `swap` function swaps the values of two variables, while the `replace` function replaces the value of a variable with another value. If these functions are used incorrectly, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect use of the `val` function.** The `val` function returns the value of a string as a number. If this function is used incorrectly, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
5. **Incorrect use of the `<` operator.** The `<` operator compares two values and returns a boolean value indicating whether the first value is less than the second value. If this operator is used incorrectly, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
6. **Incorrect use of the `for` loop.** The `for` loop iterates over a sequence of values. If this loop is used incorrectly, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
7. **Incorrect use of the `if` statement.** The `if` statement executes a block of code if a certain condition is met. If this statement is used incorrectly, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
8. **Incorrect use of the `else` statement.** The `else` statement executes a block of code if the condition in the `if` statement is not met. If this statement is used incorrectly, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
9. **Incorrect use of the `return` statement.** The `return` statement terminates the function and returns a value. If this statement is used incorrectly, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
10. **Incorrect use of the `break` statement.** The `break` statement terminates the loop immediately. If this statement is used incorrectly, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 995_E. Number Clicker

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not strictly followed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is `1 3 5`, the program may expect the input to be `u, v, p`, where `u`, `v`, and `p` are integers. However, if the input is `1, 3, 5`, the program may interpret the input as `u`, `v`, and `p` being strings, which will lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect use of modulo operator**. The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder of a division. For example, `10 % 3` returns `1`. However, if the dividend is greater than the divisor, the modulo operator will return a negative number. For example, `11 % 3` returns `-2`. This can lead to incorrect results if the program is not careful about the sign of the modulo operator.
3. **Incorrect use of exponentiation operator**. The exponentiation operator `^` raises a number to a power. For example, `2 ^ 3` returns `8`. However, if the exponent is negative, the exponentiation operator will return a complex number. For example, `2 ^ -1` returns `1 / 2`. This can lead to incorrect results if the program is not careful about the type of the exponent.
4. **Incorrect use of the bitwise operators**. The bitwise operators `&`, `|`, and `^` perform bitwise operations on two integers. For example, `1 & 2` returns `0`. However, if the two integers are not the same size, the bitwise operators will perform bitwise operations on the least significant bits of the two integers. For example, `1 & 3` returns `1`. This can lead to incorrect results if the program is not careful about the size of the integers.
5. **Incorrect use of the logical operators**. The logical operators `&&`, `||`, and `!` perform logical operations on two boolean values. For example, `true && false` returns `false`. However, if the two boolean values are not the same type, the logical operators will perform logical operations on the boolean values as if they were both integers. For example, `true && 'a'` returns `1`. This can lead to incorrect results if the program is not careful about the type of the boolean values.
6. **Incorrect use of the assignment operator**. The assignment operator `=` assigns a value to a variable. For example, `x = 5` assigns the value `5` to the variable `x`. However, if the variable is not declared, the assignment operator will create a new variable with the given value. For example, `x = 5` will create a new variable called `x` and assign the value `5` to it. This can lead to incorrect results if the program is not careful about the declaration of variables.
7. **Incorrect use of the increment and decrement operators**. The increment operator `++` and the decrement operator `--` increase and decrease the value of a variable by one, respectively. For example, `x++` increases the value of the variable `x` by one. However, if the variable is not declared, the increment and decrement operators will create a new variable with the value `0` and then increment or decrement the value of the new variable. For example, `x++` will create a new variable called `x` and assign the value `0` to it. This can lead to incorrect results if the program is not careful about the declaration of variables.
8. **Incorrect use of the break and continue statements**. The break statement terminates the current loop, and the continue statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop. For example, the following code will print the numbers from 1 to 10:

```
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  if (i == 5) {
    break;
  }
  System.out.println(i);
}
```

However, if the break statement is placed after the `System.out.println()` statement, the code will print the numbers from 1 to 4 and then terminate the loop. This can lead to incorrect results if the program is not careful about the placement of the break statement.
9. **Incorrect use of the goto statement**. The goto statement transfers the execution of the program to a specified label. For example, the following code will print the numbers from 1 to 10:

```
int i = 1;
label1:
  System.out.println(i);
  i++;

2. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may forget to add 1 to the index when iterating over the array. This will cause the program to miss some elements of the array.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program. This could lead to the program giving an incorrect answer.
4. **Memory leak**. The developer may not release memory that is no longer needed. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
5. **Race condition**. The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data. This can lead to the program giving incorrect results or crashing.
6. **Deadlock**. The developer may create a situation where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely.
7. **Security vulnerability**. The developer may make a mistake that allows a malicious user to gain access to sensitive data or take control of the program.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully review their code and test it thoroughly before deploying it to production.

HACKEREARTH email-validator

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not specified.** The problem statement does not specify the input format. It is possible that the input is a list of strings, a list of lists of strings, or something else entirely. This could lead to errors if the developer does not correctly parse the input.
2. **The email address validation logic is not correct.** The problem statement specifies a number of criteria that an email address must meet in order to be valid. The developer must ensure that their validation logic correctly checks for all of these criteria.
3. **The output format is not specified.** The problem statement does not specify the output format. It is possible that the developer is expected to print a message for each email address, or to return a list of boolean values, or something else entirely. This could lead to errors if the developer does not correctly format the output.
4. **The code is not robust.** The developer must ensure that their code is robust and handles all possible errors. For example, the code should handle invalid input, such as an empty string or a string that does not contain an email address. The code should also handle errors that occur during validation, such as a network connection failure.
5. **The code is not efficient.** The developer must ensure that their code is efficient. This means that the code should run quickly and should not use excessive amounts of memory. The developer may need to use a variety of techniques to optimize their code, such as using a cache or using a more efficient algorithm.

Title:
HACKEREARTH heartbroken-lala

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the `switch` and `reverse` functions**

The `switch` function should interchange the digits 0 and 1, while the `reverse` function should reverse the order of the digits in a string. If these functions are implemented incorrectly, the output of the program will be incorrect.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the kth digit of the string**

The kth digit of the string is calculated by starting with the first digit of the string and iterating through the string, one digit at a time, until the kth digit is reached. If the kth digit is not found in the string, the program should output `-1`.

**3. Overflow errors**

The program may encounter overflow errors if the value of `k` is too large. To avoid this, the program should check if the value of `k` is within the range of the string. If the value of `k` is not within the range of the string, the program should output `-1`.

**4. Other bugs**

There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:

* Incorrect handling of edge cases
* Incorrect use of pointers
* Incorrect use of memory
* Incorrect use of variables
* Incorrect logic

By carefully following the instructions in the problem statement and avoiding these common pitfalls, developers can write a correct and efficient solution to this problem.

1. **Incorrectly checking if a number is greater than all numbers to its right.** A common mistake is to check if a number is greater than all numbers to its right by simply iterating through the array from that number onwards. However, this is incorrect because it is possible that a number is greater than all numbers to its right but not greater than all numbers in the entire array. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the number `5` is greater than all numbers to its right but not greater than the number `1`.
2. **Using an incorrect data structure to store the numbers in the array.** Another common mistake is to use an incorrect data structure to store the numbers in the array. For example, using a list to store the numbers is incorrect because it is possible for the list to become unordered, which would make it difficult to check if a number is greater than all numbers to its right.
3. **Not handling the edge cases correctly.** There are a few edge cases that need to be handled correctly when solving this problem. For example, the array may be empty, or it may contain only one element. In these cases, the correct answer is `0`.
4. **Using an inefficient algorithm.** The most efficient way to solve this problem is to use a binary search. However, a naive algorithm that iterates through the entire array would be much slower.

HACKEREARTH problem-9-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly initializing the array of coins.** The array of coins should be initialized to all 0s, representing tails. If it is initialized to all 1s, representing heads, then the answers to the queries will be incorrect.
2. **Using the wrong index when flipping coins.** When flipping coins, you need to use the correct index in the array. For example, if you want to flip the coin at index 3, you need to use the expression `coins[3]`. If you use the wrong index, the coins will not be flipped correctly.
3. **Using the wrong index when counting the number of heads.** When counting the number of heads, you need to use the correct index in the array. For example, if you want to count the number of heads between indices 3 and 5, you need to use the expression `count(coins[3], coins[5])`. If you use the wrong index, the number of heads will be incorrect.
4. **Not handling the case where the query range is out of bounds.** The query range should always be between 0 and `n - 1`, inclusive. If the query range is out of bounds, you need to handle this case gracefully. For example, you could print an error message or return `-1`.
5. **Not handling the case where there are no coins.** If `n == 0`, then there are no coins to flip. In this case, you need to handle this case gracefully. For example, you could print an empty list or return `0`.

Title:
HACKEREARTH the-battle-of-panipat-4

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm.** The tree traversal algorithm is a recursive algorithm that visits each node in a tree exactly once. If the implementation is incorrect, it may miss some nodes or visit some nodes more than once. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of ways to protect the cities.** The number of ways to protect the cities is the number of subsets of the cities that form a tree. This can be calculated using the inclusion-exclusion principle. However, if the implementation of the inclusion-exclusion principle is incorrect, it may give incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect modulo operation.** The final answer must be modulo 10^9 + 7. If the modulo operation is incorrect, it may give incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect input handling.** The input must be a tree. If the input is not a tree, the algorithm may not work correctly.
5. **Incorrect output handling.** The output must be a number modulo 10^9 + 7. If the output is not a number modulo 10^9 + 7, it may be rejected by the judge.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully implement the tree traversal algorithm, the calculation of the number of ways to protect the cities, the modulo operation, and the input and output handling.

Title:
HACKEREARTH xenny-and-composite-number

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be a single integer `t` followed by `t` lines, each containing a single integer `n`. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not work correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer `n` for each test case, where `n` is the smallest composite number greater than `n`. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be accepted by the judge.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program should find the smallest composite number greater than `n` for each test case. A common mistake is to find the smallest prime number greater than `n`. Another common mistake is to find the smallest composite number less than `n`.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. When finding the smallest composite number greater than `n`, it is important to make sure that the number you find is actually greater than `n`. A common mistake is to find the smallest composite number that is equal to `n`.
5. **Infinite loops**. The program should terminate after finding the smallest composite number greater than `n` for each test case. A common mistake is to write a loop that never terminates.
6. **Memory leaks**. The program should not allocate any memory that it does not need. A common mistake is to allocate memory for a data structure that is larger than necessary.
7. **Incorrect data types**. The program should use the correct data types for all of its variables. A common mistake is to use an integer variable to store a floating-point number.
8. **Incorrect variable names**. The program should use clear and descriptive variable names. A common mistake is to use cryptic or meaningless variable names.
9. **Unnecessary code**. The program should only include the code that is necessary to solve the problem. A common mistake is to include code that is not needed for the problem.
10. **Unclear comments**. The program should include clear and concise comments that explain the purpose of the code. A common mistake is to include comments that are unclear or misleading.

Title:
ATCODER p02774 AtCoder Beginner Contest 155 - Pairs

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data includes a lot of integers with large absolute values. If we use an integer data type with a small range, such as `int`, we may get an overflow error. To avoid this, we should use a data type with a large range, such as `long long`.

**2. Not considering the case where `K` is larger than the number of pairs**

The input data includes a parameter `K`. If `K` is larger than the number of pairs, the answer is undefined. We should check the value of `K` and output `-1` if it is larger than the number of pairs.

**3. Not sorting the products of the pairs in ascending order**

The output should be the `K`-th smallest product of the pairs. We should sort the products of the pairs in ascending order before finding the `K`-th smallest product.

**4. Using the wrong algorithm to find the `K`-th smallest product**

There are many different algorithms to find the `K`-th smallest element in a list. We should choose an algorithm that is efficient for our problem. For example, we can use a binary search algorithm.

Title:
ATCODER p02909 AtCoder Beginner Contest 141 - Weather Prediction

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly using the input format.** The input format is a string, so the developer should make sure to read the input as a string.
2. **Not understanding the problem statement.** The problem statement describes a cycle of weather patterns, so the developer should make sure to understand how the weather changes from day to day.
3. **Using incorrect logic to predict the weather.** The weather changes in a specific cycle, so the developer should use logic that reflects this cycle.
4. **Not handling edge cases.** The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input string is not one of the three valid weather conditions. The developer should handle this edge case by either returning an error or printing a default value.
5. **Not using proper error handling.** The developer should use proper error handling to ensure that the program does not crash if there is an error.

Title:
ATCODER p03186 AtCoder Grand Contest 030 - Poisonous Cookies

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable types**. The input is given as three integers, but the developer may accidentally store them as strings or floats. This would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the maximum number of tasty cookies that Takahashi can eat. For example, they may forget to take into account the fact that he can eat cookies containing antidotes even if he has a stomachache.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer may accidentally miscount the number of cookies that Takahashi can eat. For example, they may forget to include the first cookie in their calculation.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer may accidentally create objects that are never deleted, which can lead to a memory leak. This can cause the program to slow down or crash.
5. **Race conditions**. The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data, which can lead to race conditions. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer may accidentally introduce security vulnerabilities into the program. For example, they may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.

Title:
ATCODER p03333 AtCoder Grand Contest 025 - Interval Game

Pain points:
**1. Not handling the case where all segments are on the same line.**

In the example input, all segments are on the same line. If we simply iterate over the segments and add the distance between each segment, we will get the wrong answer of 10.

To fix this, we need to keep track of the minimum and maximum values of the segments. When we add a new segment, we need to update the minimum and maximum values accordingly. Then, we can simply add the distance between the minimum and maximum values to get the total distance traveled by Takahashi.

**2. Not handling the case where a segment is not completely contained in the previous segment.**

In the example input, the second segment is not completely contained in the first segment. If we simply iterate over the segments and add the distance between each segment, we will get the wrong answer of 12.

To fix this, we need to keep track of the previous segment. When we add a new segment, we need to check if the new segment is completely contained in the previous segment. If it is not, we need to add the distance between the end of the previous segment and the start of the new segment to the total distance traveled by Takahashi.

**3. Not handling the case where the last segment is not completely contained in the previous segment.**

In the example input, the last segment is not completely contained in the previous segment. If we simply iterate over the segments and add the distance between each segment, we will get the wrong answer of 34.

To fix this, we need to keep track of the previous segment. When we add the last segment, we need to check if the last segment is completely contained in the previous segment. If it is not, we need to add the distance between the end of the previous segment and the end of the last segment to the total distance traveled by Takahashi.

**4. Not handling the case where the input is invalid.**

In the example input, the first segment has a negative length. If we simply try to iterate over the segments, we will get an error.

To fix this, we need to check if the input is valid before we try to iterate over the segments. If the input is invalid, we need to print an error message and exit the program.

Title:
ATCODER p03492 AtCoder Regular Contest 087 - Squirrel Migration

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. Make sure that you are correctly traversing the tree and visiting all of the vertices.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the distance between two vertices.** The distance between two vertices is the number of edges in the path between them. Make sure that you are correctly counting the number of edges in the path.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the total distance traveled by the squirrels.** The total distance traveled by the squirrels is the sum of the distances between each pair of vertices. Make sure that you are correctly adding up the distances.
4. **Incorrect modulo operation.** When calculating the final answer, you need to make sure that you are correctly performing the modulo operation. This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect use of the 10^9 + 7 mod operator.** The 10^9 + 7 mod operator is a special operator that allows you to perform modulo arithmetic on large numbers. Make sure that you are correctly using this operator.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. **Use a well-tested tree traversal algorithm.** There are many different tree traversal algorithms available, so choose one that has been well-tested and is known to be correct.
2. **Use a well-tested algorithm for calculating the distance between two vertices.** There are many different algorithms for calculating the distance between two vertices, so choose one that has been well-tested and is known to be correct.
3. **Use a well-tested algorithm for calculating the total distance traveled by the squirrels.** There are many different algorithms for calculating the total distance traveled by the squirrels, so choose one that has been well-tested and is known to be correct.
4. **Be careful when performing modulo operations.** The modulo operation is a tricky operation that can easily lead to errors. Make sure that you are correctly using the modulo operator and that you are not accidentally overflowing the bounds of your data type.
5. **Use the 10^9 + 7 mod operator correctly.** The 10^9 + 7 mod operator is a special operator that allows you to perform modulo arithmetic on large numbers. Make sure that you are correctly using this operator and that you are not accidentally overflowing the bounds of your data type.

Title:
ATCODER p03654 AtCoder Grand Contest 018 - Tree and Hamilton Path

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is `5`, `1 2 5`, `3 4 7`, `2 3 3`, `2 5`, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly and will output an incorrect result.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong data type, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is `5`, `1 2 a`, `3 4 7`, `2 3 3`, `2 5`, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly and will output an incorrect result.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, a naive algorithm that tries to find all possible Hamiltonian paths in the complete graph and then selects the longest one is likely to be incorrect, as it will not take into account the fact that some Hamiltonian paths may be shorter than others.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. The program may be incorrectly implemented, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program uses a data structure that is not efficient for the problem being solved, the program may run slowly and output an incorrect result.
5. **Incorrect testing**. The program may not be tested thoroughly, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may be tested on only a small number of test cases, which may not be enough to catch all of the bugs.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully follow the input format, use the correct data types, use an efficient algorithm, implement the program correctly, and test the program thoroughly.

Title:
ATCODER p03810 AtCoder Grand Contest 010 - Decrementing

Pain points:
**1. Not handling the case where all numbers are equal.**

In the problem statement, it is mentioned that the greatest common divisor of the integers is 1. However, the input format does not explicitly state that all numbers must be different. This could lead to a bug where the program assumes that all numbers are different and incorrectly determines the winner.

To avoid this bug, the program should check if all numbers are equal before determining the winner. If all numbers are equal, the program should print "Second".

**2. Not handling the case where the greatest common divisor of the numbers is not 1.**

The problem statement states that the greatest common divisor of the integers is 1. However, the input format does not explicitly state that the greatest common divisor must be 1. This could lead to a bug where the program incorrectly determines the winner if the greatest common divisor of the numbers is not 1.

To avoid this bug, the program should check if the greatest common divisor of the numbers is 1 before determining the winner. If the greatest common divisor is not 1, the program should print "Second".

**3. Not handling the case where the input is invalid.**

The input format for this problem is very specific. If the input is not in the correct format, the program could crash or produce incorrect results.

To avoid this bug, the program should check the input for validity before processing it. If the input is invalid, the program should print an error message and exit.

**4. Not handling the case where the program runs out of memory.**

The program could run out of memory if the input is very large. To avoid this, the program should use a memory-efficient data structure to store the integers.

**5. Not handling the case where the program runs out of time.**

The program could run out of time if the input is very large. To avoid this, the program should use a time-efficient algorithm to solve the problem.

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading in the input data. For example, if you forget to include a newline character between the two parts of a search query, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format for this problem is also very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when printing the results of your search queries. For example, if you forget to include a newline character between the two parts of a search query, the program will not be able to print the output correctly.
* **Incorrect use of the retrieval device:** The retrieval device in this problem is a powerful tool, but it is also easy to misuse. For example, if you try to search for a sub-blackboard that is not contained in the blackboard, the device will return an incorrect result.
* **Excessive use of the retrieval device:** The retrieval device in this problem has a limited number of queries that it can process. If you use too many queries, the device will eventually stop working and you will not be able to solve the problem.
* **Inefficient search strategy:** The goal of this problem is to find the smallest sub-blackboard that contains all of the used cells in the blackboard. If you use an inefficient search strategy, you may end up finding a sub-blackboard that is much larger than necessary.

By avoiding these common problems and bugs, you can increase your chances of solving this problem successfully.

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading the input data. For example, if you forget to include a newline character between datasets, the program will likely crash.
* **Incorrect output format.** The output for this problem should be a single integer, representing the number of islands in the input data. If you output the wrong format, the program will likely produce an incorrect answer.
* **Incorrect logic.** The logic for solving this problem is not trivial, and it's easy to make a mistake. For example, if you forget to check for boundary conditions, the program may crash.
* **Incorrect data structures.** The data structures used to solve this problem are important, and it's easy to make a mistake when choosing the wrong data structure. For example, if you use a list to store the grid data, the program may run slowly.
* **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm used to solve this problem is important, and it's easy to make a mistake when choosing the wrong algorithm. For example, if you use a brute-force algorithm, the program may run very slowly.

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correctly specified, which can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
* **Incorrect data type:** The data type of the input values may not be correct, which can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
* **Off-by-one errors:** The program may incorrectly calculate the index of a seat or the number of seats that are occupied, which can cause the final seating arrangement to be incorrect.
* **Logic errors:** The program may have incorrect logic, which can cause the final seating arrangement to be incorrect.
* **Memory leaks:** The program may not properly release memory that is no longer needed, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
* **Race conditions:** The program may not be thread-safe, which can cause incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data simultaneously.

By carefully following the instructions and avoiding these common problems, you can write a program that correctly solves the problem of calculating the final seating arrangement of the passengers.

AIZU p01731 Thread Tree

Pain points:
1. The input format is not very clear. For example, it is not clear whether the first line of the input is the number of posts or the index of the first post.
2. The output format is not very clear. For example, it is not clear how to represent the depth of a post.
3. The code is not very efficient. For example, it uses a nested loop to iterate over all the posts, which is very inefficient.
4. The code is not very modular. For example, the code for printing the tree is not separated from the code for reading the input.
5. The code is not very robust. For example, it does not handle errors very well.

Here are some possible solutions to these problems:

1. The input format can be made more clear by using a different format, such as JSON or XML.
2. The output format can be made more clear by using a different format, such as a tree diagram or a graph.
3. The code can be made more efficient by using a more efficient algorithm, such as a breadth-first search or a depth-first search.
4. The code can be made more modular by separating the code for reading the input from the code for printing the tree.
5. The code can be made more robust by handling errors more gracefully.

AIZU p02006 Santa's Gift

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may not be able to parse it correctly.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The input data may be of the wrong type, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program may not be able to parse it correctly.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** The program may incorrectly calculate the size or price of a gift, which may result in an incorrect answer. For example, if the program incorrectly calculates the size of a gift as 1 instead of 2, the program may pack too many gifts into the bag and exceed the capacity.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The program may have incorrect logic, which may result in an incorrect answer. For example, the program may not take into account the fact that children are unhappy if they are given multiple items of the same kind gift, or that Santa must distribute gifts fairly to all the children of a family.
5. **Memory leaks.** The program may not release memory that it has allocated, which may eventually lead to a memory leak. A memory leak can cause the program to run slowly or crash.
6. **Race conditions.** The program may not be thread-safe, which may cause incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.
7. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program may contain security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or SQL injection vulnerabilities, which may allow attackers to exploit the program and gain unauthorized access to the system.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design and implement the program, and to test it thoroughly before deploying it to production.

Title:
AIZU p02150 Milk

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input constraints state that $a$, $b$, and $x$ are all integers between $1$ and $10^{15}$. However, if you try to store these values as integers, you may run into problems when they are too large. For example, the integer value of $10^{15}$ is too large for most programming languages to handle.

To avoid this problem, you should use a data type that is capable of storing large integers. In Python, you can use the `long` type. In Java, you can use the `BigInteger` class.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The naive algorithm for solving this problem is to repeatedly divide $x$ by $a$ and $b$ until $x$ is zero. However, this algorithm is very inefficient, as it requires a large number of divisions.

A more efficient algorithm is to use the following formula:

```
ans = (x // a) * (b - 1) + (x % a)
```

This formula takes advantage of the fact that $x$ is always divisible by $a$ or $b$.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When computing the remainder of a division, it is important to be careful about off-by-one errors. For example, if you divide $10$ by $3$, the remainder is $1$. However, if you subtract $1$ from $10$ before dividing, the remainder is $0$.

To avoid this problem, you should always make sure that the dividend is at least as large as the divisor.

**4. Using incorrect modulo arithmetic**

When computing the remainder of a division, it is important to use the correct modulo arithmetic operator. In Python, the modulo operator is `%`. In Java, the modulo operator is `%`.

**5. Using floating-point numbers**

Floating-point numbers are not always accurate, so you should avoid using them when working with large integers.

In Python, you can convert an integer to a floating-point number using the `float()` function. In Java, you can convert an integer to a floating-point number using the `doubleValue()` method.
Test inputs:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

```
a, b, x = map(int, input().split())
print((x // a) * (b - 1) + (x % a))
```

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

```
a, b, x = map(int, input().split())
ans = 0
while x > 0:
    if x >= a:
        x -= a
        ans += (b - 1)
    else:
        x -= b
    ans += x
print(ans % 1000000007)
```

**3. Off-by-one errors**

```
a, b, x = map(int, input().split())
print((x // a) * (b - 1) + (x % a))
```

**4. Using incorrect modulo arithmetic**

```
a, b, x = map(int, input().split())
print((x // a) * (b - 1) + (x % a) % 1000000007)
```

**5. Using floating-point numbers**
