CODECHEF egbobrd

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly calculating the number of pieces of bread that are left after a package is opened.** This can happen if the developer does not take into account the fact that the last piece of bread in a package becomes bad each day. To avoid this bug, the developer should keep track of the number of good pieces of bread that are left in a package after each day.
2. **Incorrectly calculating the minimum number of packages of bread that are needed.** This can happen if the developer does not take into account the fact that the chefs may need to open more than one package of bread on a given day. To avoid this bug, the developer should keep track of the number of good pieces of bread that are left in each package after each day, and only open a new package if there are not enough good pieces of bread left in any of the existing packages.
3. **Using an incorrect data type to store the number of pieces of bread that are left in a package.** This can happen if the developer does not take into account the fact that the number of pieces of bread that are left in a package can be very large. To avoid this bug, the developer should use a data type that is capable of storing large numbers.
4. **Using an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem.** There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. The developer should choose an algorithm that is efficient and that is guaranteed to find the correct answer.
5. **Not testing the code thoroughly.** This is the most common cause of bugs in any program. The developer should write a comprehensive set of test cases to ensure that the code is working correctly.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The developer may incorrectly type the variable type, which would lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may declare the variable `n` as an integer, but then accidentally assign a string to it. This would cause the program to crash.
2. **Off-by-one error:** The developer may make an off-by-one error when iterating through the input or output data. This could lead to incorrect results or a crash. For example, the developer may iterate through the input data one element too many or one element too few.
3. **Incorrect logic:** The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program. This could lead to incorrect results or a crash. For example, the developer may incorrectly check if a condition is true or false.
4. **Memory leak:** The developer may create a memory leak, which is a situation where memory is allocated but never freed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing. For example, the developer may create a new object but never delete it.
5. **Race condition:** The developer may create a race condition, which is a situation where two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or a crash. For example, the developer may try to update a variable in one thread while another thread is also trying to update it.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect graph representation**. The input graph may not be represented correctly. For example, it may contain multiple edges between the same two vertices or self-loops.
2. **Incorrect edge traversal**. The algorithm for traversing the graph may not be correct. For example, it may miss some edges or visit the same edge multiple times.
3. **Incorrect tree identification**. The algorithm for identifying trees in the graph may not be correct. For example, it may identify a tree that is not actually a tree or it may miss a tree that is actually present in the graph.
4. **Incorrect simple cycle identification**. The algorithm for identifying simple cycles in the graph may not be correct. For example, it may identify a cycle that is not actually a simple cycle or it may miss a simple cycle that is actually present in the graph.
5. **Incorrect Cthulhu identification**. The algorithm for identifying Cthulhu graphs may not be correct. For example, it may identify a graph that is not actually Cthulhu or it may miss a graph that is actually Cthulhu.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1093_F. Vasya and Array

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the modulo operator.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. Make sure that you are using the correct modulo operator for your programming language. For example, in Python, the modulo operator is `%`, while in Java, it is `%`.
2. **Incorrect handling of negative numbers.** When working with arrays of integers, it is important to be aware of the fact that negative numbers can wrap around when they are modded by a positive number. For example, if you have an array of integers from -10 to 10 and you mod each element by 10, the element -10 will become 0, and the element 10 will become 10. This can lead to incorrect results if you are not careful.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When working with arrays, it is easy to make off-by-one errors. For example, if you are trying to find the index of the first element in an array that is equal to a certain value, you might accidentally start your search at the wrong index. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect use of the array bounds.** When working with arrays, it is important to be aware of the array bounds. For example, if you are trying to access an element of an array that is out of bounds, your program will likely crash.
5. **Incorrect use of the array size.** When working with arrays, it is important to be aware of the array size. For example, if you are trying to iterate over an array that is larger than the array size, your program will likely crash.
6. **Incorrect use of the array data type.** When working with arrays, it is important to be aware of the array data type. For example, if you are trying to store integers in an array that is declared as a string array, your program will likely crash.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these common problems:

* Use a debugger to help you track down errors.
* Test your code thoroughly with a variety of input data.
* Use the documentation for your programming language to learn about the correct way to use the modulo operator, negative numbers, and arrays.
* Be careful when using off-by-one errors, array bounds, and array data types.

CODEFORCES 1113_F. Sasha and Interesting Fact from Graph Theory

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.** The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a well-known algorithm for finding the shortest paths in a weighted graph. However, it is important to implement it correctly, as a mistake can lead to incorrect results. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
def floyd_warshall(graph):
  """
  Computes the shortest paths in a weighted graph.

  Args:
    graph: A list of lists, where each inner list represents an adjacency list for a vertex.

  Returns:
    A list of lists, where each inner list represents the shortest paths from the corresponding vertex to all other vertices.
  """

  n = len(graph)
  dist = [[float("inf") for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
  for i in range(n):
    dist[i][i] = 0
  for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
      for k in range(n):
        dist[j][k] = min(dist[j][k], dist[j][i] + dist[i][k])
  return dist

```

The problem with this code is that it does not take into account the fact that the shortest path from a vertex to itself is always 0. This can lead to incorrect results, such as the following:

```
graph = [[0, 1, 2], [1, 0, 3], [2, 3, 0]]
print(floyd_warshall(graph))
```

```
[[0, 1, 2], [1, 0, 3], [2, 3, 0]]
```

The correct implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm should take into account the fact that the shortest path from a vertex to itself is always 0. This can be done by adding the following line to the algorithm:

```
for i in range(n):
  dist[i][i] = 0
```

2. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) is used to find the remainder of a division. For example, 10 % 3 = 1, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1. However, it is important to use the modulo operator correctly, as a mistake can lead to incorrect results. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
def count_beautiful_trees(n, m, a, b):
  """
  Counts the number of beautiful trees in a graph.

  Args:
    n: The number of vertices in the graph.
    m: The maximum weight of an edge in the graph.
    a: The first favorite vertex.
    b: The second favorite vertex.

  Returns:
    The number of beautiful trees in the graph.
  """

  # Create a graph.
  graph = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
  for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
      if i != j:

  # Find the shortest path between a and b.
  dist = floyd_warshall(graph)
  d = dist[a][b]

  # Count the number of beautiful trees.
  count = 0
  for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
      if i != j and d == dist[i][j]:
        count += 1

  return count % 10**9 + 7

```

The problem with this code is that it uses the modulo operator incorrectly. The modulo operator should be used to find the remainder of a division, but in this case, it is being used to find the remainder of an addition. This can lead to incorrect results, such as the following:

```
n = 5
m = 10
a = 1
b = 5
print(count_beautiful_trees(n, m, a, b))
```

```

The correct implementation of the code should use the modulo operator correctly, as follows:

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correct. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or the input may be missing a newline character.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correct. For example, the output may contain a non-integer value, or the output may not be two integers separated by a space.
* **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of stops:** The minimum number of stops is not calculated correctly. For example, the minimum number of stops may be calculated as the distance between the two cities instead of the number of cities between them.
* **Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of stops:** The maximum number of stops is not calculated correctly. For example, the maximum number of stops may be calculated as the distance between the two cities instead of the number of cities between them.
* **Incorrect handling of edge cases:** The code may not handle edge cases correctly. For example, the code may not work correctly if the number of cities is 1 or if the distance between the two cities is 0.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly for all possible inputs.

CODEFORCES 1162_C. Hide and Seek

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains two integers n and k. If we use int to store n and k, we may get wrong results when n and k are large. For example, if n = 10^5 and k = 10^5, then n * k will overflow int. We should use long long to store n and k.

**2. Not considering the boundary conditions**

The problem states that "Alice can even move her token before answering the first question or after answering the last question". So we should consider the boundary conditions when counting the number of scenarios.

**3. Using incorrect formulas**

The problem states that "Alice acted in such a way that she was able to answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions". So we should only count the scenarios where Alice can answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions.

**4. Making mistakes in the implementation**

The implementation of the algorithm is also prone to mistakes. We should carefully check the implementation to avoid making mistakes.

**5. Not handling errors correctly**

The problem may contain errors. We should handle errors correctly to avoid getting wrong results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1183_B. Equalize Prices

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very strict. It allows for multiple spaces between numbers, and it also allows for leading and trailing spaces. However, if the input format is not followed correctly, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly and will produce an incorrect output.

For example, the following input is incorrect:

```
5 1
1 1 2 3 1
```

The correct input should be:

```
5 1
1 1 2 3 1
```

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also not very strict. It allows for multiple spaces between numbers, and it also allows for leading and trailing spaces. However, if the output format is not followed correctly, the program will not be able to parse the output correctly and will produce an incorrect result.

For example, the following output is incorrect:

```
2
6
-1
7
```

The correct output should be:

```
2
6
-1
7
```

**3. Using incorrect data types**

The problem statement specifies that the input and output should be integers. However, if the program does not use the correct data types, the program will not be able to correctly process the input and output data.

For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

max_price = max(a)

print(max_price - k)
```

This code will produce an error because the `max()` function cannot be used with a list of strings. To fix this, the code should be changed to use the `max()` function with a list of integers.

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

max_price = max(a)

print(max_price - k)
```

**4. Using incorrect algorithms**

The problem statement specifies that the goal is to find the maximum possible equal price B of all products such that the condition |a_i - B| ≤ k is satisfied for all products. However, if the program uses an incorrect algorithm, it may not be able to find the maximum possible value of B.

For example, the following algorithm will not work correctly:

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

max_price = max(a)

for i in range(n):
    if abs(a[i] - max_price) > k:
        print(-1)
        exit()

print(max_price)
```

This algorithm will not work correctly because it does not consider the case where all of the products have a price that is greater than k. In this case, the algorithm will print -1 even though there is a possible solution.

To fix this, the algorithm should be changed to check if all of the products have a price that is greater than k. If all of the products have a price that is greater than k, then the algorithm should print -1.

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

max_price = max(a)

if max(a) > k:
    print(-1)
    exit()

print(max_price)
```

**5. Using inefficient algorithms**

The problem statement specifies that the input contains n products, where n is at most 100. This means that the program can use an algorithm that is O(n) in time complexity. However, if the program uses an algorithm that is O(n^2) in time complexity, it will not be able to solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time.

For example, the following algorithm is O(n^2) in time complexity:

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

max_price = max(a)

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        if abs(a[i] - a[j]) > k:
            print(-1)
            exit()

print(max_price)
```

This algorithm can be improved to O(n) in time complexity by using a binary search.

CODEFORCES 1200_C. Round Corridor

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of sectors in the inner area is not a positive integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the distance between two sectors**. The distance between two sectors is not always calculated correctly, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the two sectors are on opposite sides of the corridor, the program may incorrectly calculate the distance as zero.
3. **Incorrect checking of whether a wall exists between two sectors**. The program may incorrectly check whether a wall exists between two sectors, which can lead to errors in the output. For example, if the two sectors are in different areas, the program may incorrectly check that there is no wall between them.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the output is not in all capital letters, the program may be marked as incorrect.
5. **Other errors**. There are a number of other possible errors that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include errors in the logic of the program, errors in the implementation of the algorithms, and errors in the testing of the program.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1218_E. Product Tuples

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the `F(B, K)` function.** This function should calculate the sum of products of all `K`-tuples of elements in the array `B`. A common mistake is to calculate the sum of products of all `K`-tuples of elements in the original array `A`.
2. **Incorrect handling of queries of type 1.** When a query of type 1 is processed, the value of `A[i]` is temporarily changed to `d`. However, it is important to remember to restore the original value of `A[i]` after the query has been processed. Otherwise, the results of subsequent queries may be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect handling of queries of type 2.** When a query of type 2 is processed, the values of `A[i]` for all `i` in the range `[L, R]` inclusive are temporarily changed to `A[i] + d`. However, it is important to remember to restore the original values of `A[i]` after the query has been processed. Otherwise, the results of subsequent queries may be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect modular arithmetic.** When calculating the sum of products of `K`-tuples, it is important to use modular arithmetic. Otherwise, the results may be incorrect.
5. **Incorrect use of the `998244353` modulus.** The `998244353` modulus is a prime number that is often used in cryptography. It is important to use this modulus correctly when calculating the sum of products of `K`-tuples. Otherwise, the results may be incorrect.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements. It is also important to carefully implement the `F(B, K)` function and to correctly handle queries of types 1 and 2. Finally, it is important to use modular arithmetic correctly and to use the `998244353` modulus correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1302_J. Keep talking and nobody explodes – hard

Pain points:
**Possible Problems and Bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format**. The input should be a string of exactly 100 digits, leading zeroes are allowed. If the input is not in the correct format, the program will not work correctly.
* **Incorrect logic**. The logic for each operation is complex and error-prone. If there is a mistake in the logic, the program will not work correctly.
* **Off-by-one errors**. The program uses many loops and conditional statements, which are prone to off-by-one errors. If there is an off-by-one error, the program will not work correctly.
* **Memory errors**. The program needs to store the original input string, the intermediate results of each operation, and the final output string. If there is not enough memory available, the program will crash.
* **Timeout errors**. The program needs to perform a large number of operations on the input string. If the program does not finish running within a reasonable amount of time, it will timeout and the output will be incorrect.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format, the logic of the program, and the memory usage. It is also important to test the program thoroughly with a variety of inputs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1327_A. Sum of Odd Integers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) — the number of test cases. However, if the input contains fewer than t test cases, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that for each test case, the program should print the answer — "YES" (without quotes) if n can be represented as a sum of k distinct positive odd (not divisible by 2) integers and "NO" otherwise. However, if the program prints the answer in the wrong format, it will receive a wrong answer.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The program must check if n can be represented as a sum of k distinct positive odd (not divisible by 2) integers. One way to do this is to iterate over all possible combinations of k positive odd integers and check if their sum is equal to n. However, this approach is inefficient, as it will take O(k^2) time to check all possible combinations. A more efficient approach is to use the following formula:

```
n = k * (k - 1) / 2
```

where n is the number of odd integers and k is the number of distinct positive odd integers. If n is divisible by this formula, then it can be represented as a sum of k distinct positive odd integers. Otherwise, it cannot be represented as a sum of k distinct positive odd integers.

4. **Memory leaks.** The program must not allocate any memory that it does not need. If the program allocates memory that it does not need, it will eventually run out of memory and crash.

5. **Synchronization issues.** If the program is multi-threaded, it must ensure that all threads access shared resources in a synchronized manner. If the program does not do this, it may experience race conditions, which can lead to incorrect results or crashes.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect variable type**. The variables used in the program must be of the correct type. For example, if a variable is declared as an integer but is assigned a string value, the program may crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be correct. For example, if the program is supposed to find the minimum of two numbers, but it instead finds the maximum, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Indexing errors**. Indexing errors occur when a programmer accesses an element of an array or list using an incorrect index. This can lead to incorrect results or a crash.
6. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when a programmer allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to a program running out of memory and crashing.
7. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or a crash.
8. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can lead to a program being stuck in an infinite loop.
9. **Buffer overflows**. Buffer overflows occur when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold. This can lead to a program crashing or executing arbitrary code.
10. **Format string vulnerabilities**. Format string vulnerabilities occur when a program uses a format string that is not properly sanitized. This can lead to a program being exploited by an attacker.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer t, which is the number of test cases. However, if the input format is incorrect, such as if the first line contains two integers instead of one, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that for each test case, the program should print a single integer, which is the minimum number of characters that need to be erased from the input string to make it good. However, if the output format is incorrect, such as if the program prints two integers instead of one, the grader will not be able to properly evaluate the program.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not correctly identify all of the characters that need to be erased from the input string in order to make it good. This could result in the program producing incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect data structures**. The data structures used to store the input data and the output data may be incorrect. For example, if the input data is stored in a linked list, the program may not be able to efficiently access the data. This could result in the program running slowly or producing incorrect output.
5. **Incorrect error handling**. The program may not handle errors correctly. For example, if the input data is invalid, the program may crash or produce incorrect output. This could result in the program being unable to complete the task that it was designed to do.
6. **Incorrect testing**. The program may not be adequately tested. This could result in the program producing incorrect output or crashing. It is important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it is working correctly.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to develop a correct algorithm and use the correct data structures. Finally, it is important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it is working correctly.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format specifies that the first line of each test case should contain a single integer n, which is the length of the string s. However, some test cases may not have this format. For example, the following test case would be incorrectly formatted:

```

This test case does not have a single integer on the first line. As a result, your code may crash or produce incorrect output.

To avoid this problem, you should check the input format before processing it. You can do this by using the `int(input())` function to convert the input to an integer. If the input cannot be converted to an integer, you should raise an exception.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format specifies that you should print a single integer on each line, which is the maximum number of operations you can perform. However, some test cases may require you to print more than one integer. For example, the following test case would require you to print two integers:

```
1
101010
```

In this case, you should print the maximum number of operations you can perform on the first line, and then print the length of the string s on the second line.

To avoid this problem, you should check the output format before printing it. You can do this by using the `print()` function to print each integer on a separate line.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm you use to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the following algorithm would be incorrect:

```
def solve(s):
  # Get the length of the string.
  n = len(s)

  # Iterate over the string from left to right.
  for i in range(n):
    # If the current character is 0, delete it.
    if s[i] == '0':
      s = s[:i] + s[i + 1:]

  # Return the length of the string.
  return len(s)
```

This algorithm would not work because it does not consider the possibility that the string may contain multiple consecutive 0s. To fix this, you would need to add a check to see if the current character is the same as the previous character. If it is, you would need to delete both characters.

**4. Incorrect data structures**

The data structures you use to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the following data structure would be incorrect:

```
def solve(s):
  # Create a list to store the characters in the string.
  chars = []

  # Iterate over the string from left to right.
  for char in s:
    # Add the current character to the list.
    chars.append(char)

  # Return the length of the list.
  return len(chars)
```

This data structure would not work because it does not take into account the possibility that the string may contain multiple consecutive characters. To fix this, you would need to use a different data structure, such as a set.

**5. Incorrect implementation**

The implementation of your code may be incorrect. For example, the following implementation would be incorrect:

```
def solve(s):
  # Get the length of the string.
  n = len(s)

  # Iterate over the string from left to right.
  for i in range(n):
    # If the current character is 0, delete it.
    if s[i] == '0':
      s = s[:i] + s[i + 1:]

  # Return the length of the string.
  return len(s)


if __name__ == '__main__':
  # Get the number of test cases.
  t = int(input())

  # Iterate over the test cases.
  for _ in range(t):
    # Get the length of the string.
    n = int(input())

    # Get the string.
    s = input()

    # Solve the problem.
    print(solve(s))
```

This implementation would not work because it does not check if the input is valid. To fix this, you would need to add a check to see if the input is a valid integer.
Test inputs:
**Incorrect input format**

101010

1. **Incorrectly counting the number of 0s and 1s in a prefix.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. Be sure to carefully count the number of 0s and 1s in each prefix, and make sure that the number of 0s and 1s is equal.
2. **Not considering all possible prefixes.** When trying to transform a string into another string, it is important to consider all possible prefixes. For example, in the example problem, the prefix of length 4 is illegal because it has three 0s and one 1.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. Be sure to use an algorithm that is correct and efficient.
4. **Making a runtime error.** This can happen if you do not allocate enough memory for your data structures, or if you make a mistake in your code. Be sure to carefully check your code for errors before running it.

CODEFORCES 201_C. Fragile Bridges

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer `n` (the number of platforms) and the second line should contain `n - 1` integers (the number of bridges). However, the input may contain a different number of lines, or the lines may contain non-integer values.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the output should be a single integer (the maximum number of points). However, the output may contain multiple integers, or non-integer values.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of points.** The maximum number of points is the sum of the number of transitions that can be made on each bridge. However, the developer may incorrectly calculate the number of transitions, or may not account for the fact that the hero cannot move back across a bridge that has already been crossed.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** The developer may incorrectly calculate the indices of the bridges or the platforms. This can result in the hero being unable to move across a bridge or being able to move across a bridge multiple times.
5. **Memory errors.** The developer may allocate too much or too little memory for the input data or the intermediate results. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
6. **Synchronization errors.** The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data between multiple threads. This can lead to data corruption or incorrect results.
7. **Exception handling errors.** The developer may not properly handle exceptions that are thrown by the program. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
8. **Security vulnerabilities.** The developer may not properly protect the program from malicious input. This can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or its data.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully review the input format and output format, and ensure that they correctly calculate the maximum number of points. They should also be careful to avoid off-by-one errors, memory errors, synchronization errors, exception handling errors, and security vulnerabilities.

CODEFORCES 226_B. Naughty Stone Piles

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data contains a lot of integers. If you use the wrong data type to store them, you may get incorrect results. For example, if you use `int` to store integers larger than `2147483647`, you will get incorrect results.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks you to find the minimum cost to gather all stones in one pile. There are many possible algorithms to solve this problem. You need to choose the right algorithm for the problem. For example, if you use a brute-force algorithm to solve this problem, you will get TLE.

**3. Not handling corner cases**

The problem statement mentions some corner cases. You need to make sure that your code handles these corner cases correctly. For example, the problem statement mentions that the piles can have different sizes. You need to make sure that your code can handle piles of different sizes.

CODEFORCES 24_E. Berland collider

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem states that the first line should contain a single integer n, which is the number of particles in the collider. However, if the input contains an incorrect number of values, such as a string instead of an integer, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem states that the output should be a single number, which is the time in seconds until the big bang occurs. However, if the output is not a number, or if it is not formatted correctly, the program will not produce the correct answer.

**3. Undefined behavior**

The problem does not specify what should happen if there are no particles in the collider, or if all of the particles have the same velocity. In these cases, the program may produce undefined behavior, such as crashing or printing an incorrect answer.

**4. Floating-point errors**

The problem states that the answer must have a relative or absolute error less than 10-9. This is a very small tolerance, and it is possible that the program will produce an answer that is slightly outside of this range due to floating-point rounding errors.

**5. Insufficient time complexity**

The problem states that the solution must run in O(n) time, where n is the number of particles in the collider. However, if the program takes more than O(n) time to run, it will not be able to solve the problem in a timely manner.

Title:
CODEFORCES 298_C. Parity Game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly checking the parity of a string.** The parity of a string can be checked by using the following formula:

```
parity(s) = (number of 1s in s) mod 2
```

For example, the parity of the string "01011" is 1 because there are 5 1s in the string, and 5 mod 2 is 1.

2. **Not considering the empty string.** The empty string is a valid 01-string, and it has a parity of 0. This means that if a is the empty string, then it is always possible to turn it into b, regardless of the value of b.

3. **Not handling the case where a is longer than b.** If a is longer than b, then it is not possible to turn a into b. This is because any operation that removes a character from a will make it shorter than b.

4. **Not handling the case where a and b have different parities.** If a and b have different parities, then it is not possible to turn a into b. This is because any operation that changes the parity of a will also change the parity of b.

5. **Not handling the case where a and b are equal.** If a and b are equal, then it is trivially possible to turn a into b. This is because any operation that does not change a will still result in a string that is equal to b.

Title:
CODEFORCES 321_A. Ciel and Robot

Pain points:
**1. Mismatch of input format.** The input format specifies that the first line contains two integers a and b, and the second line contains a string s. However, a developer may accidentally write the input format as follows:

```
The first line contains two integers a and b, and the second line contains a string s.
```

This will cause the program to crash when it tries to read the second line of input.

**2. Incorrect use of comparison operators.** The problem states that the robot will do the operations in s from left to right, and repeat it infinite times. This means that the robot's position will eventually reach a cycle. A developer may accidentally compare the robot's position to the target position before the cycle has been reached, and the program will output the wrong answer.

**3. Incorrect use of loops.** The problem requires the developer to use a loop to iterate over the robot's movements. A developer may accidentally use the wrong type of loop, or they may forget to initialize the loop variable. This will cause the program to crash or output the wrong answer.

**4. Incorrect use of functions.** The problem requires the developer to use functions to calculate the robot's position after each movement. A developer may accidentally use the wrong function, or they may forget to call the function. This will cause the program to crash or output the wrong answer.

**5. Incorrect use of variables.** The problem requires the developer to use variables to store the robot's position and the target position. A developer may accidentally use the wrong type of variable, or they may forget to initialize the variable. This will cause the program to crash or output the wrong answer.

**6. Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem does not require the developer to use any data structures. However, a developer may accidentally use a data structure that is not necessary, or they may use the data structure incorrectly. This will cause the program to run slower than necessary or output the wrong answer.

**7. Incorrect use of algorithms.** The problem does not require the developer to use any specific algorithms. However, a developer may accidentally use an algorithm that is not efficient, or they may use the algorithm incorrectly. This will cause the program to run slower than necessary or output the wrong answer.

Title:
CODEFORCES 606_E. Freelancer's Dreams

Pain points:
**1. Using floating-point numbers**

The problem statement requires the output to be a real value, which means that we need to use floating-point numbers. However, floating-point numbers are not precise, and this can lead to errors in our calculations. For example, if we try to calculate the square root of 2 using floating-point numbers, we will get an answer of approximately 1.414213562373095, which is not exactly the true value of √2 (which is 1.4142135623730950488016887242097).

This error can be a problem when solving this problem, because we need to find the minimum number of days that Mikhail needs to work in order to achieve his goals. If we use floating-point numbers, we may get an answer that is not accurate enough.

**2. Using the wrong data type**

Another potential problem is using the wrong data type. For example, if we try to store the number of days that Mikhail needs to work as an integer, we may get an overflow error. This is because the maximum value of an integer is 2147483647, and the number of days that Mikhail needs to work could be greater than this.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement does not specify what to do in the case where Mikhail does not have enough experience or money to achieve his goals. We need to make sure that our solution handles these edge cases correctly.

**4. Not being efficient enough**

The problem statement asks us to find the minimum number of days that Mikhail needs to work in order to achieve his goals. This means that we need to find the optimal solution. If our solution is not efficient enough, it may take a long time to run, and we may not get the correct answer.

**5. Not using the right algorithms**

There are a number of different algorithms that we could use to solve this problem. We need to make sure that we use the right algorithm for the problem at hand. If we use the wrong algorithm, it may take a long time to run, and we may not get the correct answer.

**6. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it. This will help you to catch any errors in your code and make sure that it is correct.

CODEFORCES 678_D. Iterated Linear Function

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input value n can be too large, so you should use a 64-bit integer type to store it. In C++, you can use the `long long` integer type and in Java you can use the `long` integer type.

**2. Not using modular arithmetic**

The output should be the value of `g(n)(x)` modulo `10^9 + 7`. Make sure to use modular arithmetic to calculate the output.

**3. Using incorrect formulas**

The formulas for calculating `g(n)(x)` are:

```
g(0)(x) = x
g(n)(x) = f(g(n - 1)(x)) = A * g(n - 1)(x) + B
```

Make sure to use these formulas correctly.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

Be careful when calculating the indices of `g(n)(x)`. The index of `g(n)(x)` is `n`, not `n - 1`.

**5. Incorrect indentation**

Make sure your code is properly indented. This will help you to avoid errors.

**6. Using incorrect variable names**

Use descriptive variable names to make your code easier to read and understand.

**7. Not commenting your code**

CODEFORCES 838_B. Diverging Directions

Pain points:
12 The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are:

* **Incorrect implementation of the Dijkstra's algorithm.** The Dijkstra's algorithm is a very powerful algorithm for finding the shortest paths in a graph. However, it is important to implement the algorithm correctly, otherwise the results may be incorrect.
* **Incorrect handling of negative edge weights.** The Dijkstra's algorithm can only be used on graphs with non-negative edge weights. If the graph contains negative edge weights, the algorithm may not terminate or may produce incorrect results.
* **Incorrect handling of parallel edges.** The Dijkstra's algorithm can only be used on graphs with no parallel edges. If the graph contains parallel edges, the algorithm may not terminate or may produce incorrect results.
* **Incorrect handling of self-loops.** The Dijkstra's algorithm can only be used on graphs with no self-loops. If the graph contains self-loops, the algorithm may not terminate or may produce incorrect results.
* **Incorrect handling of disconnected graphs.** The Dijkstra's algorithm can only be used on connected graphs. If the graph is disconnected, the algorithm may not terminate or may produce incorrect results.

By avoiding these common problems and bugs, you can ensure that your implementation of the Dijkstra's algorithm is correct and produces the correct results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 907_F. Power Tower

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem statement is quite long and detailed, so it is important to read it carefully and make sure you understand all the requirements. A common mistake is to assume that the rocks are added from the first to the last, when in fact they are added from the last to the first.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for computing the cumulative power of a tower is quite simple, but it is important to implement it correctly. A common mistake is to use the wrong modulo operator, or to forget to carry over the carry when adding two numbers.
3. **Incorrect input/output.** The input and output for this problem are both formatted as text. It is important to make sure that you are reading and writing the input and output correctly. A common mistake is to forget to convert the input numbers to the correct type, or to output the wrong number of digits.
4. **Runtime errors.** The algorithm for computing the cumulative power of a tower can be quite slow, especially for large values of n and m. It is important to make sure that your algorithm is as efficient as possible. A common mistake is to use a recursive algorithm, when a more efficient iterative algorithm is available.
5. **Memory errors.** The algorithm for computing the cumulative power of a tower can also be quite memory-intensive, especially for large values of n and m. It is important to make sure that your algorithm does not use too much memory. A common mistake is to allocate too much memory, or to forget to free memory that is no longer needed.

**Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:**

1. **Read the problem statement carefully and make sure you understand all the requirements.** If you are not sure about something, ask a question.
2. **Implement the algorithm carefully and test it thoroughly.** Use a debugger to check for errors in your code.
3. **Make sure your input and output are correct.** Use a test harness to verify that your program is reading and writing the input and output correctly.
4. **Optimize your algorithm for performance.** Use a profiling tool to identify the parts of your code that are slow.
5. **Manage your memory carefully.** Use a memory profiler to identify the parts of your code that are using too much memory.
Test inputs:
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 928_C. Dependency management

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly handling dependencies.** One common mistake is to incorrectly handle dependencies. For example, you might forget to add a dependency to a project, or you might add a dependency to a project that doesn't actually need it. This can lead to errors in your code, such as incorrect behavior or crashes.
2. **Using outdated dependencies.** Another common mistake is to use outdated dependencies. This can lead to security vulnerabilities and other problems. It's important to keep your dependencies up to date so that you can take advantage of the latest features and security fixes.
3. **Not using dependency management tools.** Using a dependency management tool can help you avoid many of the problems associated with dependencies. These tools can help you keep track of your dependencies, ensure that they are up to date, and resolve conflicts between dependencies.
4. **Not testing your code with different dependencies.** It's important to test your code with different dependencies to make sure that it works correctly with all of them. This will help you catch any problems that might arise when you use different dependencies in production.
5. **Not documenting your dependencies.** It's important to document your dependencies so that other developers can understand what your code depends on. This will help them to avoid problems when they try to use your code.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* **Use a dependency management tool.** A dependency management tool can help you keep track of your dependencies, ensure that they are up to date, and resolve conflicts between dependencies. Some popular dependency management tools include Maven, Gradle, and NPM.
* **Test your code with different dependencies.** It's important to test your code with different dependencies to make sure that it works correctly with all of them. This will help you catch any problems that might arise when you use different dependencies in production.
* **Document your dependencies.** It's important to document your dependencies so that other developers can understand what your code depends on. This will help them to avoid problems when they try to use your code.

HACKEREARTH a-game-for-soft-drinks

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input handling.** The input format specifies that there should be Q lines, each containing three space-separated integers. However, the code below does not check for this. If the input contains fewer than Q lines, or if any of the lines does not contain three space-separated integers, the code will not handle this correctly and may produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect output handling.** The output format specifies that the output should be a single line for each query, containing the winner of the game. However, the code below does not check for this. If the output contains more than one line, or if any of the lines does not contain the winner of the game, the code will not handle this correctly and may produce incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The code below does not correctly implement the rules of the game. For example, it does not correctly handle the case where all three piles are empty.
4. **Inefficient implementation.** The code below is inefficient because it uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible combinations of biscuits that Ashima could pick. This can be significantly improved by using a more efficient algorithm.
5. **Unclear code.** The code below is not very clear and easy to understand. This can make it difficult for other developers to understand and maintain the code.

Here are some suggestions for how to address these problems:

1. **To handle incorrect input,** the code could be modified to check for the following conditions:
    * That there are Q lines of input.
    * That each line of input contains three space-separated integers.
If any of these conditions are not met, the code could print an error message and exit.
2. **To handle incorrect output,** the code could be modified to check for the following conditions:
    * That the output contains exactly Q lines.
    * That each line of output contains the winner of the game.
If any of these conditions are not met, the code could print an error message and exit.
3. **To correct the logic,** the code could be modified to correctly implement the rules of the game. For example, it should correctly handle the case where all three piles are empty.
4. **To improve the efficiency,** the code could be modified to use a more efficient algorithm for iterating over all possible combinations of biscuits that Ashima could pick. For example, it could use a bitmask to represent the different combinations of biscuits.
5. **To improve the clarity of the code,** the code could be refactored to make it more readable and easy to understand. For example, it could use descriptive variable names and comments to explain the purpose of each block of code.

Title:
HACKEREARTH crack-the-code

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong type for variables.** The problem states that the input will be two integers, but the code below uses strings to store the input. This will cause errors when trying to perform mathematical operations on the input.

```
x, y = input().split()
```

**2. Not using the correct data type for calculations.** The problem states that the Fibonacci numbers will be integers, but the code below uses floats to store the Fibonacci numbers. This will cause errors when trying to compare the Fibonacci numbers to each other.

```
f1 = float(x)
f2 = float(y)
```

**3. Using the wrong formula for the Fibonacci numbers.** The Fibonacci numbers are defined as follows:

```
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
```

The code below uses the following formula:

```
F(n) = n + 1
```

This will result in incorrect Fibonacci numbers being generated.

```
def fibonacci(n):
  return n + 1
```

**4. Not checking for invalid input.** The problem states that the input will be two integers, but the code below does not check to make sure that the input is valid. This could cause errors if the user enters invalid input.

```
x, y = input().split()

if not x.isnumeric() or not y.isnumeric():
  raise ValueError("Input must be two integers")
```

**5. Not using the correct algorithm.** The problem states that the total Fibonacci numbers in the range [X, Y] must be even. The code below uses a brute-force algorithm to check this, which is inefficient. A more efficient algorithm would be to use a binary search.

```
def is_valid_code(x, y):
  count = 0
  for i in range(x, y + 1):
    if fibonacci(i) % 2 == 0:

Title:
HACKEREARTH fixing-of-file

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of `mkdir`**. The `mkdir` command creates a directory, but it does not create any of its parent directories. This can lead to problems if you try to create a directory that does not have a parent directory. For example, the following command will fail:

```
mkdir /home/gcj/finals
```

This is because the `/home/gcj` directory does not exist. To create the `/home/gcj/finals` directory, you would need to first create the `/home/gcj` directory.

2. **Incorrect use of `rmdir`**. The `rmdir` command removes a directory, but it does not remove any of its child directories. This can lead to problems if you try to remove a directory that has child directories. For example, the following command will fail:

```
rmdir /home/gcj/finals
```

This is because the `/home/gcj/finals` directory has the `/home/gcj/finals/file` file as a child directory. To remove the `/home/gcj/finals` directory, you would need to first remove the `/home/gcj/finals/file` file.

3. **Incorrect use of `cd`**. The `cd` command changes the current working directory. This can lead to problems if you try to change the current working directory to a directory that does not exist. For example, the following command will fail:

```
cd /home/gcj/finals
```

This is because the `/home/gcj/finals` directory does not exist. To change the current working directory to the `/home/gcj/finals` directory, you would need to first create the `/home/gcj/finals` directory.

4. **Incorrect use of `ls`**. The `ls` command lists the contents of a directory. This can lead to problems if you try to list the contents of a directory that does not exist. For example, the following command will fail:

```
ls /home/gcj/finals
```

This is because the `/home/gcj/finals` directory does not exist. To list the contents of the `/home/gcj/finals` directory, you would need to first create the `/home/gcj/finals` directory.

5. **Incorrect use of `grep`**. The `grep` command searches for a pattern in a file. This can lead to problems if you try to search for a pattern in a file that does not exist. For example, the following command will fail:

```
grep "hello world" /home/gcj/finals
```

This is because the `/home/gcj/finals` directory does not exist. To search for the pattern `"hello world"` in the `/home/gcj/finals` directory, you would need to first create the `/home/gcj/finals` directory.

HACKEREARTH jacks-dilemma

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable names:** The variable names `n`, `J`, and `L` are not very descriptive. It would be better to use names like `num_floors`, `jack_floor`, and `lift_floor`.
2. **Incorrect data type:** The variable `L` is declared as an integer, but it can actually be negative. This could lead to errors in the code. It would be better to declare `L` as a signed integer.
3. **Incorrect logic:** The code does not correctly handle the case where the lift is on the ground floor. In this case, the lift does not need to change directions, so the time to reach the ground floor should be `(n - j) * 5 + 10` instead of `(n - j) * 5 + 10 + 10`.
4. **Off-by-one error:** The code incorrectly calculates the time to reach the ground floor when the lift is on the top floor. In this case, the lift does not need to pick up Jack, so the time should be `(n - j) * 5 + 10` instead of `(n - j) * 5 + 10 + 10`.
5. **Unclear code:** The code is not very clear. It would be better to add comments to explain what each part of the code is doing.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def get_time_to_ground_floor(num_floors, jack_floor, lift_floor, lift_direction):
  """

Title:
HACKEREARTH micro-and-block-game-3

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input is a list of integers, but the code is expecting a list of strings. This can be fixed by using the `int()` function to convert each element of the list to an integer.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The code is iterating over the list of numbers one element too many. This can be fixed by starting the loop at `i=0` instead of `i=1`.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code is not taking into account the order of the numbers in the list. The maximum Fun Number is not always the number that is produced by concatenating the numbers from left to right. This can be fixed by sorting the list of numbers before concatenating them.
4. **Uncaught exception**. The code is not handling the case where the list of numbers is empty. This can be fixed by adding an `if` statement to check if the list is empty before trying to iterate over it.
5. **Inefficient algorithm**. The code is using a brute-force algorithm to find the maximum Fun Number. This algorithm is very inefficient for large lists of numbers. A more efficient algorithm would be to use a sorting algorithm to sort the list of numbers, and then to find the maximum Fun Number by iterating over the list of numbers in sorted order.

3. **Incorrect calculation:** The total number of tickets required is `n*(n+1)/2`, but the code is calculating `n+1`. This will cause the output to be incorrect.

To avoid these problems, make sure to:

1. Use the correct variable type for `n`.

Title:
HACKEREARTH softsort-7

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The algorithm given in the question is incorrect. For example, the code for sorting three numbers should be:

```
void print(int a, int b, int c) {
    printf(" %d %d %d\n", a, b, c);
}

void sort(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (a < b) {
        if (a < c) {
            if (b < c) {
                print(a, b, c);
            } else {
                print(a, c, b);
            }
        } else {
            print(c, a, b);
        }
    } else {
        if (b < c) {
            if (a < c) {
                print(b, a, c);
            } else {
                print(b, c, a);
            }
        } else {
            print(c, b, a);
        }
}
```

This code will not correctly sort the numbers in all cases. For example, if the input is `1`, `2`, and `3`, the output will be `1`, `3`, `2`, which is incorrect.

**2. Using incorrect data types**

The algorithm given in the question uses `int` data types for the numbers being sorted. However, this can lead to problems if the numbers are very large. For example, if the input is `1000000000`, the code will overflow and the output will be incorrect.

**3. Not using the correct modulo operator**

The algorithm given in the question uses the modulo operator `%` to calculate the length of the source code. However, this can lead to problems if the output is very large. For example, if the input is `1000000000`, the output will be `1000000000 % 10^9 + 7`, which is incorrect.

**4. Not using the correct variable names**

The algorithm given in the question uses variable names that are not descriptive. For example, the variable `a` is used to store the first number, the variable `b` is used to store the second number, and the variable `c` is used to store the third number. This can make it difficult to understand the code.

**5. Not using comments**

The algorithm given in the question does not use any comments. This can make it difficult to understand the code.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm**

The Bellman-Ford algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that can be used to find the shortest paths in a weighted graph. However, it is important to implement the algorithm correctly, as a bug in the implementation can lead to incorrect results.

One common mistake is to forget to initialize the distance array to infinity. This can lead to the algorithm returning incorrect results, as it will not be able to find the shortest paths.

Another common mistake is to not check for negative-weight cycles. If a graph contains a negative-weight cycle, the Bellman-Ford algorithm will enter an infinite loop. To avoid this, it is important to check for negative-weight cycles before running the algorithm.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm**

The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is a greedy algorithm that can be used to find the maximum flow in a flow network. However, it is important to implement the algorithm correctly, as a bug in the implementation can lead to incorrect results.

One common mistake is to forget to initialize the flow network to zero. This can lead to the algorithm returning incorrect results, as it will not be able to find the maximum flow.

Another common mistake is to not check for augmenting paths. If a flow network does not contain any augmenting paths, the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm will return zero as the maximum flow. To avoid this, it is important to check for augmenting paths before running the algorithm.

**3. Incorrect implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm**

The Dijkstra algorithm is a greedy algorithm that can be used to find the shortest paths in a weighted graph. However, it is important to implement the algorithm correctly, as a bug in the implementation can lead to incorrect results.

One common mistake is to forget to initialize the distance array to infinity. This can lead to the algorithm returning incorrect results, as it will not be able to find the shortest paths.

Another common mistake is to not use a priority queue to order the vertices. This can lead to the algorithm running inefficiently, as it will have to repeatedly sort the vertices.

**4. Incorrect implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm**

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that can be used to find the shortest paths in a weighted graph. However, it is important to implement the algorithm correctly, as a bug in the implementation can lead to incorrect results.

One common mistake is to forget to initialize the distance array to infinity. This can lead to the algorithm returning incorrect results, as it will not be able to find the shortest paths.

Another common mistake is to not use a nested loop to iterate over the vertices. This can lead to the algorithm running inefficiently, as it will have to repeatedly calculate the same distances.

**5. Incorrect implementation of the Prim's algorithm**

The Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that can be used to find a minimum spanning tree in a weighted graph. However, it is important to implement the algorithm correctly, as a bug in the implementation can lead to incorrect results.

One common mistake is to forget to initialize the distance array to infinity. This can lead to the algorithm returning incorrect results, as it will not be able to find the minimum spanning tree.

Another common mistake is to not use a priority queue to order the vertices. This can lead to the algorithm running inefficiently, as it will have to repeatedly sort the vertices.

ATCODER p02693 AtCoder Beginner Contest 165 - We Love Golf

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input specifies that all values are integers. However, if the developer accidentally uses a floating-point type, they may get incorrect results. For example, if the developer uses a float to represent the value of K, they may get an incorrect answer for the input `K = 7`, `A = 500`, and `B = 600`. This is because the float value of 500.00000000000003 is not a multiple of 7.

**2. Not checking for invalid input**

The input specifies that all values must be integers between 1 and 1000. However, if the developer does not check for invalid input, they may get incorrect results. For example, if the developer does not check for negative values, they may get an incorrect answer for the input `K = -1`, `A = 500`, and `B = 600`.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The developer may use incorrect logic to solve the problem. For example, they may incorrectly assume that the carry distance must be exactly divisible by K. This is not always the case. For example, if the developer uses the incorrect logic for the input `K = 7`, `A = 500`, and `B = 600`, they may get an incorrect answer of `NG`.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

The developer may not handle edge cases correctly. For example, they may not handle the case where K is equal to 1. In this case, the carry distance must be equal to A or B.

**5. Not using efficient algorithms**

The developer may not use efficient algorithms to solve the problem. For example, they may use a brute-force algorithm to check if the carry distance is a multiple of K. This can be very inefficient for large values of K.

**6. Not using appropriate data structures**

The developer may not use appropriate data structures to solve the problem. For example, they may use a list to store the possible carry distances. This can be very inefficient for large values of K.
Test inputs:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

Title:
ATCODER p02822 AtCoder Beginner Contest 149 - Surrounded Nodes

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the DFS traversal.** The DFS traversal should visit all the vertices in the tree, and the order of the vertices visited does not matter. However, if the implementation is incorrect, it may miss some vertices or visit them in the wrong order. This will lead to incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the expected holeyness.** The expected holeyness is the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes. The probability of each outcome can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of the individual events that make up the outcome. However, if the calculation is incorrect, the expected holeyness will be incorrect.

**3. Using an incorrect modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) is used to find the remainder of a division. When the answer is a rational number, we need to print it modulo 10^9+7. However, if the modulo operator is used incorrectly, the answer may be incorrect.

**4. Using an incorrect data type.** The input and output of the problem are given in the form of integers. However, if the data type is incorrect, the values may be misinterpreted. This can lead to incorrect results.

**5. Using an incorrect algorithm.** The problem can be solved using a variety of algorithms. However, if the algorithm is incorrect, the results will be incorrect.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the constraints. It is also important to carefully implement the solution and test it thoroughly.

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**

The input format is `N
p_1 p_2 ... p_N`. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to parse the input and will throw an error.

**2. The program does not check if the input is a permutation**

The problem statement states that `p` is a permutation of `{1, 2, ..., N}`. If the program does not check if the input is a permutation, it may output the wrong answer.

**3. The program does not check if the input is sorted**

The problem statement states that `p` is a permutation of `{1, 2, ..., N}`. If the input is sorted, the program will not be able to sort it in ascending order by swapping two elements.

**4. The program does not check if the input is solvable**

The problem statement states that the program can perform the following operation at most once: choose integers `i` and `j` (1 <= i < j <= N), and swap `p_i` and `p_j`. If the input is not solvable, the program will not be able to find a solution.

**5. The program does not output the correct answer**

The problem statement states that the program should print `YES` if the input can be sorted in ascending order by swapping two elements, and `NO` otherwise. If the program does not output the correct answer, it will not be able to solve the problem.

Title:
ATCODER p03094 AtCoder Grand Contest 032 - One Third

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The most common mistake when solving this problem is to implement the algorithm incorrectly. This could happen in a number of ways, such as:

* Using the wrong formula for the expected value.
* Making a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm.
* Not handling edge cases correctly.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the algorithm before implementing it. It is also helpful to test the algorithm on some small examples to make sure that it is correct.

**2. Using the wrong data type**

Another common mistake is to use the wrong data type. For example, if the expected value is a rational number, it is important to use a data type that can store rational numbers, such as `Decimal` or `fraction`.

Using the wrong data type could lead to incorrect results or errors. To avoid this mistake, it is important to choose the correct data type for the problem.

**3. Not handling edge cases correctly**

It is also important to handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the number of cuts is 1, then the expected value of `|x - 1/3|` is 0. However, if the number of cuts is 0, then the expected value of `|x - 1/3|` is undefined.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to carefully consider all of the possible edge cases and to handle them correctly.

**4. Not using the modulo operator correctly**

The problem statement specifies that the output should be modulo `10^9 + 7`. This means that any numbers that are greater than or equal to `10^9 + 7` should be reduced modulo `10^9 + 7`.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to remember to use the modulo operator when performing calculations.

**5. Not using the right programming language**

Finally, it is important to use the right programming language for the problem. Some programming languages are better suited for certain types of problems than others.

For example, if the problem requires a lot of mathematical calculations, it might be better to use a programming language that has a strong math library.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to choose the right programming language for the problem.

The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input contains a non-integer value, the program may not be able to parse it correctly.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The data type of the input values must be correct. For example, if the input contains a string value, the program may not be able to handle it correctly.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic of the program must be correct. For example, if the program does not correctly identify the center coordinates and height of the pyramid, the output will be incorrect.

ATCODER p03393 AtCoder Grand Contest 022 - Diverse Word

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly checking if a string is diverse.** A string is diverse if and only if it is a nonempty string of English lowercase letters and all letters in the word are distinct. For example, `atcoder`, `zscoder` and `agc` are diverse words while `gotou` and `connect` aren't diverse words. A common mistake is to check if a string is diverse by simply checking if it contains all 26 letters of the English alphabet. This is incorrect because a string can be diverse even if it doesn't contain all 26 letters. For example, the string `abc` is diverse even though it doesn't contain the letter `d`.
2. **Incorrectly finding the next word in the dictionary.** The next word in the dictionary is the lexicographically smallest diverse word that is lexicographically larger than the given word. A common mistake is to simply find the first word in the dictionary that is larger than the given word. This is incorrect because the next word in the dictionary may not be the first word that is larger than the given word. For example, if the given word is `abc`, the next word in the dictionary is `abcd`. However, the first word in the dictionary that is larger than `abc` is `bcde`.
3. **Incorrectly handling invalid input.** The input to this problem is a string of English lowercase letters. A common mistake is to not handle invalid input correctly. For example, if the input is not a string of English lowercase letters, the program should print an error message and exit.
4. **Incorrectly handling the case where the next word in the dictionary doesn't exist.** The next word in the dictionary may not exist if the given word is the last word in the dictionary. A common mistake is to assume that the next word in the dictionary always exists. For example, if the given word is `zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba`, the next word in the dictionary doesn't exist.
5. **Incorrectly implementing the algorithm.** The algorithm for finding the next word in the dictionary is relatively simple. However, it is important to implement the algorithm correctly. A common mistake is to make a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm. For example, a common mistake is to forget to check if the next word in the dictionary exists before printing it.

Title:
ATCODER p03556 AtCoder Beginner Contest 077 - Around Square

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect rounding**. When calculating the square root of a number, it is important to round the result to the nearest integer. For example, the square root of 10 is approximately 3.16227766, but we would round this to 3.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. When comparing two numbers, it is important to make sure that you are comparing the correct values. For example, if you are comparing the square roots of two numbers, you need to make sure that you are comparing the square roots of the same numbers, not the numbers themselves.
3. **Incorrect use of mathematical functions**. When using mathematical functions, it is important to make sure that you are using them correctly. For example, the `sqrt()` function returns the square root of a number, not the square of a number.
4. **Incorrect use of data types**. When storing numbers, it is important to use the correct data type. For example, if you are storing a number that is larger than 2^31-1, you need to use a 64-bit integer.
5. **Logic errors**. When writing code, it is important to make sure that your logic is correct. For example, if you are trying to find the largest square number not exceeding a given number, you need to make sure that you are not including the number itself in your search.

Title:
ATCODER p03867 AtCoder Regular Contest 064 - Rotated Palindromes

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect modular arithmetic**

When computing the answer modulo 10^9+7, it is important to make sure that all intermediate calculations are also performed modulo 10^9+7. For example, if you are computing ```a * b``` modulo 10^9+7, you must first compute ```a``` modulo 10^9+7 and ```b``` modulo 10^9+7, and then multiply the two results together modulo 10^9+7.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

When computing the number of possible sequences, it is important to make sure that you account for all possible cases. For example, if you are computing the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items, you must remember to include the case where k = 0.

**3. Incorrect use of mathematical identities**

When using mathematical identities to simplify expressions, it is important to make sure that you are using the identities correctly. For example, the identity ```(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2``` only holds when ```a``` and ```b``` are real numbers. If ```a``` or ```b``` is a complex number, the identity does not hold.

**4. Incorrect use of data structures**

When using data structures to store data, it is important to make sure that the data structures are used correctly. For example, if you are using a hash table to store a set of values, you must make sure that the values are unique. If two values are accidentally added to the hash table with the same key, the hash table will not be able to correctly store the values.

**5. Incorrect use of algorithms**

When using algorithms to solve problems, it is important to make sure that the algorithms are used correctly. For example, if you are using a sorting algorithm to sort a list of numbers, you must make sure that the list is actually sorted after the algorithm has finished running.

Title:
ATCODER p04031 AtCoder Beginner Contest 043 - Be Together

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a list of integers. If the developer uses the wrong data type, such as a string, the program will not be able to correctly process the data.

**2. Not handling negative numbers correctly**

The input data may contain negative numbers. If the developer does not handle negative numbers correctly, the program may produce incorrect results.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a variety of algorithms. If the developer uses an incorrect algorithm, the program may not be able to find the optimal solution.

**4. Not handling edge cases correctly**

The problem may have some edge cases that the developer needs to handle correctly. For example, what happens if the input data is empty? What happens if all of the integers in the input data are the same?

**5. Not testing the program thoroughly**

It is important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly. The developer should test the program with a variety of input data, including negative numbers, edge cases, and invalid data.

**6. Using insecure code**

The program should not contain any security vulnerabilities. For example, the program should not accept input from untrusted sources or store sensitive data in a insecure way.

Title:
AIZU p00115 Starship UAZ Advance

Pain points:
**1. Input data format**

The input data is in the following format:

```
UAZ Advance coordinates (x, y, z)
Enemy coordinates (x, y, z)
Barrier vertex 1 coordinates (x, y, z)
Barrier vertex 2 coordinates (x, y, z)
Barrier vertex 3 coordinates (x, y, z)
```

The coordinates are all integers and are separated by half-width spaces.

**2. Calculation of the intersection of a line and a plane**

To determine if the beam hits the barrier, we need to calculate the intersection of the beam with the plane of the barrier. The equation of a plane can be written as

```
ax + by + cz + d = 0
```

where `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are constants. The intersection of a line with a plane can be found by solving the following system of equations:

```
ax + by + cz + d = 0
x = x1 + t*u
y = y1 + t*v
z = z1 + t*w
```

where `(x1, y1, z1)` is a point on the line and `(u, v, w)` is the direction of the line.

**3. Determining if the enemy is in the barrier**

To determine if the enemy is in the barrier, we need to check if all of the enemy's coordinates are inside the barrier. The vertices of the barrier form a triangle, so we can check if the enemy is inside the triangle by using the following algorithm:

1. Draw a line from the enemy to each of the vertices of the barrier.
2. If any of the lines intersects the other two lines, then the enemy is inside the barrier.

**4. Handling floating-point errors**

When calculating the intersection of a line and a plane, it is important to handle floating-point errors. Floating-point numbers are not exact, so there is a chance that the calculated intersection point will not be exactly on the plane. To avoid this, we can use a tolerance value to determine if the intersection point is close enough to the plane.

**5. Debugging**

The most important part of debugging a program is to have a good understanding of the problem you are trying to solve. Once you have a good understanding of the problem, you can start debugging the program by using the following techniques:

* **Printing debugging statements**. This is the most basic debugging technique. By printing debugging statements, you can see the values of variables and the flow of the program.
* **Using a debugger**. A debugger allows you to step through the program one line at a time, which can help you to identify errors.
* **Using a unit test framework**. A unit test framework allows you to write tests that verify the correctness of your code. Unit tests can help you to identify errors early in the development process.

**6. Tips for writing efficient code**

When writing efficient code, it is important to keep the following tips in mind:

* **Use the right data structures**. The data structures you use can have a significant impact on the performance of your code. For example, using a hash table to store a collection of objects is more efficient than using a linked list.
* **Minimize the number of function calls**. Each function call incurs a performance penalty. So, if you can avoid making function calls, your code will be more efficient.
* **Use caching**. Caching can improve the performance of your code by storing the results of expensive calculations.
* **Optimize for the most common case**. When optimizing your code, it is important to focus on the most common case. This is because the most common case will account for the majority of the execution time.

Title:
AIZU p00248 Magic Square

Pain points:
## Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrectly counting the number of edges in the graph.** The problem statement states that a magic circle cannot be created on a two-dimensional plane if it contains a complete graph with 5 vertices or a complete bipartite graph with 3 or 3 vertices. To check for these conditions, we need to count the number of edges in the graph. A simple mistake that a developer might make is to count the number of edges incorrectly. For example, if the graph contains two vertices A and B that are connected by two edges, a developer might incorrectly count the number of edges as 1 instead of 2.
2. **Incorrectly checking for cycles in the graph.** The problem statement also states that a magic circle cannot be created on a two-dimensional plane if it contains a cycle. To check for this condition, we need to check if the graph contains any cycles. A simple mistake that a developer might make is to incorrectly check for cycles. For example, if the graph contains two vertices A and B that are connected by two edges, a developer might incorrectly conclude that the graph does not contain a cycle.
3. **Incorrectly checking for the existence of a Hamiltonian path in the graph.** The problem statement states that a magic circle can be drawn on a one-dimensional straight line if it contains a Hamiltonian path. To check for this condition, we need to check if the graph contains a Hamiltonian path. A simple mistake that a developer might make is to incorrectly check for the existence of a Hamiltonian path. For example, if the graph contains two vertices A and B that are connected by two edges, a developer might incorrectly conclude that the graph contains a Hamiltonian path.
4. **Incorrectly handling the case where the graph is disconnected.** The problem statement states that a magic circle can be drawn on a one-dimensional straight line if it contains a Hamiltonian path. However, it is possible for the graph to be disconnected, meaning that it does not contain any edges that connect two vertices that are not in the same component. In this case, the developer needs to handle the situation appropriately. For example, the developer could print "no" if the graph is disconnected.
5. **Incorrectly handling the case where the graph is not a simple graph.** The problem statement states that a magic circle can be drawn on a one-dimensional straight line if it contains a Hamiltonian path. However, it is possible for the graph to be a non-simple graph, meaning that it contains multiple edges that connect the same two vertices. In this case, the developer needs to handle the situation appropriately. For example, the developer could print "no" if the graph is not a simple graph.

** Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs **

1. **Incorrectly counting the number of chests in a section.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. Be sure to carefully count the number of chests in each section, including the section itself and its 8 neighbors.
2. **Using the wrong formula to calculate the minimum number of chests.** The minimum number of chests is equal to the sum of the numbers in all of the sections with digits, minus the number of sections with digits. Be sure to use the correct formula to avoid incorrect results.
3. **Misunderstanding the problem statement.** The problem statement states that "You may assume that there is at most one chest in each section." This means that you cannot place more than one chest in any section. If you do, your solution will be incorrect.
4. **Not handling invalid input correctly.** The input may contain invalid data, such as a map that is not square or a map that contains characters other than '.', '*', and digits. Be sure to handle invalid input gracefully so that your program does not crash.
5. **Not using efficient algorithms.** The problem can be solved in O(n^2) time, where n is the number of sections in the map. However, there are more efficient algorithms that can be used to solve the problem in O(n) time. Using an inefficient algorithm will result in a slower program.

**Additional Tips**

* Use a debugger to help you find and fix bugs in your code.
* Test your code on a variety of input data to make sure that it works correctly.
* Ask for help from a mentor or instructor if you are stuck.

2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is not in the correct data type. For example, the number of towns and the number of cycling roads are not integers.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program is incorrect. For example, the program does not check if the starting point and the goal point are the same.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correct. For example, the output is not in the format "Yes" or "No".
5. **Memory leak**. The program does not release the memory that it allocated. This can lead to a system crash.
6. **Security vulnerability**. The program does not properly check the input data. This can allow attackers to exploit the program.
7. **Performance issues**. The program is not efficient. This can lead to slow performance.

Title:
AIZU p01784 Parentheses

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of parentheses.** This is the most common error, and it can be caused by forgetting to close a parenthesis, using the wrong type of parenthesis, or nesting parentheses incorrectly.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When counting the number of open and closed parentheses, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one or add one too many. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect use of the stack data structure.** The stack is a data structure that is used to store data in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order. This means that the last item that is added to the stack is the first item that is removed. When using a stack to solve this problem, it is important to push and pop elements correctly in order to maintain the correct order of the parentheses.
4. **Incorrect use of the recursion function.** The recursion function is used to call itself repeatedly until the base case is reached. It is important to make sure that the base case is handled correctly, and that the function terminates after a finite number of calls.
5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that could be encountered when solving this problem, such as using the wrong data type, making a logical error, or not handling all possible input cases.

Title:
AIZU p01919 Country in Distortion

Pain points:
1. The input format is not well-defined. For example, it is not clear whether the first line should contain the number of vertices and edges, or the number of vertices and the number of edges separately.
2. The input format does not specify the order of the vertices and edges. This could lead to problems if the graph is not connected.
3. The input format does not specify the range of values for the vertices and edges. This could lead to problems if the values are too large or too small.
4. The output format is not well-defined. For example, it is not clear whether the output should be a single number or a list of numbers.
5. The problem statement does not specify the time complexity or space complexity of the solution. This could lead to problems if the solution is too slow or too memory-intensive.
6. The problem statement does not specify the correctness of the solution. This could lead to problems if the solution does not produce the correct output.
7. The problem statement does not specify the robustness of the solution. This could lead to problems if the solution fails to handle unexpected inputs.

Title:
AIZU p02057 MOD Rush

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input is a list of integers, but the code is expecting a list of strings.
2. **Incorrect variable name**. The variable `B` is used to store the list of integers, but the code is expecting the variable `A` to be used.
3. **Incorrect operator**. The code is using the `+` operator to add two integers, but the correct operator is `%`.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The code is adding the remainders of each element in the list, but the correct answer is the sum of the elements in the list.
5. **Incorrect output format**. The code is printing the answer on one line, but the correct output format is to print the answer on a new line.

Title:
AIZU p02199 Run

Pain points:
1. Incorrect variable type for input. The input should be of type `int`, but it is of type `str`.
2. Incorrect variable type for output. The output should be of type `float`, but it is of type `str`.
3. Incorrect operator for calculation. The operator `+` should be used for addition, but it is used for subtraction.
4. Incorrect comparison operator. The operator `>` should be used for greater than, but it is used for less than.
5. Incorrect variable initialization. The variable `A` is initialized with the value `14`, but it should be initialized with the value `1`.
6. Incorrect variable assignment. The variable `B` is assigned the value `86`, but it should be assigned the value `100`.
7. Incorrect calculation. The expression `A + B` should be evaluated to the value `90`, but it is evaluated to the value `100`.
8. Incorrect output. The output should be `90.0`, but it is `100.0`.

16 **1. Incorrectly implementing the segment tree.**

The segment tree is a powerful data structure that can be used to solve a variety of problems efficiently. However, it is important to implement the segment tree correctly in order to avoid bugs. One common mistake is to incorrectly implement the merge function. The merge function takes two segments and merges them into one larger segment. If the merge function is not implemented correctly, it can lead to incorrect results.

**2. Using the wrong data type for the segment tree.**

The segment tree is a binary tree, so the data type used to store the nodes of the tree must be able to represent a binary tree. A common mistake is to use an array to store the nodes of the tree. This is incorrect because an array cannot represent a binary tree.

**3. Not initializing the segment tree correctly.**

Before using the segment tree, it is important to initialize it correctly. This involves setting the values of all of the nodes in the tree to 0. If the segment tree is not initialized correctly, it can lead to incorrect results.

**4. Using the segment tree incorrectly.**

The segment tree is a powerful data structure, but it is important to use it correctly in order to avoid bugs. One common mistake is to use the segment tree to find the sum of a range of elements when the segment tree is only being used to maintain the minimum value of a range of elements. This can lead to incorrect results.

**5. Not handling edge cases correctly.**

When implementing the segment tree, it is important to handle edge cases correctly. One common edge case is when the range of elements to be updated or queried is empty. If this edge case is not handled correctly, it can lead to incorrect results.

**6. Using a segment tree that is too small.**

The size of the segment tree is important because it affects the performance of the segment tree. If the segment tree is too small, it can lead to a decrease in performance.

**7. Using a segment tree that is too large.**

The size of the segment tree is also important because it affects the memory usage of the segment tree. If the segment tree is too large, it can lead to an increase in memory usage.
