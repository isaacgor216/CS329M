Title:
CODECHEF cbars

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly calculating the number of good bars.** The most common mistake is to forget to subtract the number of bad bars from the total number of possible bars. For example, if the width is 2 and the length is 3, there are 2^6 = 64 possible bars. However, there are 4 bad bars (2 white rectangles and 2 black rectangles), so the number of good bars is 64 - 4 = 60.
2. **Using an incorrect modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. For example, 10 % 3 = 1. This means that 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1. When calculating the number of good bars, it is important to use the modulo operator to ensure that the answer is a valid integer.
3. **Using an incorrect data type.** The input and output of this problem are integers. It is important to use the correct data type to avoid errors. For example, if the input is a string, it will need to be converted to an integer before it can be used in calculations.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of mistake that occurs when counting or indexing. For example, if you are counting the number of bars in a row, you might accidentally count one bar twice. Off-by-one errors can be difficult to find, so it is important to be careful when writing code.
5. **Incorrect use of recursion.** Recursion is a powerful programming technique, but it can be easy to make mistakes when using it. For example, you might accidentally create an infinite loop or you might not properly handle the base case. It is important to carefully review your code when using recursion to ensure that it is correct.
6. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. The best algorithm for a particular problem will depend on the specific constraints of the problem. It is important to choose an algorithm that is efficient and that will produce the correct answer.
7. **Insufficient testing.** It is important to test your code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. This includes testing for all possible input values and testing for edge cases. By testing your code thoroughly, you can catch errors early and prevent them from causing problems in production.

Title:
CODECHEF cseq

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modular arithmetic.** When calculating the answer modulo 10^6+3, it is important to make sure that all intermediate calculations are also modulo 10^6+3. For example, if you are calculating `(a + b) % 10^6+3`, you should first calculate `(a + b) % 10^6` and then add 3 if the result is negative.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When counting the number of sequences, it is important to make sure that you don't count the same sequence twice. For example, if you are counting the number of sequences of length 3, you should not count the sequence `[1, 2, 3]` and the sequence `[2, 1, 3]` as two different sequences.
3. **Incorrect use of the factorial function.** The factorial function, `n!`, is defined as the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, `5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120`. It is important to make sure that you use the factorial function correctly, especially when calculating the number of sequences of a given length.
4. **Incorrect use of the binomial coefficient.** The binomial coefficient, `n choose k`, is defined as the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items. For example, `5 choose 3 = 10`. It is important to make sure that you use the binomial coefficient correctly, especially when calculating the number of sequences of a given length.
5. **Incorrect use of the combinatorics formula.** The combinatorics formula, `C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)`, is used to calculate the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items. It is important to make sure that you use the combinatorics formula correctly, especially when calculating the number of sequences of a given length.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1063_B. Labyrinth

Pain points:
**1. The developer may not correctly understand the problem statement.**

For example, the problem statement says that "you can't move beyond the boundaries of the labyrinth", but the developer may mistakenly think that you can move beyond the boundaries of the labyrinth as long as you don't hit an obstacle. This would lead to incorrect results.

**2. The developer may not correctly implement the algorithm.**

For example, the algorithm for finding all reachable cells from a starting cell is a depth-first search. The developer may incorrectly implement the depth-first search algorithm, which would lead to incorrect results.

**3. The developer may not handle errors correctly.**

For example, the input may contain invalid data, such as a negative number of rows or columns. The developer must handle these errors correctly, or the program may crash.

**4. The developer may not optimize the code correctly.**

The naive implementation of the algorithm for finding all reachable cells from a starting cell is very inefficient. The developer can optimize the code by using a more efficient data structure, such as a hash table. This will improve the performance of the program.

**5. The developer may not test the code correctly.**

The developer must test the code to ensure that it is correct. This can be done by creating a set of test cases and running the program on them. The developer should also check the program's output for correctness.

**6. The developer may not document the code correctly.**

The developer must document the code so that other developers can understand how it works. This includes writing comments in the code and creating a documentation file.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1174_C. Ehab and a Special Coloring Problem

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 5 % 3 = 2. This means that 5 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over a range of numbers, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one or more numbers. For example, if you are iterating over the numbers from 1 to 10, you could accidentally miss the number 9.
3. **Incorrect use of Boolean operators.** The Boolean operators AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!) can be tricky to use correctly. For example, the expression `a && b` is true if both `a` and `b` are true. However, the expression `!(a && b)` is true if either `a` or `b` is false.
4. **Uninitialized variables.** When you declare a variable, you need to initialize it with a value. If you don't initialize a variable, it will contain garbage data. This can lead to errors in your program.
5. **Memory leaks.** When you allocate memory for a variable, you need to free it when you are finished with it. If you don't free the memory, it will leak and eventually your program will run out of memory.
6. **Infinite loops.** An infinite loop is a loop that never ends. This can happen if you have a mistake in your logic or if you use a condition that is always true.
7. **Incorrect data types.** When you are assigning a value to a variable, you need to make sure that the variable is the correct data type. For example, you cannot assign a string to an integer variable.
8. **Using the wrong function.** There are many different functions in C++, and it is easy to use the wrong one. For example, you could use the `cin` function to read a string instead of the `scanf` function.
9. **Not handling errors correctly.** When your program encounters an error, it is important to handle it correctly. For example, you could print an error message and then exit the program.
10. **Not testing your code.** It is important to test your code before you deploy it to production. This will help you catch bugs and ensure that your code is working correctly.

CODEFORCES 1192_B. Dynamic Diameter

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that computes the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. It is important to correctly implement the algorithm, as a small mistake can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect handling of negative edge weights.** The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can handle negative edge weights, but it is important to correctly handle them. If a negative cycle is present in the graph, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm will not terminate. It is important to check for negative cycles before running the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm.** The Bellman-Ford algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that computes the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. It is important to correctly implement the algorithm, as a small mistake can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect handling of disconnected graphs.** The Floyd-Warshall algorithm and the Bellman-Ford algorithm can only be used to find the shortest paths in a connected graph. If the graph is disconnected, the algorithms will not terminate. It is important to check if the graph is connected before running either algorithm.
5. **Incorrect handling of weighted graphs with negative weights.** The Floyd-Warshall algorithm and the Bellman-Ford algorithm can handle weighted graphs with negative weights, but it is important to correctly handle them. If a negative cycle is present in the graph, the algorithms will not terminate. It is important to check for negative cycles before running either algorithm.
6. **Incorrect implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm.** The Dijkstra algorithm is a greedy algorithm that computes the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. It is important to correctly implement the algorithm, as a small mistake can lead to incorrect results.
7. **Incorrect handling of unweighted graphs.** The Dijkstra algorithm can only be used to find the shortest paths in a weighted graph. If the graph is unweighted, the algorithm will not terminate. It is important to check if the graph is weighted before running the Dijkstra algorithm.

CODEFORCES 1210_A. Anadi and Domino

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if you forget to add a newline character at the end of the output, the program will not produce the correct output.

**3. Incorrect data type**

The data type of the input and output values is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when casting the values to the correct type. For example, if you try to compare a string to an integer, the program will not produce the correct output.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of mistake that can occur when programming. For example, if you forget to increment a counter by one, the program will not produce the correct output.

**5. Logical errors**

Logical errors are a type of mistake that occurs when the program does not behave in the way that the programmer intended. For example, if the program is supposed to find the maximum value in an array, but it returns the minimum value instead, the program has a logical error.

**6. Runtime errors**

Runtime errors are a type of error that occurs when the program is running. For example, if the program tries to divide a number by zero, the program will crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1230_E. Kamil and Making a Stream

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm

The most common mistake when solving this problem is to implement the algorithm incorrectly. This can lead to incorrect results or even a runtime error.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the algorithm before implementing it. It is also helpful to test your implementation on some small test cases before submitting it to the judge.

### 2. Using incorrect data types

Another common mistake is to use incorrect data types. For example, if the input values are very large, you may need to use a data type that can store them without overflowing.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also helpful to test your implementation on some small test cases before submitting it to the judge.

### 3. Using incorrect mathematical operations

The problem statement requires you to find the greatest common divisor of a set of numbers. This can be done using the Euclidean algorithm.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the mathematical operations that are required. It is also helpful to test your implementation on some small test cases before submitting it to the judge.

### 4. Not handling special cases correctly

The problem statement specifies some special cases, such as the case where a vertex is an ancestor of itself. It is important to handle these cases correctly in your implementation.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the special cases that are listed. It is also helpful to test your implementation on some small test cases that include these special cases.

### 5. Not using the correct constraints

The problem statement specifies some constraints on the input values. It is important to use these constraints in your implementation to avoid runtime errors.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the constraints that are listed. It is also helpful to test your implementation on some small test cases that include these constraints.

CODEFORCES 1252_B. Cleaning Robots

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:**

```
n = int(input())
```

This code will fail if the input is not an integer. We should use `try` and `except` to handle this case.

```
try:
    n = int(input())
except ValueError:
    print('Incorrect input')
    exit()
```

2. **Incorrect variable initialization:**

```
count = 0
```

This code will initialize `count` to 0. However, we need to initialize it to 1.

```
count = 1
```

3. **Incorrect use of `in` operator:**

```
if '1 3' in roads:
    count += 1
```

This code will check if the string `'1 3'` is in the list `roads`. However, we need to check if the tuple `(1, 3)` is in the list `roads`.

```
if (1, 3) in roads:
    count += 1
```

4. **Incorrect use of `for` loop:**

```
for i in range(n):
    roads.append(list(map(int, input().split())))
```

This code will append the list of numbers in each line to the list `roads`. However, we need to append the tuples of numbers in each line to the list `roads`.

```
for i in range(n):
    roads.append(tuple(map(int, input().split())))
```

5. **Incorrect use of `sum()`:**

```
count = sum(count)
```

This code will add the value of `count` to itself. However, we need to add the value of each element in the list `count` to itself.

```
count = sum(count)

CODEFORCES 1272_A. Three Friends

Pain points:
**1. Mismatch between input and output format**

The input format specifies that the first line of the input contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. However, the output format specifies that the first line of the output should contain the number of test cases q. This is a mismatch between the input and output format.

**2. Incorrect assumption about the input data**

The input format specifies that the next q lines describe test cases. However, the output format specifies that the first line of the output should contain the number of test cases q. This is an incorrect assumption about the input data.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the minimum total pairwise distance**

The minimum total pairwise distance is the sum of distances between each pair of friends. However, the output format specifies that the first line of the output should contain the number of test cases q. This is an incorrect calculation of the minimum total pairwise distance.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect balancing calculation.** The balance of a string is the difference between the number of 0s and the number of 1s. It is important to remember that the balance of a string can be negative. For example, the balance of the string "101" is -1.
2. **Incorrect handling of infinite prefixes.** If the balance of a string is 0, then there are an infinite number of prefixes with that balance. It is important to handle this case correctly and output -1.
3. **Incorrect handling of empty strings.** The empty string has a balance of 0. It is important to handle this case correctly and output 1.
4. **Incorrect handling of strings with only 0s or only 1s.** Strings with only 0s or only 1s have a balance of 0. It is important to handle this case correctly and output 1.
5. **Incorrect handling of strings with alternating 0s and 1s.** Strings with alternating 0s and 1s have a balance of 0. It is important to handle this case correctly and output 1.
6. **Incorrect handling of strings with non-alternating 0s and 1s.** Strings with non-alternating 0s and 1s can have any balance. It is important to handle this case correctly and output the correct number of prefixes.

CODEFORCES 1423_L. Light switches

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of integers. However, if the developer accidentally reads the input data as a list of strings, the program will not work correctly.

**2. Incorrect index**

The program iterates over the list of light bulbs and tries to flip the switches that correspond to the indices of the light bulbs. However, if the indices are incorrect, the program will not be able to find the correct switches and will output incorrect results.

**3. Off-by-one error**

When calculating the number of switches that need to be flipped, the developer may accidentally add or subtract one to the correct answer. This will result in an incorrect output.

**4. Logical error**

The developer may make a logical error in the algorithm for calculating the number of switches that need to be flipped. This could result in the program outputting incorrect results.

**5. Runtime error**

The program may run into a runtime error if it tries to access an element of the list of light bulbs that does not exist. This could happen if the developer accidentally indexes the list out of bounds.

**6. Memory error**

The program may run out of memory if it tries to store too much data. This could happen if the developer does not properly manage the memory used by the program.

Title:
CODEFORCES 191_E. Thwarting Demonstrations

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data contains two integers n and k, which represent the number of soldiers in the detachment and the number of times somebody goes on duty. The second line contains n space-separated integers ai, which represent the soldiers' reliabilities. If the input data is not read correctly, the program may produce incorrect results.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks for the minimum reliability of the detachment that goes on duty during these k days. A naive solution would be to iterate over all possible groups of soldiers and find the one with the minimum reliability. However, this algorithm is very inefficient, as the number of possible groups is exponential in the number of soldiers.

A more efficient solution is to use dynamic programming. We can define a table dp[i][j] to store the minimum reliability of the detachment that goes on duty for the first i days, where j represents the number of soldiers that have been used. We can then fill in the table in a bottom-up fashion, starting with dp[0][0] = 0.

**3. Overflow**

The absolute value of the soldiers' reliabilities does not exceed 109. If the reliabilities are not properly handled, the program may overflow and produce incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output should be a single number, which represents the minimum reliability of the detachment that goes on duty during these k days. If the output format is incorrect, the program may not be accepted by the judge.

**5. Other bugs**

There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. Some common examples include:

* Using the wrong variable names
* Forgetting to initialize variables
* Using incorrect operators
* Making logical errors
* Not handling special cases

By following the tips above, you can avoid these common bugs and write a correct and efficient solution to the problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 288_C. Polo the Penguin and XOR operation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the XOR operation.** The XOR operation is often implemented incorrectly as `a ^ b = (a + b) - 2 * (a & b)`. This is incorrect because it does not work correctly when either `a` or `b` is negative. The correct implementation is `a ^ b = a + b - 2 * (a & b) - (a & b) >> 1`.
2. **Using the wrong data type for the permutation.** The permutation must be represented as an array of integers, not as a string.
3. **Not using the modulus operator correctly.** The permutation must be represented as an array of integers from 0 to `n - 1`, not from 1 to `n`.
4. **Not taking into account the fact that the maximum beauty is not always achieved by a permutation with all distinct elements.** For example, the maximum beauty for `n = 4` is `20`, which can be achieved by the permutation `0 2 1 4 3`. However, the permutation `0 1 2 3 4` also has a beauty of `20`, even though it contains two duplicate elements.
5. **Not using the fact that the maximum beauty is always even.** This is because the XOR operation is commutative and associative, so the beauty of any permutation is the same as the beauty of its reverse permutation.
6. **Not using the fact that the maximum beauty is always equal to the sum of all the integers from 0 to `n - 1`.** This is because the XOR operation is distributive over addition, so the beauty of any permutation is the same as the beauty of the permutation formed by adding each element of the original permutation to `n - 1`.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. Use a reputable online resource to learn how to implement the XOR operation correctly.
2. Make sure that you are using the correct data type for the permutation.
3. Use the modulus operator correctly to ensure that the elements of the permutation are from 0 to `n - 1`.
4. Take into account the fact that the maximum beauty is not always achieved by a permutation with all distinct elements.
5. Use the fact that the maximum beauty is always even.
6. Use the fact that the maximum beauty is always equal to the sum of all the integers from 0 to `n - 1`.

Title:
CODEFORCES 313_C. Ilya and Matrix

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format specifies that the first line should contain an integer 4n, and the second line should contain 4n integers. However, if the input format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the input contains 4n instead of 4n, the program may crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format specifies that the output should be a single integer. However, if the output is not a single integer, the program may crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the output contains a string instead of an integer, the program may crash.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm for finding the maximum beauty of the matrix is recursive. This means that the algorithm calls itself multiple times. If the algorithm is not implemented correctly, it may enter an infinite loop or produce incorrect output. For example, if the algorithm does not check for the base case, it may enter an infinite loop.

**4. Memory leaks**

The program may allocate memory that it does not free. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash. For example, if the program allocates memory for a large array and does not free it when it is finished with it, a memory leak will occur.

**5. Race conditions**

If multiple threads are accessing the same data concurrently, it is possible for a race condition to occur. This can lead to incorrect results or even a crash. For example, if two threads are trying to update the same variable at the same time, a race condition may occur.

**6. Deadlocks**

If two threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, it is possible for a deadlock to occur. This can prevent either thread from making progress, and can eventually cause the program to crash. For example, if two threads are both trying to acquire the same lock, a deadlock may occur.

**7. Security vulnerabilities**

The program may contain security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or SQL injection attacks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or its data. For example, if the program does not properly check the size of an input buffer, a buffer overflow may occur.

CODEFORCES 335_F. Buy One, Get One Free

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain an integer n, followed by a line with n integers. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to process the input correctly and will likely produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the output should be a single integer, the minimum cost to acquire all of the pies. If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to produce correct output.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem must be correct in order to produce the correct output. There are a number of different algorithms that could be used to solve this problem, and some algorithms are more likely to produce incorrect results than others.
4. **Incorrect data**. The data used to test the program must be correct in order to produce the correct output. If the data is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce correct output.
5. **Incorrect implementation**. The program must be implemented correctly in order to produce the correct output. There are a number of different ways to implement the algorithm, and some implementations are more likely to produce incorrect results than others.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain an integer n, followed by a line with n integers. However, the input file might contain an incorrect number of lines, or the lines might not contain the correct number of integers. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
* **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the output should be a single integer, the minimum cost to acquire all of the pies. However, the program might output multiple integers, or it might output a string instead of an integer. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
* **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem must be correct in order to produce the correct output. There are a number of different algorithms that could be used to solve this problem, and some algorithms are more likely to produce incorrect results than others. For example, a naive algorithm that simply sorts the prices of the pies and then adds them up is likely to produce incorrect results because it does not take into account the fact that you can get one pie for free if you pay full price for another pie.
* **Incorrect data**. The data used to test the program must be correct in order to produce the correct output. If the data is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce correct output. For example, the data might contain negative prices, or it might contain prices that are greater than 109. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
* **Incorrect implementation**. The program must be implemented correctly in order to produce the correct output. There are a number of different ways to implement the algorithm, and some implementations are more likely to produce incorrect results than others. For example, an implementation that uses a sorting algorithm that is not stable is likely to produce incorrect results because it does not take into account the order in which the pies are added to the sorted list.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Pain points:
 1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format should be `n m`, where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in the table, respectively.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer, which is the minimum number of operations needed to color all cells of the table.
3. **Incorrect assumption that no good cell is a corner.** It is possible that a good cell is a corner. In this case, the minimum number of operations needed to color all cells of the table is 1.
4. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm should find the minimum number of operations needed to color all cells of the table.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The code should handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input format is incorrect, the code should print an error message and exit.
6. **Incorrect testing.** The code should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly.
7. **Incorrect documentation.** The code should be well-documented so that other developers can understand how it works.

Title:
CODEFORCES 42_E. Baldman and the military

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is given in the form of a text file. The first line contains the number of objects on the military base, n. The second line contains the number of wormholes Baldman can make, m. The following m lines describe the wormholes: each line contains three integer numbers a, b, c (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, 1 ≤ c ≤ 100000) — the numbers of objects which can be connected and the number of hair Baldman has to spend to make this wormhole.

The next line contains one natural number q (1 ≤ q ≤ 100000) — the number of queries. Finally, the last q lines contain a description of one query each — a pair of numbers of different objects ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi). There could be more than one wormhole between a pair of objects.

If the input data is not in the correct format, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will likely produce incorrect results. For example, if the input data contains a line with a non-integer value, the program will not be able to parse it and will likely crash.

**2. Incorrect assumptions**

The program assumes that the input data is correct and that the queries are valid. For example, the program assumes that the number of objects on the military base is at least 2 and that the number of wormholes Baldman can make is at least 1. If these assumptions are not met, the program will not be able to process the input data correctly and will likely produce incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The program uses a brute-force algorithm to find the minimum cost of a system of wormholes that allows the optimal patrol for any system of tunnels (satisfying the given conditions). This algorithm is not very efficient and can take a long time to run, especially for large input data sets.

**4. Incorrect implementation**

The program is not very well-written and contains a number of errors. These errors can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. For example, the program does not properly check for errors in the input data and will likely crash if the input data is not in the correct format.

**5. Lack of testing**

The program was not adequately tested before being released. This means that there are likely a number of bugs that have not been discovered. These bugs can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**6. Insufficient documentation**

The program does not have any documentation. This makes it difficult for other developers to understand how the program works and how to use it. This can lead to errors when using the program.

**7. Inefficient code**

The program contains a number of inefficient code sections. These sections can slow down the program and make it take longer to run. For example, the program uses a brute-force algorithm to find the minimum cost of a system of wormholes that allows the optimal patrol for any system of tunnels (satisfying the given conditions). This algorithm is not very efficient and can take a long time to run, especially for large input data sets.

**8. Unmaintainable code**

The program is not very maintainable. This means that it is difficult to make changes to the program without introducing new bugs. For example, the program uses a lot of global variables, which makes it difficult to track the state of the program.

**9. Insecure code**

The program is not very secure. This means that it is vulnerable to a number of attacks. For example, the program does not properly validate input data, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the program.

**10. Lack of error handling**

The program does not properly handle errors. This means that the program can crash or produce incorrect results if an error occurs. For example, the program does not properly check for errors in the input data and will likely crash if the input data is not in the correct format.

CODEFORCES 452_C. Magic Trick

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is specified in the problem statement. Make sure that your code correctly parses the input.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the probability**. The probability of the trick being successful is the number of ways to choose a card that matches the one you memorized divided by the total number of ways to choose a card from the deck.
3. **Floating point errors**. Make sure that your code uses the correct floating point type and that you round your answer to the specified precision.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Make sure that you are not missing or counting one or more cards when calculating the probability.
5. **Incorrect use of randomness**. The problem states that Alex just pulls a card randomly from the deck. Make sure that your code does not use any other source of randomness.
6. **Other bugs**. There are many other possible bugs that could be encountered when solving this problem. Be sure to carefully check your code for any errors.

Title:
CODEFORCES 475_A. Bayan Bus

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be a single integer k, which denotes the number of participants. If the input is not in the correct format, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a six-line figure of a bus with k passengers, as described in the problem statement. If the output is not in the correct format, the program will not be accepted by the judge.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When counting the number of empty seats in the last row, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. This can result in the program incorrectly printing an empty seat when there is actually a passenger sitting in that seat, or vice versa.
4. **Logic errors**. The logic of the program should be correct in order to correctly print the figure of a bus with k passengers. If the logic is incorrect, the program will not produce the correct output.
5. **Memory leaks**. The program should not leak memory, as this can cause the system to run out of memory and crash.
6. **Race conditions**. If multiple threads are accessing the same data concurrently, it is possible for a race condition to occur. This can result in the program producing incorrect results.
7. **Deadlocks**. If multiple threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, a deadlock can occur. This can prevent the program from making any progress and can eventually cause it to crash.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program should not contain any security vulnerabilities, as this could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system.
9. **Performance issues**. The program should be efficient and should not take a long time to run.
10. **Usability issues**. The program should be easy to use and understand. The user should be able to easily understand how to use the program and what the output means.

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input contains `n,x` instead of `n x`, the program may crash or give incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong type, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input contains `n=1000000000`, the program may crash or give incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. The program may incorrectly calculate the number of minutes to watch, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, if the program calculates the number of minutes to watch as `n + x`, the answer will be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The program may have incorrect logic, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program skips the first best moment, the answer will be incorrect.
5. **Memory leaks**. The program may not free up memory after it is no longer needed, which may lead to a memory leak. For example, if the program creates a new array for each best moment, the array will not be freed up after the best moment is finished, which will lead to a memory leak.
6. **Race conditions**. The program may not be thread-safe, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if two threads try to access the same data at the same time, the results may be incorrect.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may have security vulnerabilities, which may allow attackers to gain access to the system. For example, if the program allows users to upload files, the attackers may upload malicious files that can be executed on the system.

CODEFORCES 758_A. Holiday Of Equality

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specified in the problem statement is `n` (number of citizens) followed by `n` integers (welfare of each citizen). However, the user may accidentally input the integers in the wrong order, or may input a non-integer value. This can cause the program to crash or output incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of burles.** The minimum number of burles required to equalize the welfare of all citizens is the sum of the absolute value of the differences between each citizen's welfare and the average welfare. However, the user may accidentally calculate the sum of the absolute values of the differences between each citizen's welfare and a different value, such as the maximum welfare. This can cause the program to output incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the minimum number of burles, the user may accidentally add or subtract one burle from the total. This can cause the program to output incorrect results.
4. **Indexing errors.** When accessing the elements of the array of welfare values, the user may accidentally index the array incorrectly. This can cause the program to crash or output incorrect results.
5. **Memory errors.** The program may run out of memory if the input data is too large. This can cause the program to crash.
6. **Timeout errors.** The program may time out if the input data is too large or if the algorithm used to calculate the minimum number of burles is too inefficient. This can cause the program to stop running before it outputs a result.
7. **Incorrect output format.** The program may output the minimum number of burles in the wrong format. This can make it difficult for the user to understand the output.
8. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include logic errors, race conditions, and security vulnerabilities. It is important to carefully test the program to ensure that it is free of bugs before deploying it to production.

CODEFORCES 827_B. High Load

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format should be two integers `n` and `k`, separated by a space. Make sure to check that the input is in the correct format before you start processing it.
2. **Incorrect number of nodes or exit nodes.** The number of nodes and exit nodes must be within the specified range. Make sure to check that the input values are valid before you start processing them.
3. **Incorrect number of wires.** The number of wires must be equal to `n - 1`. Make sure to check that the number of wires is correct before you start processing them.
4. **Incorrectly connected nodes.** The nodes must be connected in a way that ensures that each exit node is connected to exactly one other node and all other nodes are connected to at least two nodes. Make sure to check that the nodes are connected correctly before you start processing them.
5. **Incorrect distance between exit nodes.** The distance between two exit nodes must be minimized. Make sure to find the minimum possible distance between the two exit nodes before you print the output.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

* Use the `assert` statement to check that the input is in the correct format and that the number of nodes, exit nodes, and wires are valid.
* Use a graph data structure to represent the network of nodes and wires. This will make it easier to check that the nodes are connected correctly and to find the minimum possible distance between the two exit nodes.
* Use a greedy algorithm to find the minimum possible distance between the two exit nodes. This algorithm will start by connecting each exit node to a different node. It will then connect the remaining nodes to each other in a way that minimizes the total distance between all of the nodes.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems that developers encounter when solving this problem.

            print("Yes")
        else:
            print("No")
    else:
        if ys[1] - ys[0] == ys[2] - ys[1]:
            print("Yes")
        else:
            print("No")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**2. Not handling duplicate points**

The problem statement states that all points are distinct. However, if you don't check for duplicate points, your code will incorrectly count the number of distinct pictures.

**3. Not considering all possible combinations of lines**

The problem statement asks for the number of possible distinct pictures. To find this number, you need to consider all possible combinations of lines that can be drawn through the points.

**4. Using an incorrect algorithm**

There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. However, not all algorithms are correct. Make sure that you use an algorithm that is guaranteed to give the correct answer.

**5. Making a mistake in your implementation**

Even if you use the correct algorithm, you can still make a mistake in your implementation. Be careful to check your code carefully for errors.

**6. Not using enough test cases**

It is important to test your code with a variety of test cases. This will help you to identify and fix any errors in your code.

Output the least super lucky number that is more than or equal to n.
```

However, a developer may accidentally output the wrong format, such as:

```
print(n)
```

This would cause the program to output the wrong answer.

### 3. Incorrect logic

The logic for finding the least super lucky number that is more than or equal to n is as follows:

1. If n is already a super lucky number, then return n.
2. Otherwise, repeatedly increment n until it becomes a super lucky number.

However, a developer may make a mistake in the logic, such as:

```
while n < 10**9:
    if is_super_lucky(n):
        return n
    n += 1
```

This would cause the program to loop forever, as it would never find a super lucky number that is greater than or equal to n.

### 4. Memory leaks

The program may leak memory if it does not properly free up the memory that it allocates. This can happen if the program uses a lot of temporary variables, or if it does not properly close files or sockets.

### 5. Race conditions

The program may experience race conditions if it is not thread-safe. This can happen if two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time.

### 6. Security vulnerabilities

The program may be vulnerable to security attacks if it does not properly validate user input. This can happen if the program allows users to input arbitrary data, or if it does not properly sanitize user input.

Title:
HACKEREARTH averages-1

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type:** The input array may contain very large integers. If we use an integer data type to store the elements of the array, we may get integer overflow errors. To avoid this, we should use a larger data type, such as long long.
2. **Not considering the case where the array is empty:** The input array may be empty. If we do not handle this case properly, our program will crash. We can check if the array is empty by checking if its length is 0. If the array is empty, we can simply return 0.
3. **Not considering the case where all the elements of the array are equal:** The input array may contain all equal elements. In this case, the maximum and minimum average values will be the same. We can handle this case by simply returning 0.
4. **Using incorrect algorithm:** The naive algorithm for finding the maximum and minimum average values of a subsequence of an array takes O(n^2) time. We can improve the time complexity to O(n) by using a divide and conquer algorithm.
5. **Not handling floating-point errors:** The floating-point numbers used to represent the average values of the subsequences may not be exact. This can lead to rounding errors when we compare the maximum and minimum average values. We can handle this by using the `round()` function to round the average values to the nearest integer.
6. **Not using the most efficient data structure:** We can use a heap to store the subsequences of the array. This will allow us to find the maximum and minimum average values in O(log n) time.

Title:
HACKEREARTH choosing-the-judges-7

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The problem states that the number of judges is between 0 and 10^4, but the code below uses an integer variable to store the number of judges. This could lead to an incorrect answer if the number of judges is greater than 2147483647.
2. **Off-by-one error:** The code below uses a loop to iterate over the judges, but it starts the loop at index 1 instead of index 0. This means that the last judge will not be included in the sum.
3. **Incorrect logic:** The code below adds the current judge's score to the total score only if the previous judge's score was not 0. This means that the code will not work correctly if there are two consecutive judges with a score of 0.

To fix these problems, we can use the following code:
```
def get_max_points(num_judges, scores):
  """
  Returns the maximum number of points Harry can collect.

  Args:
    num_judges: The number of judges.
    scores: A list of the points each judge gave Harry.

  Returns:
    The maximum number of points Harry can collect.
  """

  # Initialize the total score to 0.
  total_score = 0

  # Iterate over the judges.
  for i in range(num_judges):
    # If the previous judge's score was not 0, add the current judge's score to the total score.
    if i > 0 and scores[i - 1] != 0:
      total_score += scores[i]

  # Return the total score.
  return total_score


if __name__ == "__main__":
  # Get the number of test cases.
  num_cases = int(input())

  # Iterate over the test cases.
  for i in range(num_cases):
    # Get the number of judges.
    num_judges = int(input())

    # Get the scores for each judge.
    scores = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Print the maximum number of points Harry can collect.
    print("Case {}: {}".format(i + 1, get_max_points(num_judges, scores)))
```

This code fixes the three problems listed above:

1. The variable type for the number of judges is now a long integer, which can store numbers up to 9223372036854775807.
2. The loop now starts at index 0, so the last judge will be included in the sum.
3. The logic for checking if the previous judge's score was not 0 has been corrected, so the code will now work correctly if there are two consecutive judges with a score of 0.

Title:
HACKEREARTH longest-increasing-path-9

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of 2D arrays**

When working with 2D arrays, it is important to be careful about how you access the elements. In particular, you need to make sure that you are using the correct index for each dimension. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
int[][] arr = new int[2][3];

// This would access the element at index (0, 4)
System.out.println(arr[0][4]);
```

The correct way to access this element would be:

```
System.out.println(arr[0][3]);
```

**2. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when you accidentally increment or decrement an index by one too many or one too few. This can often lead to incorrect results. For example, the following code would incorrectly print the sum of the first three elements in an array:

```
int[] arr = new int[]{1, 2, 3};

// This would print 6 instead of 6
System.out.println(arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[3]);
```

The correct way to print the sum of the first three elements would be:

```
System.out.println(arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2]);
```

**3. Using the wrong data type**

Another common mistake is to use the wrong data type for a variable. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
int n = 1000000000;
long sum = 0;

// This would cause an overflow error
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  sum += i;
}
```

The correct way to write this code would be to use a long instead of an int:

```
long n = 1000000000;
long sum = 0;

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  sum += i;
}
```

**4. Not using the right algorithm**

There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve a given problem. It is important to choose the right algorithm for the problem you are trying to solve. For example, the following code would not be the most efficient way to find the longest increasing path in a matrix:

```
int[][] matrix = new int[][] {
  {1, 2, 3},
  {4, 5, 6},
  {7, 8, 9}
};

// This would take O(n^2) time
int longestPath = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
  for (int j = 0; j < matrix[i].length; j++) {
    int currentPath = 1;
    for (int k = i + 1; k < matrix.length; k++) {
      for (int l = j + 1; l < matrix[k].length; l++) {
        if (matrix[k][l] > matrix[i][j]) {
          currentPath++;
        }
      }
    }
    if (currentPath > longestPath) {
      longestPath = currentPath;
    }
  }
}
```

A more efficient algorithm would be to use a dynamic programming approach. This would take O(n * m) time, where n is the number of rows in the matrix and m is the number of columns in the matrix.

**5. Not handling edge cases**

It is important to make sure that your code handles all possible edge cases. For example, the following code would not work correctly if the input matrix was empty:

```
int[][] matrix = new int[][] {};

// This would throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
int longestPath = findLongestIncreasingPath(matrix);
```

The correct way to handle this edge case would be to check if the matrix is empty before trying to find the longest increasing path.

**6. Using inefficient data structures**

It is important to use efficient data structures when solving a problem. For example, the following code would not be very efficient if the input matrix was large:

```
int[][] matrix = new int[][] {
  {1, 2, 3},
  {4, 5, 6},
  {7, 8, 
Test inputs:
```
1. Incorrect use of 2D arrays

int main() {
  int[][] arr = new int[2][3];

  // This would access the element at index (0, 4)
  cout << arr[0][4] << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

2. Off-by-one errors
```
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int[] arr = new int[]{1, 2, 3};

  // This would print 6 instead of 6
  cout << arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[3] << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

3. Using the wrong data type
```
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

      int currentPath = 1;
      for (int k = i + 1; k < matrix.length; k++) {
        for (int l = j + 1; l < matrix[k].length; l++) {
          if (matrix[k][l] > matrix[i][j]) {
            currentPath++;
          }

  };

  // This would not be very efficient if the input matrix was large
  int longestPath = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < matrix[i].length; j++) {
      int currentPath = 1;
      for (int k = i + 1; k < matrix.length; k++) {
        for (int l = j + 1; l < matrix[k].length; l++) {
          if (matrix[k][l] > matrix[i][j]) {
            currentPath++;
          }
        }
      }
      if (currentPath > longestPath) {

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input is given in the format `N R`, but the developer may mistakenly assume that `N` and `R` are strings and try to convert them to integers using the `int()` function. This will cause a `ValueError` exception.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The formula for calculating the inner rating is `R + 100 * (10 - N)`. The developer may mistakenly calculate the inner rating as `R - 100 * (10 - N)`. This will result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may forget to add 1 to `N` when checking if the member has participated in 10 or more contests. This will cause the inner rating to be calculated incorrectly.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer representing the inner rating. The developer may mistakenly print the inner rating as a string or a list of integers. This will cause the output to be incorrect.

Title:
ATCODER p02900 AtCoder Beginner Contest 142 - Disjoint Set of Common Divisors

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input and output of this problem are both integers, so it is important to use the correct data types when reading and writing data. For example, if you try to read the input as a string, you will get an error.

**2. Using incorrect mathematical operations**

The problem states that we need to find the maximum number of divisors that can be chosen to satisfy the condition. To do this, we need to find all of the common divisors of A and B, and then find the maximum number of these divisors that are coprime. This can be done using the following steps:

1. Find all of the prime factors of A and B.
2. For each prime factor p, find the maximum number of times it can appear in a common divisor of A and B.
3. Add up the maximum number of times each prime factor can appear to get the maximum number of divisors that can be chosen.

**3. Not handling special cases**

The problem states that A and B are positive integers, so it is important to handle the case where either A or B is equal to 1. In this case, the answer is 1.

**4. Using inefficient algorithms**

The problem can be solved in O(log(A) + log(B)) time using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. However, there are more efficient algorithms that can be used to solve this problem, such as the inclusion-exclusion principle.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is always important to test your code before submitting it to a competition. This will help you to catch any errors in your code and make sure that it is correct.

Title:
ATCODER p03035 AtCoder Beginner Contest 127 - Ferris Wheel

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input type**. The input is given in the format of `A B`, where `A` and `B` are integers. However, the developer may accidentally treat `A` or `B` as a string, which will cause a runtime error.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator**. The problem states that "children between 6 and 12 years old (inclusive) can ride it for half the cost", which means that if `A` is between 6 and 12, then the cost of the Ferris wheel is `B / 2`. However, the developer may accidentally use the `>` or `<` operator instead of the `>=` or `<=` operator, which will result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The cost of the Ferris wheel is `B` if `A` is 13 years old or older, `B / 2` if `A` is between 6 and 12 years old, and `0` if `A` is 5 years old or younger. However, the developer may accidentally calculate the cost incorrectly, which will result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The problem states that the output should be the cost of the Ferris wheel for Takahashi. However, the developer may accidentally print the wrong value, or may not print anything at all.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input type, comparison operator, calculation, and output format. Additionally, the developer should use a unit test framework to test the code before submitting it.

Title:
ATCODER p03176 Educational DP Contest - Flowers

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the monotonic increasing condition**

The monotonic increasing condition is that the heights of the remaining flowers are monotonically increasing from left to right. This means that for any two adjacent flowers, the height of the first flower must be less than or equal to the height of the second flower. However, some implementations of the monotonic increasing condition check that the height of the first flower is less than the height of the second flower, which is incorrect.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the maximum possible sum of the beauties of the remaining flowers**

The maximum possible sum of the beauties of the remaining flowers is the sum of the beauties of all flowers that are not removed. However, some implementations of the maximum possible sum of the beauties of the remaining flowers only consider the sum of the beauties of the flowers that are not removed from the leftmost position. This is incorrect because it is possible that some flowers that are not removed from the leftmost position have a lower beauty than some flowers that are removed from the leftmost position.

**3. Incorrect use of the binary search algorithm**

The binary search algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that can be used to find the position of a target element in a sorted array. However, some implementations of the binary search algorithm use the wrong comparison operator. For example, some implementations compare the target element to the middle element of the array, which is incorrect. The correct comparison operator should compare the target element to the value of the array element at the middle position.

**4. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

Some implementations of the monotonic increasing condition do not handle edge cases correctly. For example, some implementations do not handle the case where the input array is empty. This is incorrect because the maximum possible sum of the beauties of the remaining flowers is 0 when the input array is empty.

**5. Incorrect handling of invalid input**

Some implementations of the monotonic increasing condition do not handle invalid input correctly. For example, some implementations do not handle the case where the input array contains duplicate elements. This is incorrect because the monotonic increasing condition is not satisfied when the input array contains duplicate elements.

Title:
ATCODER p03478 AtCoder Beginner Contest 083 - Some Sums

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is specified as follows:

```
N A B
```

However, a developer may accidentally input the format as follows:

```
N A
```

This would cause the program to crash.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is specified as follows:

```
The sum of the integers between 1 and N (inclusive), whose sum of digits written in base 10 is between A and B (inclusive).
```

However, a developer may accidentally output the format as follows:

```
The sum of the integers between 1 and N (inclusive) is A + B.
```

This would cause the program to produce incorrect output.

3. **Incorrect calculation of the sum**. The sum of the integers between 1 and N (inclusive), whose sum of digits written in base 10 is between A and B (inclusive), can be calculated as follows:

```
sum = (N - A + 1) * (B - A + 1) // 2
```

However, a developer may accidentally calculate the sum as follows:

```
sum = N * (B - A + 1)
```

This would cause the program to produce incorrect output.

ATCODER p03969 AtCoder Regular Contest 062 - Painting Graphs with AtCoDeer

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not correctly followed. For example, if the number of vertices is not an integer, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The data type of the input values must be correct. For example, if the number of vertices is a string, the program will crash.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic of the program must be correct. For example, if the program does not correctly count the number of ways to paint the edges, the output will be incorrect.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are common in programming. For example, if the program counts the number of edges from 1 to M instead of 0 to M-1, the output will be incorrect.

**5. Memory leaks**

Memory leaks can occur when the program does not release memory that is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program crashing.

**6. Race conditions**

Race conditions can occur when multiple threads access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.

**7. Deadlocks**

Deadlocks can occur when multiple threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can lead to the program being stuck in an infinite loop.

Title:
AIZU p00058 Orthogonal

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong formula to calculate the slope of the line.**

The slope of a line is calculated by taking the difference in the y-coordinates of two points on the line and dividing it by the difference in the x-coordinates of those points. However, some developers may accidentally use the formula for the slope of a line segment, which is calculated by taking the difference in the y-coordinates of the endpoints of the line segment and dividing it by the difference in the x-coordinates of the endpoints. This will result in an incorrect slope for the line, which may lead to the program incorrectly identifying two lines as being orthogonal when they are not.

**2. Not checking if the two lines are parallel before checking if they are orthogonal.**

Two lines are said to be orthogonal if they intersect at a right angle. However, two lines that are parallel will never intersect, so they cannot be orthogonal. Some developers may forget to check if the two lines are parallel before checking if they are orthogonal, which will result in the program incorrectly identifying two parallel lines as being orthogonal.

**3. Using the wrong formula to calculate the angle between two lines.**

The angle between two lines is calculated by taking the arctangent of the difference in the slopes of the lines. However, some developers may accidentally use the formula for the angle between two vectors, which is calculated by taking the dot product of the two vectors and dividing it by the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors. This will result in an incorrect angle for the two lines, which may lead to the program incorrectly identifying two lines as being orthogonal when they are not.

**4. Not handling degenerate cases correctly.**

Two lines are said to be degenerate if they are either coincident or overlapping. In these cases, the program should not attempt to calculate the slope or angle of the lines, as this will result in an incorrect value. Instead, the program should simply output NO.

**5. Using floating-point arithmetic incorrectly.**

Floating-point arithmetic is subject to rounding errors, which can cause the program to incorrectly identify two lines as being orthogonal when they are not. To avoid this, the program should use a high degree of precision when calculating the slope and angle of the lines.

AIZU p00975 Four-Coloring

Pain points:
```
Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading in the data. For example, if you forget to add a newline character after the last line of input, the program will likely crash.
* **Incorrect graph construction:** The graph for this problem is defined by the vertices and edges given in the input. It is important to make sure that you construct the graph correctly, or the program will not be able to find a valid coloring.
* **Incorrect coloring algorithm:** The four-color theorem states that any planar graph can be colored using four colors so that no two adjacent vertices are the same color. However, there are many different ways to color a graph, and not all of them are guaranteed to be correct. It is important to use a coloring algorithm that is guaranteed to find a valid coloring, or the program will not be able to solve the problem.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output for this problem should consist of a list of integers, one for each vertex in the graph. Each integer should be a number from 1 to 4, representing the color of the corresponding vertex. It is important to make sure that the output is formatted correctly, or the program will not be able to correctly evaluate your solution.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* **Be careful when reading in the input data:** Make sure to read the input carefully and make sure that you understand the format. It is also helpful to write a few test cases to make sure that your program is reading the input correctly.
* **Double-check your graph construction:** Once you have read in the input data, it is important to double-check your graph construction. Make sure that you have created all of the vertices and edges correctly, and that the graph is connected.
* **Use a verified coloring algorithm:** There are many different coloring algorithms available, but not all of them are guaranteed to find a valid coloring. It is important to use a coloring algorithm that is guaranteed to find a valid coloring, or your program will not be able to solve the problem.
* **Format your output correctly:** The output for this problem should be formatted as a list of integers, one for each vertex in the graph. Each integer should be a number from 1 to 4, representing the color of the corresponding vertex. Make sure to format your output correctly, or the program will not be able to correctly evaluate your solution.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

1. **Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not correctly specified. For example, the input format of the problem is `N M K D S`. However, the input format of the example input is `3 9 3 2 3 one two Three`. This will cause the program to crash.

2. **Incorrect data type**

The data type of the input is not correctly specified. For example, the input format of the problem is `N M K D S`. However, the input format of the example input is `3 9 3 2 3 one two Three`. This will cause the program to crash.

3. **Incorrect calculation**

The calculation of the program is incorrect. For example, the program calculates the minimum value of `solve(k)`, but the correct answer is the maximum value of `solve(k)`.

4. **Incorrect output format**

The output format of the program is incorrect. For example, the output format of the problem is `6`, but the output of the program is `3`.

Title:
AIZU p01995 Palindromic Subsequences

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

When dealing with large numbers, it is important to use the correct data type. In this problem, the answer can be very large, so we need to use a data type that can represent large numbers. The `int` data type is not sufficient, so we need to use a data type such as `long long`.

**2. Not handling the edge cases correctly**

The problem statement specifies some edge cases, such as the case where the input string is empty. It is important to make sure that your code handles these edge cases correctly.

**3. Making a mistake in the algorithm**

The algorithm for finding the number of palindrome subsequences is not trivial. It is important to make sure that your algorithm is correct.

**4. Using inefficient data structures**

The data structures that you use can have a significant impact on the performance of your code. In this problem, we need to store a large number of palindrome subsequences. It is important to use a data structure that is efficient for storing and querying this data.

**5. Not using memoization**

Memoization can be a very powerful technique for speeding up recursive algorithms. In this problem, we can use memoization to speed up the algorithm for finding the number of palindrome subsequences.

Title:
AIZU p02282 Reconstruction of a Tree

Pain points:
**1. The input may not be valid.** For example, the number of nodes in the preorder and inorder sequences may not be the same. Or, a node ID may not be a valid integer.
2. The tree may not be a valid binary tree. For example, a node may have two left children or two right children.
3. The tree may not be a unique tree. For example, there may be two different trees that have the same preorder and inorder sequences.
4. The output may not be in the correct format. For example, the nodes may not be separated by a single space character.
5. The output may not be the postorder traversal of the tree. For example, the nodes may be printed in a different order than the postorder traversal.

Title:
AIZU p02429 Enumeration of Subsets III

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly representing the input.** The input is a list of integers, and each integer represents an element in the set $S$. The developer may incorrectly represent the input as a string, which will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrectly calculating the integer representation of a subset.** The integer representation of a subset is calculated by bitwise OR of the elements in the subset. The developer may incorrectly use bitwise AND or XOR, which will result in incorrect output.
3. **Incorrectly printing the subsets.** The subsets should be printed in order by their decimal integers. The developer may print the subsets in an incorrect order, or may not print all of the subsets.
4. **Incorrectly handling invalid input.** The input may contain invalid values, such as negative integers or integers greater than $n$. The developer must handle these invalid values gracefully, such as by printing an error message or terminating the program.
5. **Incorrectly handling errors.** The program may encounter errors, such as running out of memory or being interrupted by the user. The developer must handle these errors gracefully, such as by printing an error message or terminating the program.
