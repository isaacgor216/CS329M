CODECHEF cntsols

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modular arithmetic**. One common mistake is to forget to perform modular arithmetic when computing intermediate values. For example, if you are computing ```(a + b) % c```, you need to first compute ```a + b``` and then perform the modulo operation.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. Another common mistake is to make an off-by-one error when computing the number of solutions to an equation. For example, if you are asked to find the number of solutions to ```x^2 = 4``` in the range ```[0, 10]```, you might incorrectly count the solution ```x = 4``` twice.
3. **Incorrect use of mathematical functions**. Another common mistake is to incorrectly use mathematical functions. For example, if you are asked to compute ```log(x)```, you need to make sure that ```x > 0```.
4. **Incorrect use of data structures**. Another common mistake is to incorrectly use data structures. For example, if you are asked to store a list of numbers, you need to make sure that the list is large enough to hold all of the numbers.
5. **Incorrect use of algorithms**. Another common mistake is to incorrectly use algorithms. For example, if you are asked to find the maximum element in a list, you need to make sure that the list is not empty.
6. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers**. Another common mistake is to incorrectly use floating-point numbers. For example, if you are asked to compute ```1.0 / 0.0```, you will get an infinite number.
7. **Incorrect use of pointers**. Another common mistake is to incorrectly use pointers. For example, if you are given a pointer to a variable, you need to make sure that you do not dereference the pointer before it has been initialized.

Pain points:
1. The input format is not specified clearly. For example, is the first line "<N> <K> <P>", or "<N> <K> <P> <A1> <A2> ... <AN>", or something else?
2. The output format is not specified clearly. For example, is the output "<Yes>" or "<Yes> <A> <B>", or something else?
3. The problem statement is not clear. For example, what does "One frog can send a message to another one if the distance between them is less or equal to K" mean? Does it mean that if the distance between two frogs is less than K, then they can send messages to each other? Or does it mean that if the distance between two frogs is less than or equal to K, then they can send messages to each other?
4. The constraints are not specified clearly. For example, what does "1 ≤ N, P ≤ 10^5" mean? Does it mean that N and P must be integers between 1 and 10^5, inclusive? Or does it mean that N and P must be non-negative integers less than or equal to 10^5?
5. The example input and output are not correct. For example, the example input should be "<N> <K> <P> <A1> <A2> ... <AN>", but the example input is "<N> <K> <P>".
6. The example output is not correct. For example, the example output should be "<Yes> <A> <B>", but the example output is "<Yes>".

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement is not very clear, and it can be easy to misinterpret what it is asking you to do. Make sure you understand the problem statement carefully before you start working on a solution.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution to this problem is not trivial, and it is easy to make mistakes in your implementation. Be careful to double-check your code for errors before submitting it.
3. **Incorrect test cases.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly. Make sure you create a variety of test cases, including cases that test the boundaries of your solution.
4. **Incorrect runtime.** The time complexity of your solution is important, and you should make sure that it is as efficient as possible. Use a variety of techniques to optimize your solution, such as using data structures that are appropriate for the problem, and using efficient algorithms.
5. **Incorrect memory usage.** The memory usage of your solution is also important, and you should make sure that it is as small as possible. Use a variety of techniques to optimize your solution, such as using data structures that are appropriate for the problem, and using efficient algorithms.

**Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement:** A developer might incorrectly assume that the problem is asking them to find the minimum number of units of grass that the villagers need to buy in order to feed all of the dinosaurs. However, the problem is actually asking them to find the minimum number of units of grass that the villagers need to buy in order to feed all of the dinosaurs and then return home.
* **Incorrect implementation of the solution:** A developer might incorrectly implement the solution by using a brute force approach that takes O(n^2) time. A more efficient solution would be to use a greedy algorithm that takes O(n) time.
* **Incorrect test cases:** A developer might create test cases that are too easy or too difficult. This can make it difficult to identify bugs in the solution. A good set of test cases should include cases that test the boundaries of the solution, such as cases where the number of villages is small or large, and cases where the values in the array D are small or large.
* **Incorrect runtime:** A developer might implement the solution in a way that has a very high time complexity. This can make the solution impractical for large inputs. A good solution should have a time complexity that is O(n) or better.
* **Incorrect memory usage:** A developer might implement the solution in a way that uses a lot of memory. This can make the solution impractical for large inputs. A good solution should have a memory usage that is O(n) or better.

CODEFORCES 1011_C. Fly

Pain points:

 **Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement is quite long and detailed, so it is easy to miss some important details. For example, it is not immediately obvious that the rocket must spend fuel to carry both useful cargo and the fuel itself.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for solving this problem is not trivial, and it is easy to make mistakes. For example, it is important to keep track of the total weight of the rocket, including the fuel, and to ensure that the rocket always has enough fuel to take off and land.
3. **Incorrect testing.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly on all possible inputs. For example, you should test your solution on inputs with different numbers of planets, different weights of the payload, and different take-off and landing coefficients.
4. **Incorrect submission.** When submitting your solution, it is important to make sure that you follow the submission guidelines carefully. For example, you should make sure that your solution is in the correct format and that you include all of the required files.

Here are some specific examples of problems that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer may incorrectly assume that the rocket only needs to carry the weight of the payload. This would lead to an incorrect answer, as the rocket also needs to carry the weight of the fuel itself.
* The developer may incorrectly implement the algorithm for taking off and landing. For example, they may not correctly account for the fact that the rocket's weight changes when it takes off or lands.
* The developer may not test their solution thoroughly enough. This could lead to them missing a bug that only occurs on certain inputs.
* The developer may incorrectly submit their solution. For example, they may not include all of the required files or they may not follow the submission guidelines.

By avoiding these common problems, you can increase your chances of submitting a correct and efficient solution to this problem.

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always followed correctly. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. This can cause the program to crash or to output incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The input data may be of the wrong type. For example, the numbers may be entered as strings instead of integers. This can cause the program to crash or to output incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect calculation.** The program may incorrectly calculate the results. This can happen if the program has a bug, or if the input data is too large.
4. **Incorrect output.** The program may output the results in the wrong format. This can happen if the program has a bug, or if the input data is too large.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The program may not handle errors correctly. This can happen if the program has a bug, or if the input data is invalid.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format, the data types, the calculations, the output format, and the error handling.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1059_C. Sequence Transformation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the GCD algorithm.** The GCD algorithm is a well-known and well-tested algorithm, but it is still possible to make mistakes when implementing it. For example, one common mistake is to divide both arguments by their greatest common divisor instead of multiplying them. This will result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The input to this problem can be any integer from 1 to 10^6, so it is important to handle all of the possible edge cases. For example, if the input is 1, the output should be 1.
3. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem requires you to output a sequence of n integers, so you will need to use a data structure that can store a sequence of integers. A simple array is sufficient for this problem, but you could also use a more complex data structure if you prefer.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The logic for this problem is relatively straightforward, but it is still possible to make mistakes. For example, you might forget to remove an element from the sequence after you append the GCD to the result.
5. **Failure to test your code.** It is always important to test your code before submitting it to a competition. This will help you to catch any errors that you may have made.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that you might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect implementation of the GCD algorithm:**

```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```

This implementation of the GCD algorithm is incorrect because it divides both arguments by their greatest common divisor instead of multiplying them. This will result in an incorrect answer.

* **Incorrect handling of edge cases:**

```
def solve(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [1]
    else:
        return [1] + solve(n - 1)
```

This implementation of the solve function is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the input is 1. In this case, the output should be [1], not [1] + solve(n - 1).

* **Incorrect use of data structures:**

```
def solve(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result.append(gcd(result[-1], i))
    return result
```

This implementation of the solve function is incorrect because it uses a list as a data structure. A list is not the most efficient data structure for this problem, as it requires O(n) time to append an element to the list. A more efficient data structure would be a heap, which requires O(log n) time to append an element.

* **Incorrect logic:**

```
def solve(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result.append(gcd(result[-1], i))
    result.pop()
    return result
```

This implementation of the solve function is incorrect because it removes an element from the result after it has appended the GCD to the result. This will result in an incorrect answer.

* **Failure to test your code:**

```
def solve(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result.append(gcd(result[-1], i))
    return result


def main():
    n = int(input())
    print(*solve(n))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This implementation of the main function does not test the solve function. This means that you will not know if the solve function is correct until you submit it to a competition. It is always a good idea to test your code before submitting it to a competition.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1188_A2. Add on a Tree: Revolution

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly and in the correct format. For example, if you are reading the input as a list of lists, you will need to make sure that each list has exactly three elements. If you are reading the input as a string, you will need to make sure that the string is formatted correctly.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also very specific. It is important to make sure that you are outputting the correct information in the correct format. For example, you need to make sure that you are using the correct number of spaces between each element in the output. You also need to make sure that you are using the correct characters to represent the different types of data.

**3. Incorrect data type**

The data in this problem is all integers. It is important to make sure that you are correctly converting the input data to the correct data type. For example, if the input data is a string, you will need to convert it to an integer before you can use it in your program.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

This problem is very easy to make off-by-one errors in. For example, if you are trying to find the maximum value in a list, you need to make sure that you are checking the last element in the list. If you forget to check the last element, you will get an incorrect answer.

**5. Logical errors**

This problem is also very easy to make logical errors in. For example, if you are trying to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, you need to make sure that you are not counting the same edge twice. If you accidentally count the same edge twice, you will get an incorrect answer.

**6. Runtime errors**

This problem is also very easy to get runtime errors in. For example, if you are trying to allocate too much memory, your program will crash. If you are trying to access an element in a list that does not exist, your program will also crash.

**7. Memory leaks**

This problem is also very easy to get memory leaks in. For example, if you are not freeing up memory that you are no longer using, your program will eventually run out of memory and crash.

CODEFORCES 1290_C. Prefix Enlightenment

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement is quite long and detailed, so it is important to read it carefully and make sure that you understand all of the requirements. One common mistake is to assume that the subsets are disjoint, when in fact they are only required to be pairwise disjoint. This can lead to incorrect solutions.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for solving this problem is relatively straightforward, but there are a few details that are easy to get wrong. One common mistake is to forget to update the state of the lamps after each operation. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect testing.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. One common mistake is to test your solution on a small number of inputs, when in fact the problem statement requires that your solution work on all possible inputs. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect submission.** Once you have verified that your solution is correct, it is important to submit it correctly. One common mistake is to forget to include the header file `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This can lead to compilation errors.
5. **Incorrect runtime.** The problem statement specifies a time limit of 1 second. If your solution does not meet this time limit, it will be marked as incorrect. One common mistake is to use an inefficient algorithm. This can lead to solutions that run too slowly.

**Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement:** A developer may incorrectly assume that the subsets are disjoint, when in fact they are only required to be pairwise disjoint. This can lead to a solution that incorrectly counts the number of operations required to turn on all of the lamps.
* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm:** A developer may forget to update the state of the lamps after each operation. This can lead to a solution that incorrectly counts the number of operations required to turn on all of the lamps.
* **Incorrect testing:** A developer may test their solution on a small number of inputs, when in fact the problem statement requires that your solution work on all possible inputs. This can lead to a solution that incorrectly counts the number of operations required to turn on all of the lamps.
* **Incorrect submission:** A developer may forget to include the header file `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This can lead to compilation errors.
* **Incorrect runtime:** A developer may use an inefficient algorithm. This can lead to solutions that run too slowly and are marked as incorrect.

**To avoid these problems, it is important to:**

* Read the problem statement carefully and make sure that you understand all of the requirements.
* Implement the algorithm carefully and make sure that you update the state of the lamps after each operation.
* Test your solution thoroughly on a variety of inputs.
* Submit your solution correctly and make sure that it meets the time limit.

Pain points:
**Possible problems:**

* The input format is not well-defined. For example, it is not clear whether the first line of each test case contains the number of test cases or the length of the arrays.
* The output format is not well-defined. For example, it is not clear whether the output should be "YES" or "yes".
* The problem statement is not clear. For example, it is not clear what happens if the arrays are not the same length.
* The problem is not well-specified. For example, it is not clear what happens if the arrays contain duplicate elements.
* The problem is too difficult. For example, it is not clear how to solve the problem in a polynomial time.
* The problem is too easy. For example, the problem can be solved by a simple brute-force algorithm.

**Possible bugs:**

* The code may not handle the input correctly. For example, the code may crash if the input is not in the correct format.
* The code may not produce the correct output. For example, the code may output "YES" when the arrays are not equal or "NO" when the arrays are equal.
* The code may be inefficient. For example, the code may take a long time to run or use a lot of memory.
* The code may be difficult to understand. For example, the code may be poorly written or use complex algorithms.

CODEFORCES 1373_D. Maximum Sum on Even Positions

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format of the problem states that the first line should contain one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4) — the number of test cases. However, if the input contains a different number of test cases, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format of the problem states that for each test case, you should print the answer on the separate line — the maximum possible sum of elements on even positions after reversing at most one subarray (continuous subsegment) of a. However, if the output format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over the array, it is important to make sure that you are not accessing an invalid index. For example, if the array has length n, you should not iterate from index n to n + 1.
4. **Indexing errors.** When accessing elements of the array, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct index. For example, if the array is a[0], a[1], ..., a[n - 1], you should not access a[n].
5. **Arithmetic errors.** When computing the sum of the elements of the array, it is important to make sure that you are doing the calculations correctly. For example, you should not forget to carry over the carry when adding two numbers.
6. **Memory errors.** If the program allocates too much memory, it may crash or produce incorrect output. It is important to make sure that the program only allocates the amount of memory that it needs.
7. **Time complexity.** The program should run in time O(n), where n is the length of the array. If the program runs in more time than this, it may time out on the judge.
8. **Space complexity.** The program should use O(1) extra space, where n is the length of the array. If the program uses more space than this, it may run out of memory on the judge.

**Possible Problems and Bugs**

1. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum time to finish the game.** This could happen if the developer does not take into account all of the factors that affect the time, such as the number of monsters in each level, the reload time of the guns, and the time it takes to move between levels.
2. **Using an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem.** There are many different ways to solve this problem, and some algorithms may be more efficient than others. The developer should choose an algorithm that is appropriate for the problem and the data set.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** This could happen if the developer makes a mistake in the code, such as a typo or a logic error. The developer should carefully test the code to ensure that it is correct.
4. **Incorrect input or output.** The developer should make sure that the input and output are formatted correctly.
5. **Memory leaks or other runtime errors.** The developer should use a memory management tool to check for memory leaks and other runtime errors.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully design and implement the solution, and then thoroughly test it.

Title:
CODEFORCES 148_D. Bag of mice

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect calculation of the probability of drawing a white mouse.**

The probability of drawing a white mouse is not simply `w / (w + b)`. This is because the dragon may draw a black mouse, which will cause one of the remaining mice to jump out of the bag. This means that the probability of drawing a white mouse on the princess's first turn is actually `w / (w + b + 1)`.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the probability of the dragon winning.**

The dragon wins if the princess does not draw a white mouse before the bag is empty. The probability of this happening is `(b + 1) / (w + b + 1)`.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the princess's overall probability of winning.**

The princess's overall probability of winning is the probability of her drawing a white mouse on her first turn, plus the probability of the dragon drawing a black mouse and not winning on his first turn, plus the probability of the dragon drawing a black mouse and winning on his second turn, and so on. This can be calculated using a recursive formula.

**4. Floating-point rounding errors.**

When calculating the probability of the princess winning, it is important to use a high enough precision to avoid rounding errors. This can be done by using the `Decimal` class in Python, or by using the `fmod()` function in C++.

**5. Incorrect handling of edge cases.**

The problem statement specifies that the input values `w` and `b` must be non-negative integers. However, it is possible for a user to input invalid values, such as `w = -1` or `b = 1001`. The program should handle these cases gracefully by either printing an error message or by exiting with an appropriate error code.

Title:
CODEFORCES 259_D. Little Elephant and Elections

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator.**

The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. For example, 10 % 3 = 1. This means that 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.

In the problem statement, we are told to print the remainder from dividing the answer by 1000000007. This means that we need to use the modulo operator with a modulus of 1000000007.

If we accidentally use the modulo operator with a different modulus, the answer will be incorrect.

**2. Using the wrong data type.**

The problem statement tells us that the input will be a single positive integer. This means that we need to use an integer data type to store the input.

If we accidentally use a floating-point data type, the input will be interpreted as a floating-point number. This will cause the program to crash.

**3. Not handling invalid input.**

The problem statement tells us that the input will be a single positive integer. However, it is possible that the input will not be valid. For example, the input could be a negative number or a non-integer.

If we do not handle invalid input, the program will crash.

**4. Not using the correct algorithm.**

The problem statement asks us to find the number of correct assignments such that the number of lucky digits in the Little Elephant Political Party ballot number is strictly larger than the total number of lucky digits in the ballot numbers of 6 other parties.

There are a number of different algorithms that we could use to solve this problem. However, we need to make sure that we use the correct algorithm.

If we use the wrong algorithm, the answer will be incorrect.

**5. Not using the correct data structures.**

The problem statement does not specify the data structures that we can use to solve the problem. However, we need to make sure that we use the correct data structures.

If we use the wrong data structures, the program will run inefficiently.

**6. Not using the correct time and space complexity.**

The problem statement does not specify the time and space complexity that we need to use to solve the problem. However, we need to make sure that our solution is efficient.

If our solution is not efficient, it will take too long to run or it will use too much memory.
Test inputs:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator.**

```

Title:
CODEFORCES 493_A. Vasya and Football

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if you forget to put a space between two words, the program will not be able to print the output correctly.

**3. Undefined behavior**

The problem statement does not specify what should happen if there are no red cards in the input. Some programs might print an empty output, while others might crash. It is important to make sure that your program handles this case correctly.

**4. Memory leaks**

It is important to make sure that your program does not leak memory. This can be done by using the `delete` keyword to free up memory that is no longer needed.

**5. Race conditions**

If your program is multi-threaded, it is important to make sure that you avoid race conditions. A race condition occurs when two threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even crashes.

**6. Deadlocks**

If your program is multi-threaded, it is also important to make sure that you avoid deadlocks. A deadlock occurs when two threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can prevent both threads from making progress and can eventually lead to a crash.

**7. Security vulnerabilities**

It is important to make sure that your program is secure. This means that you should protect your program from attacks such as buffer overflows and SQL injection.

**8. Unit tests**

It is important to write unit tests for your program. Unit tests help you to catch bugs early in the development process.

**9. Code review**

It is always a good idea to have your code reviewed by someone else. A code review can help you to catch bugs that you might have missed.

**10. Documentation**

It is important to document your code so that other developers can understand how it works. Documentation can also help you to remember how your code works in the future.

Title:
CODEFORCES 543_E. Listening to Music

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain a number that is too large or too small. The developer should check the input format and handle incorrect input gracefully.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correctly followed. For example, the output may contain a number that is too large or too small. The developer should check the output format and handle incorrect output gracefully.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The developer may make a mistake in the calculation. For example, the developer may use the wrong formula or may make a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm. The developer should carefully check the calculation and make sure that it is correct.
4. **Memory leak**. The developer may not free the memory that is allocated during the execution of the program. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash. The developer should make sure to free all allocated memory when it is no longer needed.
5. **Synchronization issues**. The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared resources. This can lead to race conditions, which can cause the program to produce incorrect results or to crash. The developer should carefully synchronize access to shared resources to avoid these problems.

Title:
CODEFORCES 570_B. Simple Game

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is two integers, n and m, separated by a space. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to parse the input and will throw an error.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the probability of winning**

The probability of Andrew winning is equal to the number of integers between m and n that are closer to m than a divided by the total number of integers between 1 and n. This calculation can be done incorrectly if the programmer does not account for the fact that m and a may be equal.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The optimal strategy for Andrew is to choose the integer a that is closest to the midpoint between m and n. However, if the programmer does not use the correct algorithm, they may choose an incorrect value of a.

**4. Not handling special cases**

The problem statement specifies that if m and a are located on the same distance from c, Misha wins. The programmer must handle this special case correctly.

**5. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved in O(1) time using the following algorithm:

```
1. Calculate the midpoint between m and n.
2. If m and a are equal, return m.
3. Otherwise, return the midpoint.
```

This algorithm is much more efficient than the naive algorithm that iterates over all integers between m and n and calculates the probability of winning for each one.

CODEFORCES 633_C. Spy Syndrome 2

Pain points:
**1. The input may contain invalid characters.** For example, the input string may contain non-alphabetic characters, such as numbers or punctuation marks. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. The input may be too long. If the input string is longer than the maximum allowed length, the program may not be able to process it correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 661_F. Primes in Interval

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The most common mistake is to use an incorrect algorithm to find the prime numbers in the given interval. A common incorrect algorithm is to check if each number in the interval is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the number. This algorithm is incorrect because it does not account for composite numbers that are not divisible by any number from 2 to their square root.

**2. Using an incorrect data type**

Another common mistake is to use an incorrect data type to store the numbers in the interval. For example, if the interval contains numbers that are larger than the maximum value that can be stored in an integer, the program will crash.

**3. Using an incorrect boundary condition**

Another common mistake is to use an incorrect boundary condition when checking if a number is prime. For example, if the program checks if a number is prime by dividing it by all numbers from 2 to the square root of the number, it will not correctly identify numbers that are divisible by 2.

**4. Using an incorrect loop condition**

Another common mistake is to use an incorrect loop condition when iterating over the numbers in the interval. For example, if the program iterates over the numbers from a to b + 1, it will incorrectly count the number b as a prime number.

**5. Using an incorrect output format**

Another common mistake is to use an incorrect output format when printing the number of prime numbers in the interval. For example, if the program prints the number of prime numbers as a floating-point number, it will not be correct.

**6. Using an incorrect variable name**

Another common mistake is to use an incorrect variable name when storing the number of prime numbers in the interval. For example, if the program uses the variable name "primes" to store the number of prime numbers, it will be difficult to understand what the variable is used for.

**7. Using an incorrect comment**

Another common mistake is to use an incorrect comment when explaining the code. For example, if the program uses a comment to say that the code is "finding the prime numbers in the interval", it will be difficult for other programmers to understand what the code is actually doing.

Pain points:
 1. The first possible bug is that the developer might not correctly parse the input. For example, they might not correctly handle the case where the input contains a newline character in the middle of a number.
2. The second possible bug is that the developer might not correctly implement the logic of the problem. For example, they might not correctly handle the case where a child asks for more ice cream than Kay and Gerda have.
3. The third possible bug is that the developer might not correctly format the output. For example, they might not output the two numbers on separate lines, or they might not output the numbers in the correct order.
4. The fourth possible bug is that the developer might not correctly handle the edge cases. For example, they might not correctly handle the case where Kay and Gerda have no ice cream at the beginning of the day, or they might not correctly handle the case where there are no children in the queue.
5. The fifth possible bug is that the developer might not correctly optimize their code. For example, they might not use an efficient data structure to store the ice cream packs, or they might not use an efficient algorithm to find the number of distressed kids.

CODEFORCES 708_E. Student's Camp

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data contains two integers n and m, which represent the size of the destructible part of the building. If these integers are large, they may not fit into the default integer data type. To avoid this problem, you can use the long long data type.

**2. Not handling corner cases**

The problem statement states that the integers a and b in the second line are coprime. This means that they have no common factors other than 1. If you do not handle this corner case, your code may produce incorrect results.

**3. Using incorrect math formulas**

The problem statement asks you to find the probability that Alex will not have to look for other opportunities and will be able to spend the summer in this camp. This probability can be calculated using the following formula:

<image>

where p is the probability that a block is destroyed, n is the number of blocks in the destructible part of the building, and k is the number of days and nights that the strong wind will blow for.

**4. Not using the right algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming algorithm. This algorithm works by building up a table of values, where each value represents the probability that the building will not collapse after k days and nights of strong wind. The algorithm starts by initializing the table to all 0s. Then, it iterates over all possible values of k, starting from 0. For each value of k, the algorithm computes the probability that the building will not collapse after k days and nights of strong wind, using the following formula:

<image>

where p is the probability that a block is destroyed, n is the number of blocks in the destructible part of the building, and i is the number of days and nights that have already passed.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it to the competition. This will help you to identify and fix any bugs that may be present in your code.

**6. Submitting your code on time**

The competition is timed, so it is important to submit your code on time. If you submit your code after the deadline, it will not be eligible for scoring.

CODEFORCES 730_B. Minimum and Maximum

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format of the problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when writing your code. For example, you might forget to flush the output after each line, or you might not use the correct format for the indices of the elements to compare. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm for finding the minimum and maximum elements of an array is not as simple as it might seem. It is easy to make a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm, which can lead to incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect runtime.** The algorithm for finding the minimum and maximum elements of an array should run in time O(⌈n⌉). If your algorithm runs in more time than this, it will not be able to solve all of the test cases.
4. **Incorrect memory usage.** The algorithm for finding the minimum and maximum elements of an array should not use more than O(n) memory. If your algorithm uses more memory than this, it will not be able to solve all of the test cases.
5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other potential bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem. For example, you might forget to initialize variables, or you might use the wrong data type for a variable. These kinds of bugs can be difficult to find, so it is important to be careful when writing your code.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and to understand the input and output formats. You should also carefully design and implement your algorithm, and you should test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct.

CODEFORCES 774_F. Pens And Days Of Week

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a negative number or a number that is too large.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may contain a number that is not an integer or a number that is not in the range specified in the problem statement.
3. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm may not be correct. For example, the algorithm may not find the correct answer or the algorithm may take too long to run.
4. **Incorrect data structure.** The data structure may not be appropriate for the problem. For example, the data structure may be too slow or the data structure may not be able to store all of the data.
5. **Incorrect implementation.** The implementation of the algorithm may contain bugs. For example, the implementation may not handle all of the possible cases or the implementation may not be efficient.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and to understand the problem before starting to code. It is also important to test the code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct and that it runs efficiently.

Title:
CODEFORCES 799_F. Beautiful fountains rows

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct.**

The input format is two integers n and m, followed by n lines of two integers li and ri. However, the input format in the problem statement is incorrect. It should be two integers n and m, followed by n lines of three integers li, ri, and ci, where ci is the number of fountains in the ith garden.

**2. The output format is not correct.**

The output format is one integer: the total length of all suitable segments. However, the output format in the problem statement is incorrect. It should be one integer: the total number of suitable segments.

**3. The problem is not well-defined.**

The problem statement does not specify what happens if there are no gardens with an odd number of fountains. Does Ostin just show the empty segment from a to b? Or does he not show any segment at all?

**4. The problem is too easy.**

The problem can be solved in O(n) time. This is too easy for a problem on Codeforces.

**5. The problem is too hard.**

The problem cannot be solved in polynomial time. This is too hard for a problem on Codeforces.

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input string may not contain any characters other than lowercase Latin letters. If the input string contains any other characters, the program should raise an error.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output string must contain only lowercase Latin letters. If the output string contains any other characters, the program should raise an error.
3. **Incorrect processing of the input string**. The program should remove all pairs of identical consecutive letters from the input string. If the program fails to remove all pairs of identical consecutive letters, the output string will be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect handling of empty input strings**. The input string may be empty. If the input string is empty, the program should output an empty string.
5. **Incorrect handling of strings with only one character**. The input string may contain only one character. If the input string contains only one character, the program should output the same character.
6. **Incorrect handling of strings with two identical consecutive characters**. The input string may contain two identical consecutive characters. If the input string contains two identical consecutive characters, the program should remove both characters from the string.
7. **Incorrect handling of strings with more than two identical consecutive characters**. The input string may contain more than two identical consecutive characters. If the input string contains more than two identical consecutive characters, the program should remove all pairs of identical consecutive characters from the string.
8. **Incorrect handling of strings with non-consecutive identical characters**. The input string may contain non-consecutive identical characters. If the input string contains non-consecutive identical characters, the program should not remove any characters from the string.
9. **Incorrect handling of strings with duplicate characters**. The input string may contain duplicate characters. If the input string contains duplicate characters, the program should remove all duplicate characters from the string.
10. **Incorrect handling of strings with special characters**. The input string may contain special characters. If the input string contains special characters, the program should remove all special characters from the string.

CODEFORCES 845_D. Driving Test

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input format is not clear. For example, it is not clear whether the speed limit is a single integer or a range of integers.
* The output format is not clear. For example, it is not clear whether the output should be a single integer or a list of integers.
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if Polycarp violates the rules. For example, does he fail the driving test?
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if Polycarp does not notice a sign. For example, does the sign still have an effect?
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if Polycarp overtakes a car when it is not allowed. For example, does he fail the driving test?
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if Polycarp's speed is too high. For example, does he fail the driving test?

**Possible solutions:**

* To clarify the input format, the problem statement could be rewritten to say that the speed limit is a single integer.
* To clarify the output format, the problem statement could be rewritten to say that the output should be a single integer.
* To clarify what happens if Polycarp violates the rules, the problem statement could be rewritten to say that he fails the driving test.

CODEFORCES 865_F. Egg Roulette

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always strictly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by a space. The developer should make sure to handle these cases correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format should be strictly followed. For example, the output should always be a single integer, and it should not contain any extra characters. The developer should make sure to handle this case correctly.
3. **Incorrect calculation of unfairness**. The unfairness of an ordering is calculated by subtracting the first player's win probability from the second player's win probability. The developer should make sure to calculate this value correctly.
4. **Incorrect determination of valid orderings**. An ordering is valid if it contains the same number of 'A's as 'B's. The developer should make sure to check this condition correctly.
5. **Incorrect matching of orderings**. An ordering is said to match S if it only differs from S in positions where S contains a '?'. The developer should make sure to check this condition correctly.
6. **Incorrect counting of matching orderings**. The number of matching orderings is the number of valid orderings that minimize unfairness and match S. The developer should make sure to calculate this value correctly.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. Use a robust input parsing library to handle incorrect input formats.
2. Use a unit testing framework to test your code for correctness.
3. Use a debugger to help you track down errors in your code.
4. Ask for help from other developers if you are stuck.

CODEFORCES 892_A. Greed

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is given as a string, but the developer may accidentally parse it as an integer. This will cause the program to crash.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may accidentally iterate over the array one element too many or too few. This will cause the program to miss a can or count a can twice.
3. **Incorrect comparison**. The developer may accidentally compare two values using the wrong operator. This will cause the program to give the wrong answer.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program. This will cause the program to give the wrong answer.
5. **Memory leak**. The developer may accidentally create a memory leak. This will cause the program to use up more memory than it needs, and eventually crash.
6. **Timeout**. The developer may write a program that takes too long to run. This will cause the program to time out and not give an answer.
7. **Security vulnerability**. The developer may accidentally introduce a security vulnerability in the program. This could allow a malicious user to gain access to the program's data or control the program's behavior.

Title:
CODEFORCES 914_A. Perfect Squares

Pain points:
1. **Using the wrong algorithm.** The most common mistake is to use a brute-force algorithm to find all perfect squares in the array and then find the largest number that is not a perfect square. This is inefficient, as it requires O(n^2) time.
2. **Not handling negative numbers correctly.** The problem statement specifies that the input numbers can be negative, but many algorithms for finding perfect squares assume that the input numbers are non-negative. This can lead to errors if the input contains negative numbers.
3. **Not handling floating-point numbers correctly.** The problem statement specifies that the input numbers are integers, but many algorithms for finding perfect squares work with floating-point numbers. This can lead to errors if the input contains integers that are close to perfect squares.
4. **Not handling overflow correctly.** The problem statement specifies that the input numbers can be up to 10^6, but many algorithms for finding perfect squares assume that the input numbers are much smaller. This can lead to overflow errors if the input contains large numbers.
5. **Not handling degenerate cases correctly.** The problem statement specifies that at least one element of the array is not a perfect square, but many algorithms for finding perfect squares assume that all of the input numbers are perfect squares. This can lead to errors if the input contains no perfect squares.
6. **Not using the right data structures.** The problem statement does not specify what data structures can be used, but many algorithms for finding perfect squares use data structures that are not efficient for the given input. This can lead to inefficient solutions.
7. **Not using the right algorithms.** The problem statement does not specify what algorithms can be used, but many algorithms for finding perfect squares are not efficient for the given input. This can lead to inefficient solutions.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. **Use a divide-and-conquer algorithm to find all perfect squares in the array.** This algorithm is much more efficient than a brute-force algorithm, as it only requires O(n) time.
2. **Handle negative numbers correctly by using the absolute value of each number.** This will ensure that the algorithm works correctly for both positive and negative numbers.
3. **Handle floating-point numbers correctly by rounding each number to the nearest integer.** This will ensure that the algorithm works correctly for numbers that are close to perfect squares.
4. **Handle overflow correctly by using a data type that is large enough to store the largest possible input number.** This will prevent overflow errors from occurring.
5. **Handle degenerate cases correctly by checking if the input array is empty or contains no perfect squares.** This will prevent errors from occurring in these cases.
6. **Use the right data structures for the given input.** This will ensure that the algorithm is efficient for the given input.
7. **Use the right algorithms for the given input.** This will ensure that the algorithm is efficient for the given input.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n, and the second line should contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. However, the input may contain an incorrect number of lines, or the lines may not contain the correct number of integers.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n, and the second line should contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. However, the input may contain non-integer values, such as strings or floating-point numbers.
3. **Incorrect values.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n, and the second line should contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. However, the input may contain values that are out of range, such as negative integers or integers greater than 10,000.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** When computing the index of the day when Polycarp will celebrate the equator, it is important to remember that the index of the first day is 1, not 0.
5. **Incorrect logic.** The algorithm for computing the index of the day when Polycarp will celebrate the equator is relatively straightforward, but it is important to make sure that you understand the logic and that you implement it correctly.
6. **Runtime errors.** The algorithm for computing the index of the day when Polycarp will celebrate the equator should run in O(n) time, where n is the number of days in the training plan. However, if you implement the algorithm incorrectly, it may run in O(n^2) time or even worse.
7. **Memory errors.** The algorithm for computing the index of the day when Polycarp will celebrate the equator should not use more than O(n) memory, where n is the number of days in the training plan. However, if you implement the algorithm incorrectly, it may use more memory than necessary.

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a single integer, but the user may enter a string or a list of numbers.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a fraction in the form `a/b`, where `a` and `b` are integers and `b` is not equal to 0. The user may output a string that is not in the correct format, or they may output a fraction where `b` is equal to 0.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the expected number of tosses.** The expected number of tosses is equal to `1 + 2 + ... + n`, where `n` is the number of knights. The user may incorrectly calculate this sum, or they may use a different formula for the expected number of tosses.

The input format is not specified clearly in the problem statement. It is not clear whether the input should be a list of integers or a string of numbers. This could lead to confusion and bugs.

**2. The output format is not specified clearly.**

The output format is not specified clearly in the problem statement. It is not clear whether the output should be a list of integers or a string of numbers. This could lead to confusion and bugs.

**3. The problem is not well-defined.**

The problem is not well-defined. It is not clear what is meant by "buildings of the city are of same shape". Does this mean that all the buildings have the same height? Or does it mean that all the buildings have the same width? This could lead to confusion and bugs.

**4. The problem is not easy to understand.**

HACKEREARTH chacha-chaudhary-and-sabu

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) should be used after all calculations have been performed, not in the middle of an expression. For example, the following code will not produce the correct result:

```
a = 10
b = 3
print(a % b)
```

The correct way to write this code is:

```
a = 10
b = 3
print(a % b)
```

2. **Incorrect use of parentheses.** Parentheses are used to group together expressions and to indicate the order of operations. For example, the following code will not produce the correct result:

```
a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b * 2)
```

The correct way to write this code is:

```
a = 10
b = 3
print(a + (b * 2))
```

3. **Incorrect use of the exponentiation operator.** The exponentiation operator (**) raises the first operand to the power of the second operand. For example, the following code will produce the correct result:

```
a = 2
b = 3
print(a ** b)
```

The correct way to write this code is:

```
a = 2
b = 3
print(a ** b)
```

4. **Incorrect use of the division operator.** The division operator (/) divides the first operand by the second operand. For example, the following code will produce the correct result:

```
a = 10
b = 3
print(a / b)
```

The correct way to write this code is:

```
a = 10
b = 3
print(a / b)
```

5. **Incorrect use of the modulus operator.** The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of the first operand divided by the second operand. For example, the following code will produce the correct result:

```
a = 10
b = 3
print(a % b)
```

The correct way to write this code is:

```
a = 10

Title:
HACKEREARTH generate-composite-numbers

Pain points:
**1. Using an inefficient algorithm**

The most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem is to use an inefficient algorithm. For example, a naive algorithm would check every number from 2 to n to see if it is divisible by any number from 2 to n-1. This algorithm would have a time complexity of O(n^2), which is too slow for the time limit of 1 second.

**2. Using a incorrect algorithm**

Another common mistake is to use an incorrect algorithm. For example, a common incorrect algorithm is to check if a number is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the number. This algorithm is incorrect because it does not account for numbers that are divisible by perfect squares. For example, the number 9 is divisible by 3, but it is not divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of 9 (which is 3).

**3. Not handling the boundary cases correctly**

Another common mistake is to not handle the boundary cases correctly. For example, the input could be 0 or 1, which are not composite numbers. The output should also not include the number n, since it is not a composite number.

**4. Using floating-point numbers**

Another common mistake is to use floating-point numbers when working with integers. This can lead to rounding errors, which can cause the program to produce incorrect results.

**5. Not using the right data structures**

The right data structures can help to improve the performance of your program. For example, using a hash table to store the composite numbers can speed up the process of finding all the composite numbers within a given range.

**6. Not using the right algorithms**

The right algorithms can also help to improve the performance of your program. For example, using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all the prime numbers within a given range can be much faster than using a naive algorithm.

**7. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code to make sure that it is working correctly. This includes testing for all of the possible input cases, as well as testing for boundary cases and incorrect inputs.

**8. Not debugging your code**

If your code is not working correctly, it is important to debug your code to find the source of the problem. This can be done by using a debugger or by printing out the values of variables at different points in the code.

HACKEREARTH least-common-multiple

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the LCM algorithm.** The LCM algorithm is a recursive function that takes two integers as input and returns their least common multiple. A common mistake is to use the wrong base case. The base case for the LCM algorithm should be when one of the inputs is 0, in which case the LCM is equal to the other input.
2. **Incorrect handling of negative integers.** The LCM algorithm does not work correctly for negative integers. If either of the inputs is negative, the LCM will be negative.
3. **Incorrect handling of floating-point numbers.** The LCM algorithm does not work correctly for floating-point numbers. If either of the inputs is a floating-point number, the LCM will be a floating-point number.
4. **Incorrect handling of large integers.** The LCM algorithm can be very slow for large integers. This is because the algorithm is recursive, and each recursive call requires multiplying two integers. For large integers, this multiplication can be very time-consuming.
5. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The LCM algorithm can overflow for large integers. This is because the algorithm is recursive, and each recursive call requires multiplying two integers. For large integers, the product of two integers can overflow.
6. **Incorrect handling of division by zero.** The LCM algorithm can divide by zero if one of the inputs is 0. This is because the LCM of two integers is equal to the integer divided by their greatest common divisor. If one of the inputs is 0, the greatest common divisor is 0, and the LCM is undefined.
7. **Incorrect handling of invalid inputs.** The LCM algorithm can crash if one of the inputs is invalid. This is because the LCM algorithm assumes that both inputs are positive integers. If either of the inputs is negative or not an integer, the LCM algorithm will crash.
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the LCM algorithm.**

```
def lcm(a, b):
  if a == 0:
    return b
  if b == 0:
    return a
  return a * b // gcd(a, b)
```

This implementation of the LCM algorithm is incorrect because it uses the wrong base case. The base case for the LCM algorithm should be when one of the inputs is 0, in which case the LCM is equal to the other input.

```
def lcm(a, b):
  if a == 0:
    return b
  if b == 0:
    return a
  return a * b
```

This implementation of the LCM algorithm is correct.

2. **Incorrect handling of negative integers.**

```
n = int(input())
print(lcm(n, n + 1))
```

This program will crash if `n` is negative because the LCM algorithm does not work correctly for negative integers.

```
n = int(input())
if n < 0:
  print("Invalid input")
else:
  print(lcm(n, n + 1))
```

This program will correctly handle negative integers.

3. **Incorrect handling of floating-point numbers.**

```
n = float(input())
print(lcm(n, n + 1))
```

This program will crash if `n` is a floating-point number because the LCM algorithm does not work correctly for floating-point numbers.

```
n = int(input())
print(lcm(n, n + 1))
```

This program will correctly handle floating-point numbers.

4. **Incorrect handling of large integers.**

```
n = 10**15
print(lcm(n, n + 1))
```

This program will be very slow for large integers because the LCM algorithm is recursive, and each recursive call requires multiplying two integers. For large integers, this multiplication can be very time-consuming.

```
n = 10**15
print(lcm(n, n + 1))
```

This program will correctly handle large integers, but it will be very slow.

5. **Incorrect handling of overflow.**

```
n = 2**64
print(lcm(n, n + 1))
```

This program will crash for large integers because the LCM algorithm can overflow for large integers.

```
n = 2**63 - 1
print(lcm(n, n + 1))
```

This program will correctly handle large integers without overflowing.

6. **Incorrect handling of division by zero.**

```
n = 0
print(lcm(n, n + 1))
```

This program will crash because the LCM algorithm can divide by zero if one of the inputs is 0.

```
n = 1
print(lcm(n, n + 1))
```

This program will correctly handle division by zero.

7. **Incorrect handling of invalid inputs.**

```
n = "abc"
print(lcm(n, n + 1))
```

This program will crash because the LCM algorithm assumes that both inputs are positive integers. If either of the inputs is invalid, the LCM algorithm will crash.

```
n = 1
print(lcm(n, n + 1))
```

This program will correctly handle invalid inputs.
Title:
HACKEREARTH monk-in-the-grass-fields

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input data is a list of lists, but the code tries to iterate over it as a list of integers. This will cause a `TypeError`.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The code calculates the minimum discomfort for each row and column, but then adds 1 to the discomfort of all cells in that row or column. This will cause the minimum discomfort to be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code assumes that the monk will always choose the row or column with the lowest discomfort. This is not always the case, and can lead to a suboptimal solution.
4. **Memory leak**. The code does not free up the memory used by the input data after it is processed. This can lead to a memory leak if the program is run for a long time.
5. **Security vulnerability**. The code does not properly validate the input data. This could allow a malicious user to input data that could crash the program or execute arbitrary code.

HACKEREARTH permutations

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain the size of the permutation, and the second line should contain the permutation itself. However, if the input format is incorrect, the program may not be able to correctly parse the input and may produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect use of the `swap()` function.** The `swap()` function is used to swap two elements in a list. However, if the two elements are not valid indices of the list, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect use of the `min()` function.** The `min()` function is used to find the minimum value in a list. However, if the list is empty, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect use of the `sort()` function.** The `sort()` function is used to sort a list in ascending order. However, if the list is not a list of numbers, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
5. **Incorrect use of the `print()` function.** The `print()` function is used to print the output of the program. However, if the output is not a valid string, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. Additionally, it is important to test the program with a variety of different input values to ensure that it is working correctly.

Title:
HACKEREARTH roy-and-ring-13

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem statement is not very clear, so it is easy to make mistakes in understanding it. For example, one might think that Alfi and Roy move the ring in the same direction, or that they move the ring by the same amount each time.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for computing the perpendicular distance of the ring from the y-axis is not very complicated, but it is easy to make mistakes. For example, one might forget to take into account the fact that Alfi and Roy move the ring in different directions, or that they move the ring by different amounts each time.
3. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem requires storing the history of the ring's movements. If this is not done correctly, it can lead to incorrect results. For example, one might use a data structure that is not capable of storing the history of the ring's movements, or one might use a data structure that is not efficient enough.
4. **Incorrect handling of boundary conditions.** The problem statement specifies some boundary conditions, such as the fact that the number of queries is at most 10000 and the step number is at most 1000000000. If these boundary conditions are not handled correctly, it can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect modular arithmetic.** The problem requires computing the perpendicular distance of the ring from the y-axis modulo 1000000007. If this is not done correctly, it can lead to incorrect results.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement, carefully implement the algorithm, correctly use data structures, correctly handle boundary conditions, and correctly perform modular arithmetic.

Title:
HACKEREARTH subpalindrome-2

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one errors.** When counting the number of subsequences, it is easy to make a mistake and count one too many or one too few. For example, if you are counting the number of substrings of length 3 that are palindromes, you might accidentally count the substring "abc" as two palindromes, one starting at index 0 and one starting at index 1.
2. **Incorrect handling of empty strings.** The problem statement specifies that the empty string is not a palindrome. However, some developers might accidentally count the empty string as a palindrome, which would result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect handling of non-palindromes.** The problem statement specifies that the subsequences must be palindromes. However, some developers might accidentally count non-palindromes as palindromes, which would result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect handling of overlapping subsequences.** The problem statement does not specify whether or not overlapping subsequences should be counted. Some developers might incorrectly count overlapping subsequences as distinct subsequences, which would result in an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect handling of degenerate cases.** The problem statement does not specify how to handle degenerate cases, such as the case where the input string is a single character. Some developers might incorrectly handle these cases, which would result in an incorrect answer.

Title:
ATCODER p02605 M-SOLUTIONS Programming Contest 2020 - Air Safety

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is given in the form of `N`, `X_1`, `Y_1`, `U_1`, `X_2`, `Y_2`, `U_2`, ..., `X_N`, `Y_N`, `U_N`. If we use the wrong data type to store the input data, it may cause problems when we perform calculations on the data. For example, if we use `int` to store the input data, we may get an overflow error when we calculate the distance between two airplanes.

**2. Not handling the corner cases**

The problem statement mentions that the current positions of the N airplanes, (X_i, Y_i), are all distinct. However, it is possible that the input data violates this constraint. For example, the input data may contain two airplanes with the same coordinates. If we do not handle this corner case, our program may crash or give incorrect results.

**3. Using an inefficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved in O(N) time. However, if we use an inefficient algorithm, our program may run slowly. For example, we can solve the problem in O(N^2) time by using a brute-force approach. However, this approach is not efficient for large values of N.

**4. Not using the right data structure**

The problem can be solved using a variety of data structures. However, some data structures are more efficient than others. For example, we can use a priority queue to find the two airplanes that will collide first. This is more efficient than using a sorted array.

**5. Making a mistake in the implementation**

Even if we follow all the steps above, we may still make a mistake in the implementation. For example, we may forget to check for corner cases or we may use the wrong data type. It is important to carefully check our code for mistakes before we submit it.

Title:
ATCODER p02736 AtCoder Grand Contest 043 - 123 Triangle

Pain points:
**1. Off-by-one errors**

The most common bug when solving this problem is an off-by-one error. This can happen when you are computing the values of `x_{i,j}`, or when you are printing the output. To avoid this, be careful to check the indices of your loops and make sure that you are not missing any values.

**2. Incorrect boundary conditions**

Another common bug is to incorrectly handle the boundary conditions of the problem. For example, you may need to special-case the case where `i = 1` or `j = 1`. Make sure to carefully read the problem statement and understand the boundary conditions before you start coding.

**3. Using the wrong data type**

When working with integers, it is important to use the correct data type. For example, if you are working with numbers that are larger than `int`, you will need to use `long long`. Using the wrong data type can lead to incorrect results or even runtime errors.

**4. Not using a fast enough algorithm**

The naive algorithm for solving this problem has a time complexity of `O(N^2)`. This can be improved to `O(N)` by using a dynamic programming approach. Make sure to use a fast enough algorithm to avoid TLE.

**5. Not handling errors correctly**

When reading input from stdin, it is important to handle errors correctly. For example, if the input format is incorrect, you should print an error message and exit the program. Not handling errors correctly can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

Title:
ATCODER p03289 AtCoder Beginner Contest 104 - AcCepted

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the string S should be between 4 and 10 characters long. If the input string is not in this range, the program will not work correctly.
2. **Incorrect use of comparison operators**. The program must compare the characters in the string S to the characters 'A' and 'C' using the == operator. If the wrong operator is used, the program will not work correctly.
3. **Incorrect use of logical operators**. The program must use the && operator to check that all of the conditions in the problem statement are met. If the wrong operator is used, the program will not work correctly.
4. **Incorrect use of string functions**. The program must use the charAt() function to access the individual characters in the string S. If the wrong function is used, the program will not work correctly.
5. **Incorrect use of control flow statements**. The program must use the if statement to check if the conditions in the problem statement are met. If the wrong control flow statement is used, the program will not work correctly.
6. **Incorrect use of output statements**. The program must use the System.out.println() statement to print the output. If the wrong output statement is used, the program will not work correctly.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer might incorrectly check the input format and allow a string that is too short or too long.
* The developer might incorrectly compare the characters in the string S to the characters 'A' and 'C'.
* The developer might incorrectly use the && operator to check that all of the conditions in the problem statement are met.
* The developer might incorrectly use the charAt() function to access the individual characters in the string S.
* The developer might incorrectly use the if statement to check if the conditions in the problem statement are met.
* The developer might incorrectly use the System.out.println() statement to print the output.

ATCODER p03445 AtCoder Petrozavodsk Contest 001 - Simple APSP Problem

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not very clear. It is not clear whether the input should be a list of numbers or a string. This can lead to errors in parsing the input.

**2. Incorrect calculation of shortest distance**

The shortest distance between two points can be calculated in different ways. The most common way is to use the Euclidean distance. However, this is not always the most efficient way. For example, if the two points are on a diagonal, the Euclidean distance will be larger than the actual distance.

**3. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

The problem statement does not explicitly mention any edge cases. However, there are a few edge cases that a developer should be aware of. For example, what happens if the input is invalid? What happens if there are no white squares?

**4. Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic**

Modulo arithmetic is a common operation in programming. However, it is important to understand how it works. For example, if you add two numbers that are both divisible by the modulo, the result will not be divisible by the modulo. This can lead to errors in your calculations.

**5. Incorrect use of floating-point arithmetic**

Floating-point arithmetic is another common operation in programming. However, it is important to understand the limitations of floating-point arithmetic. For example, floating-point numbers are not always exact. This can lead to errors in your calculations.

**6. Incorrect use of recursion**

Recursion is a powerful tool in programming. However, it is important to use it correctly. For example, you should always make sure that your recursive function has a base case. This will prevent your function from getting stuck in an infinite loop.

**7. Incorrect use of dynamic programming**

Dynamic programming is a powerful technique for solving optimization problems. However, it is important to use it correctly. For example, you should always make sure that your dynamic programming table is initialized correctly. This will prevent your algorithm from getting stuck in an infinite loop.

Title:
ATCODER p03605 AtCoder Beginner Contest 073 - September 9

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input is a two-digit integer, so the developer should use `int` or `long` to store it. Using a smaller data type like `char` or `short` could lead to incorrect results.

**2. Using the wrong operator**

The problem asks whether the number contains the digit 9, so the developer should use the `%` operator to check if the number is divisible by 9. Using the `==` operator could lead to incorrect results.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

The problem states that the input is a two-digit integer, but it does not specify what happens if the input is not a two-digit integer. The developer should check if the input is a valid two-digit integer before performing any calculations.

**4. Using incorrect logic**

The developer should use the following logic to solve the problem:

1. Get the input number as a string.
2. Split the string into two digits.
3. Check if either of the digits is equal to 9.
4. Print the appropriate answer.

Using incorrect logic could lead to incorrect results.

Title:
ATCODER p03766 AtCoder Regular Contest 071 - Infinite Sequence

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one error.** The most common bug is to forget to add 1 to the answer when calculating the modulo. For example, if the answer is 100 and the modulo is 101, the correct answer is 100, not 101.
2. **Incorrect modulo operation.** When calculating the modulo, it is important to use the correct operator. For example, in Python, the modulo operator is `%`, not `mod`.
3. **Incorrect use of the factorial function.** The factorial function, `math.factorial(n)`, returns the product of all the integers from 1 to n. For example, `math.factorial(5)` returns 120. It is important to use the factorial function correctly, especially when the input is large.
4. **Incorrect use of the binomial coefficient.** The binomial coefficient, `math.comb(n, k)`, returns the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items. For example, `math.comb(5, 2)` returns 10. It is important to use the binomial coefficient correctly, especially when the input is large.
5. **Incorrect use of the prime factorization.** The prime factorization of a number is the product of all its prime factors. For example, the prime factorization of 120 is 2^3 * 3 * 5. It is important to use the prime factorization correctly, especially when the input is large.
6. **Incorrect use of the Chinese remainder theorem.** The Chinese remainder theorem is a theorem in number theory that allows you to solve a system of congruences. For example, if you have the congruences x ≡ 1 (mod 3), x ≡ 2 (mod 5), and x ≡ 3 (mod 7), the Chinese remainder theorem tells you that x is equal to 13. It is important to use the Chinese remainder theorem correctly, especially when the input is large.
7. **Incorrect use of the extended Euclidean algorithm.** The extended Euclidean algorithm is an algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two integers. For example, the greatest common divisor of 15 and 20 is 5. It is important to use the extended Euclidean algorithm correctly, especially when the input is large.

AIZU p00158 Collatz's Problem

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly handling negative numbers.** The Collatz conjecture only applies to positive integers, so any input that is negative should be handled as an error.
2. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** The Collatz conjecture states that the number of steps required to reach 1 from any positive integer is finite, but there is no known efficient algorithm for computing this number. Some naive algorithms can take an exponential number of steps, so it is important to use a more efficient algorithm.
3. **Not handling overflow.** The Collatz conjecture states that the number of steps required to reach 1 from any positive integer is finite, but the intermediate values can be very large. It is important to use a data type that is large enough to represent these values without overflowing.
4. **Not handling input errors.** The input to the program should be a sequence of positive integers, terminated by a zero. It is important to check for invalid input and handle it gracefully.
5. **Not handling output errors.** The output of the program should be a single integer representing the number of steps required to reach 1 from the input number. It is important to make sure that the output is correct and that it is formatted correctly.

3. The output format is not well-defined. For example, it is not clear whether the output should be a single number or a list of numbers.
4. The program may not handle all possible cases correctly. For example, it may not handle cases where the input data is incomplete or corrupted.
5. The program may be inefficient. For example, it may use a brute-force algorithm that takes a long time to run.

**Solutions**

1. The input format can be defined more clearly by using regular expressions. For example, the following regular expression can be used to match the input format for a single coaster:

```
^C\s+N\s+(\d+)(\s+\d+)*\s*(\d+)\s*(\d+)\s*(\d+)*\s*(\d+)\s*(\d+)*\s*(\d+)\s*(\d+)*$
```

This regular expression matches the first line of the input, which contains the number of coasters and the number of pixels, followed by the rows of pixel data.

2. The input data can be validated to ensure that it contains valid values. For example, the following code can be used to validate the number of coasters and the number of pixels:

```
if int(input()) < 1 or int(input()) > 10000:
    raise ValueError("Number of coasters must be between 1 and 10000")

if int(input()) < 2 or int(input()) > 1000:
    raise ValueError("Number of pixels must be between 2 and 1000")
```

3. The output format can be defined more clearly by using a specific data type. For example, the following code can be used to output the number of coasters that are vertically symmetrical and symmetrical:

```
print(len(list(filter(lambda x: x == 1, [
    coaster_is_vertically_symmetrical(coaster)
    for coaster in coasters
]))))
```

4. The program can be tested to ensure that it handles all possible cases correctly. For example, the following code can be used to test the program on a variety of input data:

```
for _ in range(100):
    coasters = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        coasters.append([int(x) for x in input().split()])

    diffs = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        diffs.append([int(x) for x in input().split()])

    assert len(coasters) == len(diffs) + 1

    for i in range(len(coasters)):
        if i == 0:
            assert is_coaster_vertically_symmetrical(coasters[i])
        else:
            assert is_coaster_vertically_symmetrical(apply_diff(coasters[i - 1], diffs[i - 1]))
```

5. The program can be optimized to improve its performance. For example, the following code can be used to optimize the algorithm for checking whether a coaster is vertically symmetrical:

```
def is_coaster_vertically_symmetrical(coaster):
    n = len(coaster)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        for j in range(n):
            if coaster[i][j] != coaster[n - i - 1][j]:
                return False
    return True
```

This algorithm works by checking whether the pixels in each row of the coaster are symmetrical with the pixels in the corresponding row of the mirrored coaster. This algorithm is much faster than a brute-force algorithm that checks every possible pair of pixels.

AIZU p01348 Cruel Bingo

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain invalid characters, or the numbers may not be in the correct order.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer, which is the number of possible non-bingo patterns with exactly N unmarked squares that can be made from the given initial pattern. The output should be in modulo 10007.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The number of possible non-bingo patterns with exactly N unmarked squares can be calculated by the following formula:

```
C(N^2, N) - C(N^2 - K, N)
```

where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient. However, the developer may make a mistake in the calculation, leading to an incorrect answer.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may forget to add 1 to the answer when calculating the number of possible non-bingo patterns with exactly N unmarked squares. This is because there is one more possible pattern than the number of ways to choose N unmarked squares from N^2 squares.
5. **Memory overflow**. The developer may not allocate enough memory to store the data. This can lead to a segmentation fault or a bus error.
6. **Timeout**. The developer's code may run too long and time out. This can happen if the developer's code is inefficient or if the input is too large.
7. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. This can lead to an incorrect answer.
8. **Incorrect data structure**. The developer may use an incorrect data structure to store the data. This can lead to a slow program or an incorrect answer.
9. **Incorrect implementation**. The developer may implement the algorithm incorrectly. This can lead to a slow program or an incorrect answer.
10. **Incorrect testing**. The developer may not test the program thoroughly. This can lead to bugs that are not caught until the program is deployed in production.

Title:
AIZU p01530 XOR Cloister

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type for the input or output**

The input and output of this problem are both integers. If you use an incorrect data type, such as a string, you will get a type error.

**2. Not initializing variables**

When you declare a variable, you need to initialize it with a value. If you don't initialize a variable, it will contain garbage data, which can lead to errors.

**3. Using the wrong data structure**

The problem statement specifies that the input is a list of lists. If you use a different data structure, such as a dictionary, you will get an error.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement specifies a few constraints on the input data. If you don't handle these edge cases, your code will not work correctly for all inputs.

**5. Making a logic error**

The problem statement is fairly straightforward, but it's still possible to make a logic error. Be careful to check your logic carefully before submitting your code.

**6. Using inefficient algorithms**

The problem statement can be solved in O(N + M) time. If you use an inefficient algorithm, such as a brute-force approach, your code will run slowly.

Title:
AIZU p01686 Magical Switches

Pain points:
**Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs That a Developer May Encounter When Solving This Problem**

1. **Incorrectly identifying the goal of the problem.** The goal of the problem is to move the token to cell $(2, 3M+1)$. A common mistake is to think that the goal is to move the token to cell $(3, 3M+1)$.
2. **Incorrectly identifying the rules of the game.** The rules of the game are as follows:
    * You are allowed to push some of the magical switches ONLY BEFORE you start moving the token.
    * When you push switch $x$, each floor cell painted in color $x$ becomes a wall cell and each wall cell painted in color $x$ becomes a floor cell, simultaneously.
    * You cannot move the token to a wall cell or out of the board.
    * The objective of the game is to move the token to cell $(2, 3M+1)$.
3. **Incorrectly implementing the solution.** A common mistake is to forget to check if the token can reach cell $(2, 3M+1)$ after pushing the switches. Another common mistake is to push the switches in the wrong order.
4. **Incorrectly testing the solution.** A common mistake is to test the solution on a small input that does not contain all of the possible cases. Another common mistake is to test the solution on a random input that does not contain all of the possible cases.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand the goal and the rules of the game.
* Write a detailed solution plan before you start coding.
* Test your solution on a variety of inputs, including small inputs, large inputs, and random inputs.
* Use a debugger to help you find and fix bugs.

AIZU p01830 Delete Files

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly handling the input.** The input may contain invalid characters, such as spaces or newlines. The developer must make sure to check the input for validity and handle any errors appropriately.
2. **Incorrectly deleting files.** The developer must make sure to delete the files that are specified in the input. They must also make sure to delete the files in the correct order, and to avoid deleting files that are not specified in the input.
3. **Memory leaks.** The developer must make sure to free any memory that is allocated during the execution of the program. If memory is not freed, it can eventually lead to a memory leak, which can slow down the program or even cause it to crash.
4. **Synchronization issues.** If multiple threads are accessing the same data, the developer must make sure to synchronize access to the data to avoid race conditions. Race conditions can lead to incorrect results or even to the program crashing.
5. **Security vulnerabilities.** The developer must make sure to protect the program from security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows and SQL injection attacks. Security vulnerabilities can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or to the data that it stores.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may not have 3 lines, or the 2nd line may not have N-1 integers, or the 3rd line may not have N integers.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The input data may not be of the correct data type. For example, the N may not be an integer, or the d_i or g_i may not be an integer.
3. **Off-by-one error.** The developer may accidentally calculate the answer for N-1 houses instead of N houses.
4. **Incorrect algorithm.** The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the developer may use a greedy algorithm that does not always find the optimal solution.
5. **Memory leak.** The developer may not release memory that is no longer needed, which can lead to a memory leak.
6. **Race condition.** The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data, which can lead to a race condition.
7. **Null pointer exception.** The developer may use a null pointer when accessing a data structure, which can lead to a null pointer exception.
8. **Stack overflow.** The developer may create a recursive function that calls itself too many times, which can lead to a stack overflow.
9. **Divide by zero error.** The developer may divide by zero, which can lead to a divide by zero error.
10. **Arithmetic overflow error.** The developer may perform an arithmetic operation that results in an overflow, which can lead to an arithmetic overflow error.

Title:
AIZU p02112 Hating Crowd

Pain points:
**Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs:**

* **Incorrect calculation of congestion degree.** The congestion degree of a date is the maximum influence of any consecutive holiday on that date. This means that the congestion degree of a date may be greater than the influence of any single consecutive holiday. For example, if a date is included in two consecutive holidays with influences of 10 and 20, the congestion degree of that date is 20.
* **Incorrect handling of overlapping consecutive holidays.** Consecutive holidays may overlap, meaning that a date may be included in more than one consecutive holiday. In this case, the influence of the consecutive holidays is added together to calculate the congestion degree of the date. For example, if a date is included in two consecutive holidays with influences of 10 and 20, the congestion degree of that date is 30.
* **Incorrect handling of holidays that span years.** Holidays may span years, meaning that a date may be included in a consecutive holiday that starts in one year and ends in another. In this case, the influence of the consecutive holiday is calculated based on the number of days in the year that the holiday spans. For example, if a consecutive holiday starts on January 1 and ends on December 31, the influence of the holiday is 360.

**Additional Bugs:**

* **Incorrect input validation.** The input should be validated to ensure that it meets the constraints specified in the problem statement. For example, the number of consecutive holidays should be a positive integer, and the dates and durations of the consecutive holidays should be valid.
* **Incorrect output formatting.** The output should be formatted in the specified way. For example, the output should be a single integer on a single line.
* **Incorrect error handling.** The program should handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input is invalid, the program should print an error message and exit.

Title:
AIZU p02252 Fractional Knapsack Problem

Pain points:
**1. Overflow**

The input values can be very large, so it is important to be careful about overflow. For example, if you multiply two integers that are both larger than `INT_MAX`, the result will be negative.

**2. Floating-point errors**

The output must not contain an error greater than `10^-6`. This means that you need to use floating-point arithmetic when computing the maximum total value.

**3. Incorrect sorting**

The items need to be sorted by their `v / w` ratio in descending order. If the items are not sorted correctly, the maximum total value may not be found.

**4. Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm**

The greedy algorithm for the fractional knapsack problem works by iteratively adding the item with the highest `v / w` ratio to the knapsack until the capacity is reached. However, it is important to check that the item can actually be added to the knapsack before adding it.

**5. Incorrect calculation of the maximum total value**

The maximum total value is the sum of the values of the items that are added to the knapsack. However, it is important to round the values to the nearest 10^-6 before adding them.

Title:
AIZU p02400 Circle

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect calculation of the area or circumference of a circle.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. To avoid this mistake, be sure to use the correct formula for calculating the area and circumference of a circle.
2. **Incorrect input or output of the radius.** The radius of a circle must be a positive number greater than 0. Be sure to check the input for errors and to output the radius in the correct format.
3. **Floating-point rounding errors.** When calculating the area and circumference of a circle, it is important to use floating-point arithmetic. However, floating-point arithmetic can introduce rounding errors, which can cause the output to be incorrect. To avoid this problem, be sure to use the `round()` function to round the output to the desired precision.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over the values of a range, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. This can cause the program to skip or repeat a value, which will result in an incorrect output. To avoid this problem, be sure to check the bounds of the range carefully.
5. **Incorrect use of the `math` library.** The `math` library contains a number of functions that can be used to calculate the area and circumference of a circle. However, it is important to use these functions correctly. For example, the `pi()` function returns the value of pi, which is not the same as the area or circumference of a circle.
6. **Incorrect use of the `print()` function.** The `print()` function can be used to output the results of a program. However, it is important to use this function correctly. For example, be sure to include a newline character at the end of the output.
