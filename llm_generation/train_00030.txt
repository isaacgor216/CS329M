CODECHEF anuarm

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the input or output.** The input and output of this problem are both lists of integers. If the developer uses the wrong data type, the program will not work correctly.
2. **Not handling the edge cases correctly.** The problem states that `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5` and `1 ≤ M ≤ 10^5`. If the developer does not handle these edge cases correctly, the program will not work correctly for large values of N and M.
3. **Using incorrect logic.** The logic used to solve this problem is relatively straightforward. However, if the developer makes a mistake in their logic, the program will not work correctly.
4. **Not using efficient algorithms.** The problem can be solved in O(N + M) time using a simple algorithm. However, if the developer uses a less efficient algorithm, the program will run slower than necessary.
5. **Not testing the code thoroughly.** It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly for all possible inputs. If the developer does not test the code thoroughly, the program may contain bugs that will not be caught until it is deployed to production.

Pain points:
**Possible Problems and Bugs:**

* The input format is not clear. It is not clear how to parse the input into an array of integers.
* The output format is not clear. It is not clear how to represent the number of times Dexter has to repeat the step.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if there are multiple ways to select A or B.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the number of idlis is not evenly divisible by 2.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input is invalid.
* The code is not efficient. It takes O(n^2) time to run, where n is the number of students.
* The code is not memory efficient. It uses O(n) space, where n is the number of students.

Here are some possible solutions to these problems:

* To parse the input into an array of integers, you can use the `split()` method on the string. For example, the following code would parse the input into an array of integers:

```
arr = input().split()
for i in range(len(arr)):
    arr[i] = int(arr[i])
```

* To represent the number of times Dexter has to repeat the step, you can use the `print()` function. For example, the following code would print the number of times Dexter has to repeat the step:

```
print(num_steps)
```

* To handle the case where there are multiple ways to select A or B, you can randomly select one of the ways. For example, the following code would randomly select one of the ways to select A:

```
random_index = random.randint(0, len(arr) - 1)
A = arr[random_index]
```

* To handle the case where the number of idlis is not evenly divisible by 2, you can round the number of idlis up to the nearest even number. For example, the following code would round the number of idlis up to the nearest even number:

```
num_idlis = int(num_idlis + 0.5)
```

* To handle the case where the input is invalid, you can raise an exception. For example, the following code would raise an exception if the number of students is less than 1:

```
if num_students < 1:
    raise ValueError("The number of students must be at least 1.")
```

* To improve the efficiency of the code, you can use a binary search to find the maximum and minimum number of idlis. For example, the following code would use a binary search to find the maximum number of idlis:

```
max_idli = arr[0]
for i in range(1, len(arr)):
    if arr[i] > max_idli:
        max_idli = arr[i]
```

* To improve the memory efficiency of the code, you can use a list comprehension to create the array of integers. For example, the following code would create the array of integers using a list comprehension:

```
arr = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
```

Title:
CODECHEF pairclst

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is given as a string, but the developer may mistakenly parse it as an integer. This would result in incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to find the shortest pairwise distance between any two different special nodes. This would also result in incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may make an off-by-one error when calculating the shortest pairwise distance between any two different special nodes. This would also result in incorrect results.
4. **Memory leak**. The developer may not free up memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
5. **Infinite loop**. The developer may create an infinite loop in their code. This can prevent the program from terminating, which can also cause the program to crash.
6. **Incorrect output format**. The developer may output the results in the wrong format. This can make it difficult for the user to understand the results.
7. **Incorrect error handling**. The developer may not handle errors correctly. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
8. **Security vulnerability**. The developer may introduce a security vulnerability in their code. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the program or the data it is processing.

Title:
CODECHEF sque1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of loops**. The most common mistake is to use the wrong type of loop. For example, you might try to use a for loop to iterate over a list of strings, but this will not work because a for loop iterates over the elements of a list, not the list itself.
2. **Incorrect use of conditions**. Another common mistake is to use the wrong type of condition. For example, you might try to use an equality comparison to check if a string contains a certain character, but this will not work because an equality comparison will only return true if the two strings are exactly the same.
3. **Incorrect use of functions**. The third most common mistake is to use the wrong function. For example, you might try to use the `len()` function to get the number of characters in a string, but this will not work because the `len()` function only works on lists, not strings.
4. **Incorrect use of data types**. The fourth most common mistake is to use the wrong data type. For example, you might try to store a number in a string variable, but this will not work because strings cannot store numbers.
5. **Incorrect indentation**. The fifth most common mistake is to have incorrect indentation. This can cause your code to be difficult to read and understand, and it can also lead to errors.
6. **Uncaught exceptions**. The sixth most common mistake is to not handle exceptions. This can cause your code to crash unexpectedly, which can be very frustrating for users.
7. **Memory leaks**. The seventh most common mistake is to create memory leaks. This can cause your program to use up more and more memory, eventually leading to a crash.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. The eighth most common mistake is to create security vulnerabilities. This can allow attackers to access your data or take control of your system.
9. **Incorrect use of libraries**. The ninth most common mistake is to use libraries incorrectly. This can cause your code to be slow, buggy, or insecure.
10. **Poor design**. The tenth most common mistake is to have poor design. This can make your code difficult to read, understand, and maintain.

4. **Incorrect logic**. The program may not be able to solve the problem correctly due to incorrect logic. For example, the program may not be able to handle all possible cases.
5. **Infinite loop**. The program may enter an infinite loop, which will prevent it from terminating. This can happen if the program contains a logical error or if the input is malformed.
6. **Memory leak**. The program may not release memory that it has allocated, which can lead to a memory leak. This can eventually cause the program to crash.
7. **Security vulnerability**. The program may contain a security vulnerability, which can allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system. For example, the program may not properly validate user input, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the program.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1073_E. Segment Sum

Pain points:
```
1. **Incorrect modulo operation.** When calculating the sum of numbers, it is important to use the modulo operator correctly. For example, if you are calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to 10, and you want to find the remainder when dividing by 10, you would need to use the following code:

```
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 11):
    sum += i
print(sum % 10)
```

2. **Off-by-one errors.** When working with numbers, it is easy to make off-by-one errors. For example, if you are calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to 10, and you forget to include the number 10 in the sum, you will get the wrong answer.

3. **Incorrect use of mathematical functions.** When using mathematical functions, it is important to make sure that you are using them correctly. For example, if you are calculating the square root of a number, you need to make sure that the number is positive.

4. **Incorrect variable initialization.** When initializing variables, it is important to make sure that you initialize them with the correct values. For example, if you are initializing a variable to store the sum of numbers, you need to make sure that you initialize it to 0.

5. **Incorrect use of loops.** When using loops, it is important to make sure that you are using them correctly. For example, if you are looping through a list of numbers, you need to make sure that you increment the loop variable correctly.

6. **Incorrect use of conditions.** When using conditions, it is important to make sure that you are using them correctly. For example, if you are checking if a number is divisible by 2, you need to make sure that you are using the correct operator.

7. **Incorrect use of functions.** When using functions, it is important to make sure that you are using them correctly. For example, if you are calling a function to calculate the factorial of a number, you need to make sure that you pass the correct number to the function.

8. **Incorrect use of data structures.** When using data structures, it is important to make sure that you are using them correctly. For example, if you are using a list to store a list of numbers, you need to make sure that you are adding the numbers to the list correctly.

9. **Incorrect use of file I/O.** When using file I/O, it is important to make sure that you are using it correctly. For example, if you are opening a file to read data, you need to make sure that you close the file after you are finished reading the data.

10. **Incorrect use of exceptions.** When using exceptions, it is important to make sure that you are using them correctly. For example, if you are trying to open a file that does not exist, you need to make sure that you handle the exception correctly.

**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined. For example, the input ```1``` ```)``` is not valid.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output should be a single integer.

**3. Incorrect solution**

The solution may not be correct. For example, the following solution is incorrect:

```
n = int(input())
s = input()
count = 0
for i in range(n):
    if s[i] == '(':
        count += 1
    else:
        count -= 1

```

This solution will not work for inputs such as ```(())```.

**4. Runtime error**

The solution may not run within the time limit. For example, the following solution will time out on large inputs:

```
n = int(input())
s = input()
count = 0

CODEFORCES 1114_F. Please, another Queries on Array?

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of Euler's totient function.** The Euler's totient function is defined as $\varphi(n) = n \prod_{p \mid n} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{p} \right)$, where $p$ is a prime number that divides $n$. A common mistake is to forget the product over all prime factors of $n$, which can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect handling of queries.** The problem statement specifies that queries must be processed in the order they are given. A common mistake is to process queries out of order, which can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic.** The problem statement specifies that the output must be modulo $10^9+7$. A common mistake is to forget to perform modulo arithmetic when computing the answer to a query, which can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Runtime errors.** The problem statement specifies that the solution must run in time $O(n \log n)$. A common mistake is to write a solution that runs in time $O(n^2)$ or worse, which will result in a time limit exceeded error.
5. **Memory errors.** The problem statement specifies that the solution must use at most $256$ MB of memory. A common mistake is to write a solution that uses more memory than this, which will result in a memory limit exceeded error.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements. It is also important to test your solution thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and runs within the time and memory limits.

CODEFORCES 1183_H. Subsequences (hard version)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is given as two integers and a string. The developer may mistakenly read the input data as a string, a list, or a tuple. This will lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. This could lead to incorrect results or timeouts.
3. **Incorrect implementation**. The developer may make mistakes in the implementation of the algorithm. This could lead to incorrect results or runtime errors.
4. **Incorrect testing**. The developer may not test the code thoroughly enough. This could lead to bugs that are not caught until the code is deployed in production.
5. **Incorrect deployment**. The developer may not deploy the code correctly. This could lead to the code being unavailable to users or to the code being deployed in an incorrect environment.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer may incorrectly read the input data as a string, a list, or a tuple. This could lead to incorrect results, such as the following:

```
>>> n, k = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
>>> s = input()
>>> print(k - len(s))
-1
```

* The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. This could lead to incorrect results or timeouts, such as the following:

```
def get_min_cost(n, k, s):
    costs = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):

    return min(costs)


n, k = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
s = input()
print(get_min_cost(n, k, s))
```

* The developer may make mistakes in the implementation of the algorithm. This could lead to incorrect results or runtime errors, such as the following:

```
def get_min_cost(n, k, s):
    costs = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            costs.append(n - j)
    return min(costs)


n, k = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
s = input()
print(get_min_cost(n, k, s))
```

* The developer may not test the code thoroughly enough. This could lead to bugs that are not caught until the code is deployed in production, such as the following:

```
def get_min_cost(n, k, s):
    costs = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            costs.append(n - j)
    return min(costs)


n, k = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
s = input()
print(get_min_cost(n, k, s))
```

* The developer may not deploy the code correctly. This could lead to the code being unavailable to users or to the code being deployed in an incorrect environment, such as the following:

```
def get_min_cost(n, k, s):
    costs = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            costs.append(n - j)
    return min(costs)

CODEFORCES 1201_C. Maximum Median

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect sorting algorithm.** The median of an array is the middle element after the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. If the array is not sorted correctly, the median will be incorrect.
2. **Inefficient algorithm.** There are more efficient algorithms to find the median of an array than sorting the entire array.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** A small mistake in the implementation of the algorithm can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Memory errors.** If the array is too large, it may not fit in memory. This can cause the program to crash or give incorrect results.
5. **Timeout errors.** If the algorithm takes too long to run, it may time out. This can also cause the program to crash or give incorrect results.
6. **Incorrect input.** The input data may be incorrect. This can cause the program to crash or give incorrect results.
7. **Incorrect output.** The output data may be incorrect. This can cause the program to crash or give incorrect results.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design and implement the algorithm, and to test it thoroughly with a variety of input data.
Test inputs:
```
# 1. Incorrect sorting algorithm

CODEFORCES 1219_B. Xor Spanning Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly computing the minimum cost.** The minimum cost is the sum of the costs of the cheapest wormholes that connect all planets to the capital. A common mistake is to only consider the costs of the wormholes that are directly connected to the capital. However, it is possible that there is a cheaper way to connect all planets to the capital by first repairing a wormhole that is not directly connected to the capital.
2. **Incorrectly computing the number of valid reparations.** The number of valid reparations is the number of ways to choose a subset of the wormholes such that the sum of the costs of the wormholes in the subset is the minimum cost. A common mistake is to only consider the subsets of wormholes that include all of the wormholes that are directly connected to the capital. However, it is possible that there is a cheaper way to connect all planets to the capital by not repairing some of the wormholes that are directly connected to the capital.
3. **Using an incorrect modulo operation.** The output should be modulo 1000000007. A common mistake is to use the modulo operation incorrectly, for example by using `%` instead of `%mod`.
4. **Using an incorrect data type.** The input and output should be integers. A common mistake is to use a floating-point data type for the input or output.
5. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. A common mistake is to use a brute-force algorithm, which will be much slower.

## 1. Incorrect input format

The input format for this problem is not very well-defined. It is not clear what the exact format of the queries is, and it is possible to make mistakes when parsing the input. For example, if the input contains a query with a negative value for `c`, the program will crash.

## 2. Incorrect output format

The output format for this problem is also not very well-defined. It is not clear how many digits the output should have, and it is possible to make mistakes when formatting the output. For example, if the output contains a number with more digits than necessary, the program will produce incorrect output.

## 3. Incorrect calculation of the number of connected components

The most important part of this problem is to correctly calculate the number of connected components in the matrix. There are a few ways to do this, but the most efficient way is to use a union-find data structure. A union-find data structure is a data structure that can be used to track the connected components of a graph. It works by maintaining a set of disjoint sets, and when two elements are connected, they are merged into the same set.

To use a union-find data structure to solve this problem, we first need to create a set of disjoint sets, one for each cell in the matrix. We then need to iterate over the queries, and for each query, we need to update the union-find data structure to reflect the new connections. Finally, we need to iterate over the union-find data structure to count the number of connected components.

## 4. Memory leaks

It is important to be careful not to create any memory leaks when solving
Test inputs:
1. Incorrect input format

```
3 2 10
2 1 -1
1 2 1
2 2 1
```

This input is incorrect because the value of `c` in the second query is negative. The program should crash when it tries to parse this input.

2. Incorrect output format

```
3 2 4 3 4 4 4 2 2 4
```

This output is incorrect because it contains a number with more digits than necessary. The correct output should be:

```
3
4
3
3
4
4
4
2
2
4
```

3. Incorrect calculation of the number of connected components

```
3 2 10
2 1 1
1 2 1
2 2 1
```

This input should produce the output:

```
2
4
3
```

However, the program produces the output:

```
3
3
3
```

This is because the program does not correctly update the union-find data structure when two elements are connected.

4. Memory leaks

```
3 2 10
2 1 1
1 2 1
2 2 1
```

This input should not produce any memory leaks. However, the program does produce a memory leak because it does not free the memory allocated for the `matrix` and `par` arrays.
Title:
CODEFORCES 1327_G. Letters and Question Marks

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for storing the frequencies of the characters in the input string.** This can lead to incorrect results, as the frequencies will be rounded to the nearest integer value. For example, if the frequency of a character is 3.5, it will be rounded to 4, which could result in a loss of accuracy.

**2. Not handling the case where there are more question marks in the input string than there are unique characters in the alphabet.** In this case, it is not possible to replace all of the question marks with unique characters, and the maximum value of the string will be 0.

**3. Not taking into account the cost of each string in the array.** The value of the string is calculated as the sum of the costs of each string in the array multiplied by the number of occurrences of that string in the input string. If the costs of the strings are not taken into account, the maximum value of the string may not be optimal.

**4. Using a brute-force approach to find the maximum value of the string.** This can be very time-consuming, especially for large input strings. There are more efficient algorithms that can be used to find the maximum value of the string.

**5. Not handling the case where the input string is empty.** In this case, the maximum value of the string is 0.

**6. Not handling the case where the input string contains invalid characters.** This can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input string contains a character that is not in the alphabet, the program may crash.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input contains a non-integer value, the program may not be able to parse it correctly.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values may not be correct, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a string value where an integer value is expected, the program may not be able to convert the string to an integer correctly.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The program may miss or add one or more elements when iterating over a list or array. This can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program is supposed to count the number of elements in a list, but it misses one element, the count will be incorrect.
4. **Index out of bounds error**. The program may try to access an element of a list or array that does not exist. This can lead to a crash or an incorrect result. For example, if the program tries to access the 10th element of a list that only has 9 elements, the program will crash.
5. **Null pointer exception**. The program may try to access a null pointer, which will cause a crash. For example, if the program tries to dereference a variable that has not been initialized, the program will throw a null pointer exception.
6. **Arithmetic overflow**. The program may perform an arithmetic operation that results in an overflow, which will cause the program to crash. For example, if the program tries to divide a number by zero, the program will crash.
7. **Race condition**. The program may not be thread-safe, which can lead to incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time. For example, if two threads are trying to update the same variable at the same time, the results may be incorrect.
8. **Deadlock**. The program may enter a deadlock state, which means that no thread can make progress. This can happen when two threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, but neither thread can do so because the other thread is waiting for it.
9. **Memory leak**. The program may not release memory that it is no longer using, which can lead to a memory leak. This can eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
10. **Security vulnerability**. The program may contain a security vulnerability, such as a buffer overflow or a SQL injection vulnerability. This can allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the program or the system.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the number should not have any leading zeroes. However, a developer may accidentally read a number with leading zeroes, which will lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the sum of the two numbers**. The sum of the two numbers should be calculated as `a + b`, where `a` and `b` are the two permutations of the digits of `n`. However, a developer may accidentally calculate the sum as `a * b`, which will lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output should print two permutations of the digits of `n`, such that the sum of these numbers ends with the maximum number of zeroes. However, a developer may accidentally print the two permutations in the wrong order, or may print them with leading zeroes, which will lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. The input may contain a number with zero digits, or a number with only one digit. A developer must handle these edge cases correctly, or the program will crash or produce incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect use of data structures**. The program must use data structures such as arrays and linked lists to store the digits of the two numbers and the sum of the two numbers. A developer must use these data structures correctly, or the program will crash or produce incorrect results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1505_G. Encoded message

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer N, and the next N lines should contain 5 space-separated integers each. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to process the input correctly and will likely produce an incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the sum of the first three integers and the sum of the last two integers.** The sum of the first three integers must be equal to the sum of the last two integers. If the sum of the first three integers is not equal to the sum of the last two integers, the program will not be able to decode the message correctly and will likely produce an incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect decoding of the message.** The message is encoded using a simple substitution cipher. The first three letters of the alphabet (a, b, and c) are encoded as 0, 1, and 2, respectively. The last three letters of the alphabet (d, e, and f) are encoded as 3, 4, and 5, respectively. If the message is not decoded correctly, the output will not be a valid English string.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a string of lowercase English letters. If the output is not in the correct format, it will not be accepted by the judge.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the program thoroughly with a variety of input values to ensure that it is working correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1529_A. Eshag Loves Big Arrays

Pain points:
* **Incorrect input format**. The input format may not be correctly parsed by the program, resulting in incorrect output. For example, if the input is `1
2` instead of `1
2 3`, the program may think that there is only one element in the array, and output `0` instead of `1`.
* **Incorrect output format**. The output format may not be correctly formatted by the program, resulting in incorrect output. For example, if the output is `123`, the program may think that the output is an integer, and output `123` instead of `3`.
* **Incorrect algorithm**. The program may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem, resulting in incorrect output. For example, the following algorithm is incorrect:

```
def solve(a):
  # Find the maximum element in the array.
  max_element = max(a)

  # Iterate over all elements in the array, and delete any element that is larger than the maximum element.
  for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] > max_element:
      a[i] = 0

  # Return the number of elements that were deleted.
  return sum(a)
```

This algorithm will not work correctly if the array contains duplicate elements. For example, if the input is `[1, 1, 2]`, the algorithm will delete both of the `1`s, even though only one of them is larger than the maximum element.
* **Incorrect data type**. The program may use the wrong data type to store the input data, resulting in incorrect output. For example, if the input is a list of integers, the program may store the input as a list of strings, and then try to perform mathematical operations on the strings, resulting in incorrect output.
* **Off-by-one errors**. The program may make off-by-one errors when indexing into the array, resulting in incorrect output. For example, if the input is `[1, 2, 3]`, the program may try to access the element at index `3`, which does not exist, resulting in an error.
* **Memory leaks**. The program may not properly release memory that it has allocated, resulting in a memory leak. This can cause the program to slow down or crash.
* **Race conditions**. The program may not be thread-safe, resulting in incorrect output if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.
* **Deadlocks**. The program may deadlock if multiple threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, resulting in the program being unable to continue.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program's execution. For example, if the output contains a string instead of a number, the program may crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program may contain errors in its logic, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may not take into account all of the input data, or it may make incorrect assumptions about the data.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. These errors occur when the program misses or adds one element when iterating through a list or array. This can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Indexing errors**. These errors occur when the program accesses an element of a list or array that is out of bounds. This can lead to errors or crashes.
6. **Null pointer exceptions**. These errors occur when the program attempts to access a null pointer. This can lead to errors or crashes.
7. **Arithmetic errors**. These errors occur when the program performs an arithmetic operation incorrectly. This can lead to incorrect results.
8. **Memory leaks**. These errors occur when the program does not release memory that it is no longer using. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
9. **Race conditions**. These errors occur when two or more parts of the program try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or crashes.
10. **Deadlocks**. These errors occur when two or more parts of the program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish because it is waiting for the other. This can lead to the program running indefinitely or crashing.

However, if the frequencies of the characters are not tracked correctly, the number of balanced strings may be incorrect.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** The number of balanced strings may be incorrect if the frequencies of the characters are calculated incorrectly. For example, if the string "abc" is balanced, then the frequencies of the characters a, b, and c should be 1, 1, and 1, respectively. However, if the frequencies of the characters are calculated incorrectly, the number of balanced strings may be incorrect.

CODEFORCES 322_B. Ciel and Flowers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable types**. The problem states that `r, g, b` are integers, but the code below uses `float`s. This will cause the program to crash when it tries to divide `r` by `3`.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The problem states that Fox Ciel can make `r // 3` red bouquets, but the code below only makes `r / 3`. This will cause the program to underestimate the number of bouquets that Fox Ciel can make.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The problem states that Fox Ciel can make `g // 3` green bouquets, but the code below makes `g // 3 + 1`. This will cause the program to overestimate the number of bouquets that Fox Ciel can make.
4. **Unnecessary variables**. The code below uses the variable `i` to iterate over the values of `r`, `g`, and `b`, but this is unnecessary. The program could simply use the `range()` function to iterate over the values of `r`, `g`, and `b`.
5. **Redundant code**. The code below contains two separate loops to calculate the number of red and green bouquets that Fox Ciel can make. This is redundant, as the same code could be used to calculate the number of both red and green bouquets.
6. **Inefficient code**. The code below uses a `for` loop to iterate over the values of `r`, `g`, and `b`, but this is inefficient. The program could use the `sum()` function to calculate the total number of flowers that Fox Ciel has, and then divide this number by 3 to calculate the number of bouquets that she can make.

Here is a corrected version of the code that solves the problem correctly:

```python
r, g, b = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the number of red bouquets that Fox Ciel can make.
red_bouquets = r // 3

# Calculate the number of green bouquets that Fox Ciel can make.
green_bouquets = g // 3

# Calculate the number of blue bouquets that Fox Ciel can make.
blue_bouquets = b // 3

# Calculate the number of mixing bouquets that Fox Ciel can make.
mixing_bouquets = min(r, g, b) // 3

# Calculate the total number of bouquets that Fox Ciel can make.
total_bouquets = red_bouquets + green_bouquets + blue_bouquets + mixing_bouquets

# Print the total number of bouquets.
print(total_bouquets)

CODEFORCES 346_E. Doodle Jump

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulo operation.** The modulo operation is often used in this problem, so it is important to make sure that you are using it correctly. For example, if you are trying to find the remainder of `a` divided by `p`, you should use the following formula: `a % p`.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** It is easy to make off-by-one errors when you are working with modulo arithmetic. For example, if you are trying to find the largest multiple of `p` that is less than `n`, you should use the following formula: `n - n % p`.
3. **Incorrect array indexing.** It is important to make sure that you are indexing arrays correctly. For example, if you are trying to access the element at index `i` of an array, you should use the following syntax: `array[i]`.
4. **Incorrect variable declaration.** It is important to make sure that you are declaring variables correctly. For example, if you are trying to declare a variable of type `int`, you should use the following syntax: `int x;`.
5. **Incorrect typecasting.** It is important to make sure that you are typecasting correctly. For example, if you are trying to cast a `double` to an `int`, you should use the following syntax: `(int) x`.
6. **Uninitialized variables.** It is important to initialize variables before you use them. For example, if you are trying to use a variable without initializing it, you will get a compiler error.
7. **Unused variables.** It is important to use all of the variables that you declare. For example, if you declare a variable and then never use it, you will get a compiler warning.
8. **Memory leaks.** It is important to free up memory that you have allocated. For example, if you allocate memory using the `malloc` function, you should free it up using the `free` function.

CODEFORCES 370_A. Rook, Bishop and King

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be four integers separated by spaces, but the developer may accidentally use a different delimiter, such as a comma or a tab. This will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect row or column numbers.** The rows and columns of the chessboard are numbered from 1 to 8, but the developer may accidentally use numbers outside of this range. This will cause the program to crash.
3. **Incorrect chess piece movement.** The rook can only move horizontally or vertically, the bishop can only move diagonally, and the king can move one field in any direction. The developer may accidentally move a piece in a way that is not allowed by the rules of chess. This will cause the program to output incorrect results.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the number of moves required to move a piece from one square to another, the developer may accidentally make an off-by-one error. This will cause the program to output incorrect results.
5. **Memory errors.** If the developer does not allocate enough memory for the program to run, the program may crash.
6. **Logic errors.** The developer may make a logical error in the code, such as using the wrong variable or forgetting to check a condition. This will cause the program to output incorrect results or crash.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input format, the row and column numbers, the chess piece movements, and the logic of the program. They should also use a debugger to track down any errors that may occur.

CODEFORCES 391_F1. Stock Trading

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrectly calculating the maximum profit.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. The key to getting the correct answer is to carefully track the maximum profit that can be achieved at each point in time. This can be done by maintaining a running total of the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling at each price.
2. **Not taking into account the constraints on the number of trades that can be made.** The problem states that Manao is only allowed to make a maximum of k buy orders over the next n days. This means that it is possible for the optimal solution to involve not making any trades at all. Developers need to be careful to check if the constraints on the number of trades allow for a profitable solution.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. The most efficient algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that takes O(n^2) time to run. Developers should be careful to choose an algorithm that is appropriate for the size of the input data.
4. **Making a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm.** Even if the developer chooses the correct algorithm, they still need to implement it correctly. This can be a difficult task, especially for more complex algorithms. Developers should carefully test their implementation to make sure that it is correct.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that developers may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly calculating the maximum profit.** A common mistake is to only consider the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling at the current price. However, it is also possible to make a profit by buying at a lower price and selling at a higher price. Developers need to make sure to take into account all possible ways to make a profit when calculating the maximum profit.
* **Not taking into account the constraints on the number of trades that can be made.** Another common mistake is to only consider the maximum profit that can be achieved by making a single trade. However, it is possible for the optimal solution to involve making multiple trades. Developers need to make sure to check if the constraints on the number of trades allow for a profitable solution.
* **Using an incorrect algorithm.** A common mistake is to use an algorithm that is too slow for the size of the input data. For example, a brute-force algorithm that checks every possible combination of trades will take O(n^k) time to run, where n is the number of days and k is the number of trades. Developers should choose an algorithm that is appropriate for the size of the input data.
* **Making a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm.** Even if the developer chooses the correct algorithm, they still need to implement it correctly. This can be a difficult task, especially for more complex algorithms. Developers should carefully test their implementation to make sure that it is correct.

CODEFORCES 414_D. Mashmokh and Water Tanks

Pain points:
**Possible problems:**

* The input format is not clear. What does "space-separated" mean? Does it mean that there is a single space between each integer? Or can there be multiple spaces between integers?
* The output format is not clear. Does it mean that we should print a single integer? Or can we print multiple integers?
* The problem statement is not clear. What does it mean to "pour into each of them exactly 1 liter of water"? Does it mean that we should pour 1 liter of water into each tank, or does it mean that we should pour 1 liter of water into each vertex?
* The problem statement is not clear. What does it mean to "move all the water from the tank of vertex xi to the tank of its father"? Does it mean that we should move all the water from vertex xi to its parent vertex? Or does it mean that we should move all the water from vertex xi to the vertex that is connected to vertex xi by an edge?
* The problem statement is not clear. What does it mean to "Mashmokh will win max(w1, w2, ..., wl) dollars"? Does it mean that Mashmokh will win the maximum amount of money that he can win by playing the game? Or does it mean that Mashmokh will win the maximum amount of money that he can win by playing the game, given the constraints on the number of liters of water and the number of coins?
* The problem statement is not clear. What does it mean to "the vertices from this list should be considered one by one in the order"? Does it mean that we should consider the vertices in the order that they are listed in the input? Or does it mean that we should consider the vertices in the order that they appear in the tree?
* The problem statement is not clear. What does it mean to "if its door is closed then skip the vertex else move all the water from the tank of vertex xi to the tank of its father"? Does it mean that we should skip the vertex if its door is closed, or does it mean that we should move all the water from the tank of vertex xi to the tank of its father, even if its door is closed?
* The problem statement is not clear. What does it mean to "Mashmokh wanted to know what is the maximum amount of dollars he can win by playing the above game"? Does it mean that Mashmokh wants to know the maximum amount of money that he can win by playing the game, given the constraints on the number of liters of water and the number of coins? Or does it mean that Mashmokh wants to know the maximum amount of money that he can win by playing the game, given the constraints on the number of liters of water, the number of coins, and the order in which the vertices are considered?

**Possible bugs:**

CODEFORCES 510_A. Fox And Snake

Pain points:
The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are as follows:

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specified in the problem statement is very specific. If the input format is not followed correctly, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of snake body length**. The snake body length is calculated by multiplying the number of rows by the number of columns in the table. If this calculation is incorrect, the snake will not be drawn correctly.
3. **Incorrect drawing of the snake**. The snake is drawn by printing a '#' character for each cell in the snake body and a '.' character for each cell that is not in the snake body. If this is not done correctly, the snake will not be drawn correctly.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specified in the problem statement is very specific. If the output format is not followed correctly, the program will not be able to correctly output the solution and will likely receive a negative score.

By following the tips below, you can help to avoid these common problems and bugs:

1. **Be sure to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats.**
2. **Test your program with a variety of input values to ensure that it is working correctly.**
3. **Use a debugger to help you identify and fix any errors in your program.**
4. **Consult with a mentor or other experienced programmer if you are having trouble solving the problem.**

**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly. For example, if you are using `scanf` to read the input, you need to make sure that you are using the correct format specifiers.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem is also very specific. It is important to make sure that you are formatting your output correctly. For example, you need to make sure that you are using the correct modulus operator and that you are not printing any extra characters.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

This problem is very prone to off-by-one errors. For example, you might accidentally forget to add one to the length of a string when you are computing the number of half-occurrences.

**4. Incorrect data structures**

You need to use the correct data structures to solve this problem. For example, you might want to use a hash table to store the substrings of the string `s`.

**5. Incorrect algorithms**

The algorithm that you use to solve this problem is very important. You need to make sure that your algorithm is correct and efficient. For example, you might want to use a dynamic programming algorithm to solve this problem.

**6. Incorrect implementation**

Even if you have a correct algorithm, you still need to implement it correctly. For example, you might make a mistake in your code when you are computing the number of half-occurrences.

**7. Incorrect test cases**

CODEFORCES 608_A. Saitama Destroys Hotel

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to unexpected results. For example, if the first line of input is `3 7 2 1`, the program will crash because it expects two integers, but it only receives one.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed, which may lead to unexpected results. For example, if the output is `11 2`, the program will crash because it expects a single integer, but it receives two integers.
3. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input and output is not strictly followed, which may lead to unexpected results. For example, if the input is `3 7` and the output is `11`, the program will crash because it expects integers, but it receives a float.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The program may make an off-by-one error, which means that it either misses one element or includes one extra element. For example, if the input is `3 7` and the output is `10`, the program has made an off-by-one error because it missed the element `2`.
5. **Infinite loop**. The program may enter an infinite loop, which means that it will never stop running. For example, if the input is `0 0` and the output is `0`, the program has entered an infinite loop because it will always wait for a passenger to arrive.
6. **Memory leak**. The program may leak memory, which means that it will use up more and more memory until it eventually crashes. For example, if the program uses a global variable to store the data, it will leak memory every time the program is run.
7. **Security vulnerability**. The program may have a security vulnerability, which means that it can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system. For example, if the program allows users to input arbitrary data, it could be exploited by attackers to inject malicious code into the system.
8. **Incorrect algorithm**. The program may use an incorrect algorithm, which means that it will not produce the correct results. For example, if the program uses a bubble sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers, it will not produce the correct results if the list is already sorted.

6. **Incorrect handling of parallel edges.** The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can be used to compute the shortest paths in a graph with parallel edges. However, it is important to handle parallel edges correctly, as a small mistake can lead to incorrect results.
7. **Incorrect handling of negative cycles.** The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can be used to compute the shortest paths in a graph with negative cycles. However, it is important to handle negative cycles correctly, as a small mistake can lead to incorrect results.

**Solutions**

1. To avoid incorrect implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, it is important to carefully read the algorithm's pseudocode and understand how it works. It is also important to test the algorithm on a variety of graphs, including graphs with negative weights, disconnected graphs, and graphs with duplicate edges, self-loops, parallel edges, and negative cycles.
2. To avoid incorrect handling of negative weights, it is important to remember that the shortest path between two vertices in a graph with negative weights may not be unique. It is also important to remember that the shortest path between two vertices in a graph with negative weights may not exist.
3. To avoid incorrect handling of disconnected graphs, it is important to remember that the Floyd-Warshall algorithm cannot be used to compute the shortest paths in a disconnected graph.
4. To avoid incorrect handling of duplicate edges, it is important to remember that the Floyd-Warshall algorithm will only consider the shortest duplicate edge when computing the shortest path between two vertices.
5. To avoid incorrect handling of self-loops, it is important to remember that the Floyd-Warshall algorithm will treat a self-loop as a zero-weight edge.
6. To avoid incorrect handling of parallel edges, it is important to remember that the Floyd-Warshall algorithm will only consider the shortest parallel edge when computing the shortest path between two vertices.
7. To avoid incorrect handling of negative cycles, it is important to remember that the Floyd-Warshall algorithm cannot be used to compute the shortest paths in a graph with negative cycles.

Title:
CODEFORCES 653_F. Paper task

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of substrings.** The problem statement says that we need to count the number of non-empty correct sequences that occur in a string s as a substring, but some solutions incorrectly count the number of subsequences.
2. **Incorrect use of parentheses.** The problem statement says that we need to consider only strings consisting of opening and closing round brackets, but some solutions incorrectly consider strings with other characters.
3. **Incorrect use of the stack data structure.** The stack data structure is a useful tool for solving this problem, but some solutions incorrectly use the stack. For example, some solutions push the opening parentheses onto the stack but then forget to pop them when they see a closing parenthesis.
4. **Incorrect use of the recursion function.** The recursion function is a powerful tool for solving this problem, but some solutions incorrectly use the recursion function. For example, some solutions call the recursion function on a substring that is not a correct sequence of brackets.
5. **Incorrect use of the brute force approach.** The brute force approach is a simple but inefficient way to solve this problem, but some solutions incorrectly use the brute force approach. For example, some solutions iterate over all possible substrings of the input string, even though many of these substrings are not correct sequences of brackets.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Make sure you understand the problem statement carefully.
* Use the stack data structure correctly.
* Use the recursion function correctly.
* Use the brute force approach only when necessary.
* Test your solution thoroughly.

CODEFORCES 679_D. Bear and Chase

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The input `n` and `m` are defined as integers, but the code uses them as floats. This will cause the program to crash.
2. **Off-by-one error.** The code incorrectly calculates the number of possible paths from city `i` to city `j`. It should be `(n - 1) * (n - 2)`, but the code uses `(n - 1) * (n - 3)`. This will cause the program to return an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The code incorrectly calculates the probability of finding Limak. It should be `1 - (1 / n)^2`, but the code uses `1 - (1 / n)^3`. This will cause the program to return an incorrect answer.
4. **Memory leak.** The code does not free the memory allocated for the array `adj`. This will eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
5. **Security vulnerability.** The code does not properly validate the input. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the program.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully check your code for errors before submitting it. You can use a debugger to help you find errors. You should also use a static analysis tool to check for potential security vulnerabilities.

Title:
CODEFORCES 723_F. st-Spanning Tree

Pain points:
1 2  ```
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake. For example, you might accidentally write "n m" instead of "n, m". This will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is given as integers, but you might accidentally treat it as strings. This will also cause the program to crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating over the input data, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one or more elements. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be correct in order to produce the correct output. A common mistake is to forget to check for special cases. For example, if the input data is empty, the program should output "No" instead of trying to build a spanning tree.
5. **Uncaught exceptions**. The program should be written in a way that catches all possible exceptions. If an exception is not caught, the program will crash.
6. **Memory leaks**. The program should be written in a way that does not leak memory. Memory leaks can cause the program to slow down and eventually crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 768_G. The Winds of Winter

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the DFS algorithm.** The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that visits all the nodes in a tree. It is a very powerful tool for traversing trees, but it can be easy to make mistakes when implementing it. One common mistake is to forget to check if a node has already been visited. This can lead to infinite recursion and a stack overflow.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the strength of the forest.** The strength of a forest is the number of nodes in the largest tree in the forest. To calculate the strength of the forest, you need to find all the trees in the forest and then find the largest one. This can be a bit tricky, but there are a few different ways to do it.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the Jon Snow algorithm.** The Jon Snow algorithm is an algorithm that tries to minimize the strength of the forest by reattaching a node to a different tree. To implement this algorithm, you need to find all the trees in the forest and then try to reattach each node to a different tree. This can be a bit tricky, but there are a few different ways to do it.
4. **Incorrect output.** The output of your program should be a list of integers, one for each node in the tree. The integer for each node should be the minimum strength of the forest when that node is removed.
5. **Incorrect formatting.** Your output should be formatted correctly. Make sure to use the correct number of spaces and line breaks.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

* **Test your code thoroughly.** This is the best way to find bugs in your code. Write unit tests for each function in your program and run them regularly.
* **Use a debugger.** A debugger can help you track down bugs in your code. It can show you the values of variables and the execution of your code line by line.
* **Ask for help.** If you are stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help. There are many online resources available, such as forums and Stack Overflow.

Title:
CODEFORCES 813_C. The Tag Game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may not be able to parse it correctly.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The data type of the input may not be what the program expects, which may also cause the program to crash. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program may not be able to convert it correctly.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program does not consider all possible cases, it may not find the optimal solution.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors occur when the program counts one more or one less than it should. For example, if the program counts the number of nodes in a tree incorrectly, it may not find the correct answer.
5. **Memory leaks.** Memory leaks occur when the program allocates memory but does not free it up when it is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions.** Race conditions occur when two or more parts of the program try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even crashes.
7. **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks occur when two or more parts of the program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can do so. This can also lead to the program crashing.
8. **Unhandled exceptions.** Unhandled exceptions occur when the program encounters an error that it cannot handle. This can lead to the program crashing or behaving in an unexpected way.
9. **Security vulnerabilities.** Security vulnerabilities occur when the program allows attackers to gain access to sensitive data or control the program in an unauthorized way. This can have serious consequences, such as identity theft or financial fraud.

CODEFORCES 839_B. Game of the Rows

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The input is given as two integers, but the code tries to divide one of them by another. This will cause a **division by zero** error.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator.** The code compares the sum of the soldiers' groups to the number of rows, but uses the `>` operator instead of the `>=` operator. This will cause a **false positive**, where the code incorrectly says that the soldiers can be placed in the airplane.
3. **Off-by-one error.** The code calculates the number of seats in each row by subtracting 1 from the total number of seats. This will cause a **one-seat discrepancy**, where the code incorrectly says that the soldiers cannot be placed in the airplane.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The code checks if the number of soldiers in each group is less than or equal to the number of seats in a row, but it does not check if the total number of soldiers is less than or equal to the total number of seats. This will cause a **false negative**, where the code incorrectly says that the soldiers cannot be placed in the airplane.
5. **Incorrect output.** The code prints the string `"YES"` if the soldiers can be placed in the airplane, but it does not print the string `"NO"` if the soldiers cannot be placed in the airplane. This will cause a **misleading output**, where the code incorrectly says that the soldiers can be placed in the airplane when they cannot.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully check your code for any errors. Make sure that you are using the correct variable types, operators, and logic. Also, make sure that your output is correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 884_D. Boxes And Balls

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of integers. If we use an incorrect data type to store the input data, such as a string, we will get a runtime error.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The problem is to find the minimum possible penalty of the game. A naive solution is to try every possible combination of turns and find the one with the minimum penalty. However, this solution is not efficient because the number of possible combinations is exponential in the number of boxes.

A more efficient solution is to use dynamic programming. We can define a table $dp[i][j][k]$, where $i$ is the number of boxes, $j$ is the number of balls, and $k$ is the number of empty boxes. $dp[i][j][k]$ represents the minimum possible penalty of the game if we have $i$ boxes, $j$ balls, and $k$ empty boxes.

We can fill the table in a bottom-up manner. For $i = 1$, $dp[i][j][k] = j$. For $i > 1$, we have the following recurrence relation:

$$dp[i][j][k] = min(dp[i - 1][j][k], dp[i - 1][j - a_i][k - 1] + a_i)$$

where $a_i$ is the number of balls of color $i$.

The final answer is $dp[n][0][0]$.

**3. Not handling special cases correctly**

The problem statement mentions that the number of boxes and colors is at most $200000$. We need to make sure that our algorithm handles this case correctly.

**4. Insufficient testing**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it to the judge. This will help you catch any bugs that you may have missed.

**5. Not using the most efficient data structure**

The problem requires us to store a table of size $O(n^3)$. We can use a 2D array to store this table, but this is not very efficient. A better solution is to use a 3D array, which has a space complexity of $O(n^2)$.

**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format specified in the problem statement is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain a line with more than two tokens, or a line with a token that is not an integer or a letter in the set {'R', 'G', 'B'}. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format specified in the problem statement is not strictly followed. For example, the output may contain more than one integer, or a non-integer value. This can lead to the program being marked as incorrect, even if it produces the correct answer.

**3. Insufficient memory**

The program may not allocate enough memory to store all of the data from the input. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.

**4. Incorrect algorithm**

The program may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. This can lead to the program producing incorrect output, or taking an excessive amount of time to run.

**5. Runtime errors**

The program may encounter runtime errors such as division by zero or accessing a memory location that is out of bounds. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.

**6. Logical errors**

The program may contain logical errors such as incorrect variable initialization or incorrect logic flow. This can lead to the program producing incorrect output or taking an excessive amount of time to run.

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is not very clear, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading in the data. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
* **Incorrect data type:** The data for this problem is given as a list of lists, but it is easy to make a mistake when converting the data to the correct data type. For example, if you forget to convert the numbers in the list to integers, the program will not be able to process the data correctly.
* **Off-by-one errors:** This problem is particularly prone to off-by-one errors, as the indices of the lists and arrays can easily be incorrect. For example, if you forget to add one to the index of a list, the program will not be able to access the correct element.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic for this problem is not very straightforward, and it is easy to make a mistake when implementing it. For example, if you forget to take into account all of the possible cases, the program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.
* **Memory leaks:** This problem can also be prone to memory leaks, as the data structures used can be quite large. For example, if you do not properly free the memory allocated

Title:
CODEFORCES 958_C1. Encryption (easy)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulo operation.** The modulo operation is a common source of errors in programming. Make sure you understand how it works and that you are using it correctly.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When splitting the array into two parts, it is easy to make a mistake and include one element in the wrong part. Be careful to check your indices carefully.
3. **Incorrect array bounds.** When accessing elements of the array, make sure you are using the correct indices. It is easy to accidentally access an element that is outside the bounds of the array, which will cause a runtime error.
4. **Incorrect data type.** The input data is given as a list of integers. Make sure you are using the correct data type to store this data. If you use the wrong data type, you may get incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm for finding the maximum score is not trivial. Make sure you understand the algorithm and that you are implementing it correctly.
6. **Incorrect test cases.** It is important to test your code with a variety of test cases. This will help you to identify and fix any errors in your code.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

1. A developer might incorrectly use the modulo operation, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the following code would incorrectly calculate the modulo of 1000001 modulo 10:

```
int mod = 10;
int result = 1000001 % mod;
```

The correct code would be:

```
int mod = 10;
int result = 1000001 % mod;
```

2. A developer might make an off-by-one error when splitting the array into two parts. For example, the following code would incorrectly split the array into two parts:

```
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int mid = arr.length / 2;
int[] left = new int[mid];
int[] right = new int[arr.length - mid];

for (int i = 0; i < mid; i++) {
  left[i] = arr[i];
}

for (int i = mid; i < arr.length; i++) {
  right[i - mid] = arr[i];
}
```

The correct code would be:

```
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int mid = arr.length / 2;
int[] left = new int[mid];
int[] right = new int[mid];

for (int i = 0; i < mid; i++) {
  left[i] = arr[i];
}

for (int i = mid; i < arr.length; i++) {
  right[i - mid] = arr[i];
}
```

3. A developer might incorrectly access an element of the array that is outside the bounds of the array. For example, the following code would cause a runtime error:

```
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int index = 5;
int value = arr[index];
```

The correct code would be:

```
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int index = 4;
int value = arr[index];
```

4. A developer might use the wrong data type to store the input data. For example, the following code would incorrectly store the input data as a string:

```
String[] arr = new String[N];
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
  arr[i] = sc.nextLine();
}
```

The correct code would be:

```
int[] arr = new int[N];
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
  arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
}
```

5. A developer might use an incorrect algorithm to find the maximum score. For example, the following algorithm would incorrectly find the maximum score:

```
int maxScore = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
  for (int j = i + 1; j < N; j++)

HACKEREARTH blackbox-2-8

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect formula for the factorial function.** The factorial function is defined as `n! = n * (n - 1) * ... * 2 * 1`. However, some developers may mistakenly use the following formula: `n! = n * (n - 1)!`. This will result in an incorrect answer for large values of `n`.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm for summing the digits in a number.** There are a number of different algorithms for summing the digits in a number. Some developers may use an inefficient algorithm, such as a recursive algorithm, which can be very slow for large numbers.

**3. Using an incorrect data type to store the factorial of a large number.** The factorial of a large number can be very large, and may not fit into a standard integer data type. Developers must be careful to use a data type that is large enough to store the factorial of the largest number that will be encountered.

**4. Not handling overflow errors correctly.** When computing the factorial of a large number, it is possible to overflow the data type used to store the factorial. Developers must be careful to check for overflow errors and handle them appropriately.

**5. Not handling negative numbers correctly.** The factorial function is not defined for negative numbers. Developers must be careful to check for negative numbers and return an appropriate error message.

**6. Not handling zero correctly.** The factorial of zero is equal to one. Developers must be careful to handle zero correctly and return the correct value.

**7. Not handling non-integer numbers correctly.** The factorial function is only defined for integers. Developers must be careful to check for non-integer numbers and return an appropriate error message.

**8. Using an incorrect programming language or environment.** Some programming languages or environments are not well-suited for computing the factorial of large numbers. Developers must be careful to choose a programming language or environment that is capable of handling large numbers.

**9. Not testing the code correctly.** It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. Developers should test the code with a variety of different inputs, including large numbers, negative numbers, zero, and non-integer numbers.

Title:
HACKEREARTH cricket-field

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect assumption about the input format.** The input format is not clearly specified in the problem statement. It is possible that a developer may incorrectly assume that the input format is different from what it actually is. This could lead to errors in the code.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for finding the prime numbers is not correctly implemented. This could lead to errors in the code.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The code does not correctly handle edge cases, such as when the input is invalid or when the output is not in the correct format. This could lead to errors in the code.
4. **Insufficient testing.** The code is not adequately tested. This could lead to errors in the code that are not caught until it is too late.

Title:
HACKEREARTH foo-and-exams-4

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the Foo_function**

The Foo_function is defined as follows:

```
F(t)=A(t^3)+B(t^2)+C*(t)+D
```

However, a developer may incorrectly implement the function as follows:

```
F(t)=A(t^2)+B(t)+C*(t)+D
```

This would result in incorrect results, as the Foo_function would no longer be a cubic equation.

**2. Using incorrect data types**

The input data for the problem is given as a list of five positive integers. However, a developer may incorrectly use the wrong data type to store this data. For example, they may use a list of strings to store the data, or they may use a list of floats. This would result in incorrect results, as the Foo_function would not be able to correctly process the data.

**3. Using incorrect mathematical operations**

The Foo_function is a cubic equation, and so it must be solved using cubic equations. However, a developer may incorrectly use the wrong mathematical operations to solve the equation. For example, they may use the quadratic formula to solve the equation, or they may use a numerical approximation method. This would result in incorrect results, as the Foo_function would not be correctly solved.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

The Foo_function may have certain edge cases that need to be handled. For example, the function may return a negative value, or it may return a value that is greater than the maximum allowed value. A developer must be careful to handle these edge cases correctly, or the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

**5. Using inefficient algorithms**

The Foo_function may be solved using a variety of different algorithms. However, some algorithms are more efficient than others. A developer should choose an efficient algorithm to solve the Foo_function, as this will improve the performance of the program.

**6. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is working correctly. This includes testing for incorrect implementations of the Foo_function, incorrect data types, incorrect mathematical operations, edge cases, and inefficient algorithms. By testing the code thoroughly, a developer can catch any errors and fix them before the program is released.

HACKEREARTH john-maria

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not correctly followed. For example, if the number of Boulevards and Woonerfs is not separated by a space, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The cost of the lunch should be a positive integer. However, if the input contains a negative integer or a non-integer value, the program will not be able to process it correctly.

**3. Undefined behavior**

The problem statement does not specify what should happen if Maria chooses a Boulevard that does not have any Woonerfs. In this case, the program may crash or produce an incorrect output.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

The program may incorrectly calculate the cost of the lunch by forgetting to add or subtract 1. This can happen if the program is not careful about the order of operations.

**5. Memory leaks**

The program may not properly release memory that it has allocated. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.

**6. Race conditions**

The program may not be thread-safe. This can happen if two threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even a crash.

**7. Security vulnerabilities**

The program may contain security vulnerabilities. For example, the program may not properly validate user input, which could allow an attacker to exploit the program.

Title:
HACKEREARTH sonya-wants-more-equal-numbers-icpc-3

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type:** The input is a list of integers, so you should use an integer array to store the input. If you use a string array, you will get a runtime error.
2. **Not using a loop:** The problem asks you to find the maximum number of elements with the same value, and to print all the values it could be. To do this, you need to iterate over the array and find all the occurrences of each value. If you don't use a loop, you will only find the first occurrence of each value.
3. **Using the wrong algorithm:** The problem can be solved using a simple greedy algorithm. You can start by sorting the array. Then, you can iterate over the array and merge any adjacent elements that have the same value. You can continue merging elements until you reach the end of the array. The maximum number of elements with the same value will be the number of elements in the final array.
4. **Not handling edge cases:** The problem specifies that the input array can contain up to 100 elements. If you try to iterate over an array with more than 100 elements, you will get a runtime error. You should also check for the special case where the input array is empty.

Pain points:
4317767
14778716 The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are as follows:

* **Incorrect implementation of the range update/range sum algorithm.** This is the most common mistake, and it can lead to incorrect results or even a segmentation fault. It is important to carefully implement the algorithm and to test it thoroughly.
* **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The range update/range sum algorithm can easily overflow if the input values are large. It is important to use a data type that is large enough to represent the input values, and to check for overflows carefully.
* **Incorrect handling of queries that overlap.** When two queries overlap, it is important to only update the range once. Otherwise, the results will be incorrect.
* **Incorrect handling of queries that are out of bounds.** It is important to check that the queries are in bounds before processing them. Otherwise, the results will be incorrect or the program may crash.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

ATCODER p02699 AtCoder Beginner Contest 164 - Sheep and Wolves

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is two integers, S and W. If we use the wrong data type, such as a string, to store these values, we will get a runtime error.

**2. Using an incorrect comparison operator**

The problem statement says that if the number of wolves is greater than or equal to that of sheep, the wolves will attack the sheep. So we need to compare the values of S and W using the `>=` operator. If we use the `>` operator, we will get the wrong answer.

**3. Not handling the case where S is equal to W**

The problem statement does not explicitly say what to do if S is equal to W. However, we can infer from the example inputs and outputs that if S is equal to W, then the sheep are safe. So we need to handle this case in our code.

**4. Not handling the case where S is less than W**

The problem statement does not explicitly say what to do if S is less than W. However, we can infer from the example inputs and outputs that if S is less than W, then the wolves will attack the sheep. So we need to handle this case in our code.

**5. Using an incorrect output format**

The problem statement says that if the wolves will attack the sheep, we should print `unsafe`. If the sheep are safe, we should print `safe`. So we need to make sure that our output format matches the expected format.

**2. Incorrect use of modulo operator**

The modulo operator should be used to ensure that the output is a multiple of 998244353. For example, the following code would not produce the correct output:

```
def solve(N, h):
  ans = 1
  for i in range(N):
    ans *= (h[i] + 1)
  return ans % 998244353
```

The correct code would be:

```
def solve(N, h):
  ans = 1
  for i in range(N):
    ans *= (h[i] + 1) % 998244353
  return ans
```

**3. Off-by-one error**

The following code would produce an incorrect output:

```
def solve(N, h):
  ans = 1
  for i in range(N):
    ans *= (h[i] + 1)
  return ans
```

The problem is that the code is counting the number of ways to place rooks in the first `h[0]` squares, then the number of ways to place rooks in the next `h[1]` squares, and so on. However, this is incorrect because the first `h[0]` squares are already covered by the rooks that were placed in the previous rows.

The correct code would be:

```
def solve(N, h):
  ans = 1
  for i in range(1, N):
    ans *= (h[i] + 1)
  return ans
```

**4. Incorrect use of the binomial coefficient**

The following code would produce an incorrect output:

```
def solve(N, h):
  ans = 1
  for i in range(N):
    ans *= (h[i] + 1)
  return ans
```

The problem is that the code is using the binomial coefficient `nCk` to count the number of ways to choose `k` rooks from a set of `n` rooks. However, this is incorrect because the rooks can be placed in any order.

The correct code would be:

```
def solve(N, h):
  ans = 1
  for i in range(N):
    ans *= h[i]
  return ans
```

**5. Incorrect use of the factorial function**

The following code would produce an incorrect output:

```
def solve(N, h):
  ans = 1
  for i in range(N):
    ans *= (h[i] + 1)
  return ans
```

The problem is that the code is using the factorial function `n!` to count the number of ways to choose `n` rooks from a set of `n` rooks. However, this is incorrect because the rooks can be placed in any order.

The correct code would be:

```
def solve(N, h):
  ans = 1
  for i in range(N):
    ans *= h[i]
  return ans
```

ATCODER p02965 AtCoder Grand Contest 036 - GP 2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of modulo operator**. The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. This means that if you divide two numbers and the result is not a whole number, the modulo operator will return the fractional part of the result. For example, 10 % 3 will return 1 because 10 divided by 3 is 3.333333... and the fractional part is 1.
2. **Incorrect use of factorial**. The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. When computing factorials, it is important to use the correct mathematical formula. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
n! = n * (n - 1)!
```

This is because the value of (n - 1)! will be incorrect if n is less than 2. The correct way to compute factorials is to use the following formula:

```
n! = n * (n - 1)! if n > 1
n! = 1 if n <= 1
```

3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of programming error that occurs when a programmer forgets to account for the first or last element in a list or array. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
for i in range(0, len(list)):
  # Do something with list[i]
```

This is because the range() function includes the start and end values, so the last element in the list will not be accessed. The correct way to write this code is as follows:

```
for i in range(1, len(list)):
  # Do something with list[i]
```

4. **Incorrect use of Boolean operators**. The Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT are used to combine multiple Boolean expressions into a single Boolean expression. For example, the following code will return True if either x or y is True:

```
x or y
```

The following code will return True if both x and y are True:

```
x and y
```

The following code will return False if either x or y is True:

```
not x or not y
```

It is important to use the correct Boolean operators when writing code, as incorrect use can lead to unexpected results.

5. **Incorrect use of parentheses**. Parentheses are used to group together expressions and to control the order of evaluation. For example, the following expression will return the value of x + y:

```
(x + y)
```

The following expression will return the value of y + x:

```
x + (y)
```

It is important to use parentheses correctly when writing code, as incorrect use can lead to unexpected results.

 **1. Using incorrect datatypes**

The input contains a lot of integers. If we use the wrong data type to store them, it may cause problems. For example, if we use `int` to store `MOD`, it may overflow when `MOD` is large.

**2. Using incorrect algorithms**

There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. We need to choose the right algorithm for the problem. For example, if the graph is very large, we may need to use a more efficient algorithm than a brute-force algorithm.

**3. Making mistakes in the implementation**

Even if we use the correct data types and algorithms, we may still make mistakes in the implementation. For example, we may forget to check for boundary conditions or we may make a mistake in a calculation.

**4. Not handling all cases**

The problem statement may not explicitly state all of the cases that need to be handled. For example, the problem statement does not explicitly state what to do if the graph is not connected. We need to make sure that we handle all of the cases that are not explicitly stated.

**5. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. We should test the code with a variety of inputs, including inputs that are likely to cause problems. We should also test the code with different data types and algorithms.

ATCODER p03399 AtCoder Beginner Contest 092 - Traveling Budget

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is specified as `A B C D`, but the developer may accidentally read the input as `A B C` or `A B D`. This will cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of minimum fare**. The minimum fare is the smaller of the train fare and the bus fare. The developer may accidentally calculate the sum of the train fare and the bus fare, or the maximum of the train fare and the bus fare. This will cause the program to produce incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may accidentally miscount the number of inputs or the number of iterations in a loop. This will cause the program to produce incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect variable type**. The input values are integers, but the developer may accidentally declare them as strings or floating-point numbers. This will cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
5. **Memory leak**. The developer may accidentally create a memory leak by not freeing up memory that is no longer needed. This can eventually cause the program to crash.
6. **Synchronization issue**. The developer may accidentally create a synchronization issue by accessing shared data from multiple threads without proper synchronization. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output or crash.
7. **Security vulnerability**. The developer may accidentally introduce a security vulnerability by allowing untrusted input to be used to control the program's behavior. This can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system or steal sensitive data.

Title:
ATCODER p03564 AtCoder Beginner Contest 076 - Addition and Multiplication

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input consists of two integers, N and K. If we use the wrong data type to store these values, we may get incorrect results. For example, if we use `int` to store `N` and `K`, we may get an overflow error when `N` is large.

**2. Not considering the corner cases**

The problem states that `1 <= N, K <= 10`. If we don't consider these corner cases, our program may not work correctly. For example, if `N` is 0, the program should print `1`. But if we don't consider the corner case, the program may print `0`.

**3. Making a mistake in the logic**

The problem asks us to find the minimum possible value displayed in the board after N operations. The naive solution is to perform each operation A and B once and take the minimum of the two results. However, this solution is not correct. For example, if `N` is 3 and `K` is 3, the minimum possible value is `7`, not `5`.

The correct solution is to first perform `N / 2` operations A and then perform `N % 2` operations B. This will ensure that the minimum possible value is displayed in the board after N operations.

**4. Not using the right data structures**

The problem states that `1 <= N, K <= 10`. This means that we can use a small data structure to store the values of `N` and `K`. For example, we can use an array of size 2 to store the values of `N` and `K`.

**5. Not using the right algorithms**

The problem can be solved using a simple greedy algorithm. The greedy algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize a variable `min_value` to 1.
2. While `N` is greater than 0:
    1. If `N` is even:
        * Double `min_value`.
    2. Otherwise:
        * Add `K` to `min_value`.
    3. Decrement `N` by 1.
3. Print `min_value`.

This algorithm will find the minimum possible value displayed in the board after N operations.

Title:
ATCODER p03719 AtCoder Beginner Contest 061 - Between Two Integers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect comparison operator**. The comparison operator used to compare `A`, `B`, and `C` must be `>` or `<=`. For example, the following code will not work:

```
if A < B < C:
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")
```

2. **Incorrect variable type**. The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` must be of type `int`. For example, the following code will not work:

```
A = "1"
B = "3"
C = "2"

if A < B < C:
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")
```

3. **Off-by-one error**. The condition `A < B < C` checks if `A` is less than `B` and `B` is less than `C`. However, if `A` is equal to `B`, the condition will be false. For example, the following code will not work:

```
A = 1
B = 1
C = 2

if A < B < C:
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")
```

4. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is `A B C`. If the input format is incorrect, the code will not work. For example, the following code will not work:

```
A, B, C = input().split()

if A < B < C:

ATCODER p04040 AtCoder Regular Contest 058 - Iroha and a Grid

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect calculation of the number of ways to reach the bottom-right cell.**

The number of ways to reach the bottom-right cell is given by the following formula:

```
N = (H - A + 1) * (W - B + 1)
```

However, some developers may incorrectly calculate the number of ways as follows:

```
N = H * W
```

This will result in an incorrect answer.

**2. Using an incorrect modulo operation.**

The number of ways to reach the bottom-right cell can be extremely large. To avoid overflow, the answer must be modulo 10^9+7.

Some developers may incorrectly use the following modulo operation:

```
N % 10^9 + 7
```

This will result in an incorrect answer.

**3. Using an incorrect data type.**

The number of ways to reach the bottom-right cell can be extremely large. To avoid overflow, the answer must be stored in a data type that can hold large integers.

Some developers may incorrectly use a data type that is too small, such as an integer. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**4. Not handling the case where A = H or B = W.**

In the case where A = H or B = W, the number of ways to reach the bottom-right cell is 0. Some developers may incorrectly assume that the number of ways is always 1. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**5. Not handling the case where H = 1 or W = 1.**

In the case where H = 1 or W = 1, the number of ways to reach the bottom-right cell is 1. Some developers may incorrectly assume that the number of ways is always 0. This will result in an incorrect answer.

Pain points:
**1. The input may not be in the correct format.** For example, the input may contain a year that is not a number, or the month or day may be outside the valid range. The developer should check the input for errors and raise an error if the input is not in the correct format.
2. **The developer may not correctly calculate the number of Friday the 13ths in the specified period.** The number of Friday the 13ths in a year depends on whether the year is a leap year. The developer should take this into account when calculating the number of Friday the 13ths.
3. **The developer may not correctly output the number of Friday the 13ths.** The output should be a single integer that represents the number of Friday the 13ths in the specified period. The developer should make sure that the output is formatted correctly.
4. **The developer may not handle corner cases correctly.** For example, the developer should handle the case where the start date is after the end date. The developer should also handle the case where the start date or end date is a Friday the 13th.
5. **The developer may introduce bugs into the code.** This could happen due to a number of reasons, such as typos, logical errors, or incorrect assumptions. The developer should carefully test the code to make sure that it is correct.

Title:
AIZU p01309 A Book Shop With a Frequent Greetings

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The problem statement specifies that the number of clerks, X, and Y should be integers, but the input data may contain non-integer values. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation.** The problem statement specifies that the clerks should repeat the greeting for X seconds, but the program may calculate the wrong number of seconds. This could also cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** The problem statement specifies that the clerks should stop repeating the greeting if they have already done so within the past Y seconds, but the program may not correctly check this condition. This could cause the program to continue repeating the greeting indefinitely, or to stop repeating the greeting too early.
4. **Incorrect use of pointers.** The problem statement specifies that the clerks should be able to hear each other, but the program may not correctly implement this functionality. This could cause the clerks to miss each other's greetings, or to greet each other multiple times.
5. **Memory leaks.** The program should free any memory that it allocates, but it may not do so correctly. This could cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
6. **Race conditions.** The program may not be thread-safe, which could lead to incorrect results or data corruption.
7. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program may not be secure, which could allow attackers to gain access to sensitive data or to execute arbitrary code.

Title:
AIZU p01478 Sort

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data is an integer array. If we use an incorrect data type, such as a string array, the program will not work correctly.

**2. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement specifies that $N$ must be between 2 and 8. If we do not handle this edge case, the program will crash.

**3. Using incorrect algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming algorithm. If we use an incorrect algorithm, the program will not find the correct answer.

**4. Not handling errors correctly**

The program should handle errors correctly. For example, if the user enters invalid input, the program should print an error message and exit.

**5. Not testing the program thoroughly**

It is important to test the program thoroughly before releasing it. This will help to catch any bugs that may have been missed during development.

Title:
AIZU p01638 Pie Chart is as easy as pie.

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct.**

The input format is `r x y n
p1 p2… pn`. However, the input may be in the following incorrect formats:

* `r x y n p1 p2… pn` (missing a space between `x` and `y`)
* `r x y n p1 p2… pn ` (missing a space between `n` and `p1`)
* `r x y n p1 p2… pn` (missing a space between `pn` and the newline character)

**2. The input data is invalid.**

The input data may be invalid in the following ways:

* `r` is not equal to 100.
* `x^2 + y^2` is greater than `r^2`.
* `n` is less than 2 or greater than 10.
* `p_i` is less than 0 for some `i`.
* `\sum_{1 \le i \le n} p_i` is not equal to 100.

**3. The output format is not correct.**

The output format is `p1 p2… pn`. However, the output may be in the following incorrect formats:

* `p1 p2… pn` (missing a space between `p1` and `p2`)
* `p1 p2… pn ` (missing a space between `pn` and the newline character)

**4. The output data is incorrect.**

The output data may be incorrect in the following ways:

* The values of `p_i` are not rounded down to an integer.
* The sum of the values of `p_i` is not equal to 100.

**5. The program does not handle all possible cases.**

The program may not handle all possible cases, such as:

* The input data is very large.

Title:
AIZU p01790 Balanced Paths

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of nodes in a tree.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. To avoid this, make sure to carefully count the number of nodes in the tree, including the root node.
2. **Incorrectly identifying the balanced paths in a tree.** A balanced path is a path in a tree where the number of nodes on the left side of the path is equal to the number of nodes on the right side of the path. To identify the balanced paths in a tree, you can use a depth-first search or a breadth-first search.
3. **Incorrectly calculating the number of balanced paths in a tree.** The number of balanced paths in a tree can be calculated using the following formula:

```
N = (2^n - 1) / (n + 1)
```

where N is the number of balanced paths and n is the number of nodes in the tree.

4. **Incorrectly printing the output.** Make sure to carefully format the output so that it is easy to read and understand.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use a test suite to thoroughly test your code.
* Use a debugger to step through your code and identify any errors.
* Ask for help from a mentor or colleague if you are stuck.

Title:
AIZU p02359 The Maximum Number of Customers

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect data type

The input data is given in the format of `N T l_1 r_1 l_2 r_2 ... l_N r_N`. The developer may incorrectly parse the input data and get the wrong data type. For example, the developer may parse the input data as `int N, int T, int l_1, int r_1, int l_2, int r_2, ..., int l_N, int r_N`. This will cause the developer to get the wrong answer.

### 2. Incorrect logic

The developer may incorrectly implement the logic to find the maximum number of persons during the business hours. For example, the developer may only consider the persons who entered the restaurant before they left. This will cause the developer to get the wrong answer.

### 3. Off-by-one error

The developer may make an off-by-one error when calculating the maximum number of persons during the business hours. For example, the developer may forget to add 1 to the maximum number of persons when a new person enters the restaurant. This will cause the developer to get the wrong answer.

### 4. Runtime error

The developer may make a runtime error when implementing the solution. For example, the developer may use an array to store the data of the persons, but the array is not big enough. This will cause the developer to get a runtime error.
