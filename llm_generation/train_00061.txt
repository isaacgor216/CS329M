Title:
CODECHEF taaplusb

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the column addition method.** The most common mistake is to forget to carry the carry from one column to the next. This can lead to incorrect results, especially when adding large numbers.
2. **Using an incorrect data type.** The primitive data types in most programming languages are not large enough to represent very large numbers. This can lead to overflow errors, which can also cause incorrect results.
3. **Not handling negative numbers correctly.** The column addition method works only for adding positive numbers. If you try to add two negative numbers, the results will be incorrect.
4. **Not handling zeroes correctly.** When adding two numbers, if one of the numbers is zero, the result will be the same as the other number. This is not always what you want, so you need to be careful when handling zeroes.
5. **Not handling carries correctly.** When adding two numbers, it is possible for the carry to be greater than the number being added. This can lead to incorrect results if you are not careful.
6. **Not handling overflow errors correctly.** When adding two numbers, it is possible for the result to be greater than the maximum value that can be represented by the data type you are using. This can lead to overflow errors, which can also cause incorrect results.
7. **Not handling underflow errors correctly.** When adding two numbers, it is possible for the result to be less than the minimum value that can be represented by the data type you are using. This can lead to underflow errors, which can also cause incorrect results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1034_C. Region Separation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that can be used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. When implemented incorrectly, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm can produce incorrect results, such as negative distances or cycles of length 0.
2. **Using an incorrect data structure to store the graph.** The data structure used to store the graph can have a significant impact on the performance of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. For example, using an adjacency list data structure can be much faster than using an adjacency matrix data structure.
3. **Using an incorrect value for the modulus.** The modulus used in the Floyd-Warshall algorithm must be a prime number. If the modulus is not a prime number, the algorithm can produce incorrect results.
4. **Not handling negative weights correctly.** The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can only be used on graphs with non-negative weights. If the graph contains negative weights, the algorithm will produce incorrect results.
5. **Not handling duplicate edges correctly.** The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can only be used on graphs with no duplicate edges. If the graph contains duplicate edges, the algorithm will produce incorrect results.
6. **Not handling self-loops correctly.** The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can only be used on graphs with no self-loops. If the graph contains self-loops, the algorithm will produce incorrect results.
7. **Not handling disconnected graphs correctly.** The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can only be used on connected graphs. If the graph is disconnected, the algorithm will produce incorrect results.
8. **Not handling graphs with negative cycles correctly.** The Floyd-Warshall algorithm cannot be used on graphs with negative cycles. If the graph contains a negative cycle, the algorithm will enter an infinite loop.

CODEFORCES 1056_H. Detect Robots

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect data type:** The input data is given as a string, but the developer may accidentally parse it as an integer. This would result in incorrect results.
* **Off-by-one error:** The developer may accidentally miss one or more rides when iterating through the list of rides. This would result in incorrect results.
* **Incorrect logic:** The developer may incorrectly implement the algorithm for determining whether the driver is a robot. This would result in incorrect results.
* **Memory leak:** The developer may accidentally create a memory leak by not freeing the memory allocated for the data structures used in the solution. This could lead to the program crashing or running out of memory.
* **Time complexity:** The developer may implement the solution in a way that has a time complexity that is too high. This could lead to the program running slowly or even taking too long to terminate.
* **Space complexity:** The developer may implement the solution in a way that has a space complexity that is too high. This could lead to the program using too much memory, which could lead to the program crashing or running out of memory.

Title:
CODEFORCES 107_D. Crime Management

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not always correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is "5 2 A 1 B 2", the program will incorrectly parse the second line as "A 1 B 2" and will not consider the second condition.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format must be correct, or the program will not be accepted. For example, if the output is "16A", the program will not be accepted.
* **Off-by-one errors:** Off-by-one errors are common when programming, and can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program is supposed to count the number of ways to commit n crimes, but it counts the number of ways to commit n + 1 crimes, the result will be incorrect.
* **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic:** Modulo arithmetic is often used in programming competitions, and it is important to use it correctly. For example, if the program is supposed to find the remainder of n divided by 12345, but it instead finds the quotient of n divided by 12345, the result will be incorrect.
* **Incorrect use of bitwise operators:** Bitwise operators are often used in programming competitions, and it is important to use them correctly. For example, if the program is supposed to find the number of bits set in a number, but it instead finds the number of bits cleared in the number, the result will be incorrect.
* **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers:** Floating-point numbers are often used in programming competitions, and it is important to use them correctly. For example, if the program is supposed to find the square root of a number, but it instead finds the square of the number, the result will be incorrect.
* **Incorrect use of pointers:** Pointers are often used in programming competitions, and it is important to use them correctly. For example, if the program is supposed to free a memory block, but it instead frees a different memory block, the program will crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 109_C. Lucky Tree

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data contains a lot of integers. If you use an incorrect data type to store them, you may get incorrect results. For example, if you use `int` to store a `long long` integer, you may get an integer overflow error.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The problem asks for the number of vertex triples that satisfy the given condition. A naive solution is to enumerate all possible triples and check if they satisfy the condition. This solution has a time complexity of `O(n^3)`, which is too slow. A more efficient solution is to use dynamic programming.

**3. Incorrect implementation**

Even if you use the correct data type and algorithm, you may still get incorrect results if your implementation is incorrect. For example, you may forget to initialize a variable or you may make a mistake in a calculation.

**4. Undefined behavior**

The C++ standard does not define the behavior of a program in some cases. For example, if you divide an integer by zero, the standard does not define what the result should be. If you do not handle undefined behavior correctly, you may get incorrect results or your program may crash.

**5. Memory leaks**

If you do not free the memory that you allocate, you may eventually run out of memory and your program will crash.

**6. Race conditions**

If you are using multiple threads, you need to be careful to avoid race conditions. A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. If the threads are not synchronized, the results may be incorrect.

**7. Deadlocks**

If you are using multiple threads, you need to be careful to avoid deadlocks. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. If the threads are not able to release the locks, they will be stuck forever.

**8. Security vulnerabilities**

If you are not careful, your program may be vulnerable to security attacks. For example, your program may be vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks or SQL injection attacks.
Test inputs:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;

    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        int u, v, w;
        cin >> u >> v >> w;
        adj[u].push_back(v);
        adj[v].push_back(u);
    }

    int ans = 0;

Title:
CODEFORCES 1169_A. Circle Metro

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains five integers, but the developer may accidentally use a data type that is not large enough to hold all of the values. This could lead to errors such as overflow or underflow, which would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**2. Using incorrect logic**

The developer may make a mistake in the logic of their program, such as using the wrong formula to calculate the time at which Daniel and Vlad will be at the same station. This could lead to the program incorrectly determining whether or not the two toads will ever be at the same station.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

The developer may not handle edge cases correctly, such as the case where Daniel and Vlad are both at the same station at the beginning of their journey. This could lead to the program incorrectly determining whether or not the two toads will ever be at the same station.

**4. Using incorrect variable names**

The developer may use variable names that are not descriptive or that are too similar to each other. This could make the code difficult to read and understand, and it could also lead to errors.

**5. Not commenting the code**

What happens if the tree has only one vertex? It is important to handle these corner cases correctly, as any mistakes will lead to an incorrect answer.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that developers may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly implementing the k-coloring algorithm.** A common mistake that developers make is to incorrectly implement the k-coloring algorithm. For example, they may forget to check that each color is used no more than two times, or they may not correctly handle the case where two vertices are connected by multiple edges.
* **Incorrectly calculating the sum of weights of saturated edges.** Another common mistake that developers make is to incorrectly calculate the sum of weights of saturated edges. For example, they may forget to add the weight of an edge to the sum if both of its endpoints are assigned the same color.
* **Not handling corner cases correctly.** Developers also need to be aware of corner cases when solving this problem. For example, what happens if the tree has no edges? What happens if the tree has only one vertex? It is important to handle these corner cases correctly, as any mistakes will lead to an incorrect answer.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* **Test your code thoroughly.** The best way to avoid bugs is to test your code thoroughly. This means testing your code on a variety of inputs, including inputs that are likely to cause problems.
* **Use a debugger.** A debugger can be a helpful tool for debugging problems in your code. A debugger allows you to step through your code line by line, and it can help you to identify the source of any errors.
* **Ask for help.** If you are stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help. There are many online resources available, such as forums and online tutorials. You can also ask for help from friends or colleagues.

Title:
CODEFORCES 128_B. String

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem states that the first line should contain a non-empty string that only consists of small Latin letters ("a"-"z"), whose length does not exceed 105. The second line contains the only integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 105). If the input format is not correct, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem states that the program should print the string Anna and Maria need — the k-th (in the lexicographical order) substring of the given string. If the total number of substrings is less than k, the program should print a string saying "No such line." (without the quotes). If the output format is not correct, the program will receive a WA (Wrong Answer) verdict.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the lexicographical order**. The lexicographical order of strings is defined as follows:
    * A string x is lexicographically less than string y, if either x is a prefix of y (and x ≠ y), or there exists such i (1 ≤ i ≤ min(|x|, |y|)), that xi < yi, and for any j (1 ≤ j < i) xj = yj.
    If the implementation of the lexicographical order is incorrect, the program may output incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the k-th substring**. The k-th substring of the given string is the substring that appears in the lexicographical order at the k-th position. If the calculation of the k-th substring is incorrect, the program may output incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. The problem statement specifies a few edge cases:
    * The total number of substrings may be less than k.
    * The input string may be empty.
    * The input string may contain only one character.
    If the program does not handle these edge cases correctly, it may crash or output incorrect results.
Test inputs:

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of brackets.** The most common mistake is to use the wrong type of bracket. For example, you might use a square bracket instead of a round bracket.
2. **Mismatched brackets.** Another common mistake is to have unmatched brackets. For example, you might have a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket.
3. **Incorrect nesting of brackets.** The order of brackets is important. For example, you cannot have a closing bracket before an opening bracket.
4. **Unbalanced brackets.** The number of opening brackets must equal the number of closing brackets. For example, you cannot have more opening brackets than closing brackets, or vice versa.
5. **Incorrect use of parentheses.** Parentheses are used to group expressions together. For example, you might use parentheses to indicate the order of operations in an arithmetic expression.
6. **Missing parentheses.** Parentheses are often necessary to make your code clear and concise. For example, you might need to use parentheses to clarify the order of operations in an arithmetic expression.
7. **Extra parentheses.** Parentheses can sometimes be added unnecessarily. For example, you might add parentheses around an expression that is already clear and concise.
8. **Incorrect use of curly braces.** Curly braces are used to define blocks of code. For example, you might use curly braces to define the scope of a variable or function.
9. **Mismatched curly braces.** The order of curly braces is important. For example, you cannot have a closing curly brace before an opening curly brace.
10. **Unbalanced curly braces.** The number of opening curly braces must equal the number of closing curly braces. For example, you cannot have more opening curly braces than closing braces, or vice versa.

CODEFORCES 1419_E. Decryption

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very strict. It is possible to enter a number that is not a composite number, or to enter a number that is too large. If this happens, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also not very strict. It is possible to output the numbers in the wrong order, or to output a number that is not an integer. If this happens, the program will not produce the correct answer.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the least common multiple**

The least common multiple of two numbers is the smallest number that is divisible by both numbers. To calculate the least common multiple, you can use the following formula:

```
lcm(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b)
```

where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.

If you calculate the least common multiple incorrectly, the program will not produce the correct answer.

**4. Incorrect insertion of the least common multiple**

Once you have calculated the least common multiple of two numbers, you need to insert it into the circle. To do this, you need to find the two numbers that are adjacent to each other in the circle, and then insert the least common multiple between them.

If you insert the least common multiple incorrectly, the program will not produce the correct answer.

**5. Incorrect calculation of the number of moves needed to decrypt the message**

The number of moves needed to decrypt the message is the number of times you need to insert the least common multiple between two adjacent numbers. To calculate this number, you can simply add up the number of times you insert the least common multiple for each pair of adjacent numbers.

If you calculate the number of moves incorrectly, the program will not produce the correct answer.

CODEFORCES 165_B. Burning Midnight Oil

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be two integers n and k, separated by spaces. Make sure to check that the input is in the correct format before you start processing it.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The input integers n and k should be of type `int`. Make sure to cast them to the correct type before you use them in your calculations.
3. **Arithmetic errors.** When calculating the minimum value of v, you need to take into account the fact that Vasya falls asleep when `v / k` is equal to 0. This means that you need to round `v / k` down to the nearest integer.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the minimum value of v, you need to make sure that you account for the fact that Vasya writes v lines of code before he takes his first break. This means that the minimum value of v should be one greater than the number of lines of code that Vasya needs to write.
5. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer, which is the minimum value of v that lets Vasya write the program in one night. Make sure to format your output correctly.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use the `input()` function to read the input from the console.
* Use the `int()` function to cast the input integers to the correct type.
* Use the `round()` function to round `v / k` down to the nearest integer.
* Use the `max()` function to make sure that the minimum value of v is one greater than the number of lines of code that Vasya needs to write.
* Use the `print()` function to print the output to the console.

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific. The first line should contain the document identifier, the second line should contain the name of the document, and the third and subsequent lines should contain the text of the document. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly process the input and will produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output for this problem should be an integer from 1 to 3, inclusive. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly process the output and will receive a negative score.
3. **Malformed documents**. The documents in the training set are all formatted correctly. However, it is possible that the documents that are given as input to the program will be malformed. For example, the document text may contain invalid characters, or the document may not be divided into lines correctly. If the documents are malformed, the program will not be able to correctly process them and will produce incorrect output.
4. **Memory issues**. The training set for this problem is relatively small, so it is unlikely that the program will run out of memory. However, it is possible that the documents that are given as input to the program will be very large. If the documents are too large, the program may run out of memory and crash.
5. **Timeout**. The time limit for this problem is 1 second. If the program takes longer than 1 second to process the input, it will receive a negative score.
6. **Incorrect logic**. The logic for this problem is relatively simple. However, it is possible that the program will contain errors in the logic. For example, the program may not correctly identify the subject of the document, or it may produce incorrect output. If the logic is incorrect, the program will receive a negative score.

CODEFORCES 232_D. Fence

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly specified. For example, the input may contain a number of planks that is not an integer, or the width of a piece of the fence may be negative. The developer should check the input format and handle incorrect input gracefully.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correctly specified. For example, the output may contain a number of matching pieces that is not an integer. The developer should check the output format and handle incorrect output gracefully.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm for solving the problem. For example, the algorithm may not correctly handle the case when two pieces of the fence intersect. The developer should carefully design and implement the algorithm to ensure that it is correct.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer may not correctly free the memory that is allocated during the execution of the program. This may lead to memory leaks, which can eventually cause the program to crash. The developer should carefully manage the memory usage to avoid memory leaks.
5. **Synchronization issues**. The developer may not correctly synchronize the access to shared data between multiple threads. This may lead to race conditions, which can cause the program to produce incorrect results or even crash. The developer should carefully design the synchronization mechanisms to avoid synchronization issues.
6. **Testing errors**. The developer may not test the program thoroughly enough. This may lead to bugs that are not caught until the program is deployed in production. The developer should write a comprehensive test suite to ensure that the program is correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 258_C. Little Elephant and LCM

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a list of integers. If you use the wrong data type to store the input data, you may get incorrect results. For example, if you use a list of strings to store the input data, you may get incorrect results because the string "1" and the integer 1 are not the same.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. If you use the wrong algorithm, you may get incorrect results. For example, if you use a brute-force algorithm to solve this problem, you may get incorrect results because the brute-force algorithm is very inefficient.

**3. Not handling corner cases correctly**

There are some corner cases that you need to handle correctly when solving this problem. For example, if the input data is empty, you need to return 0. If the input data contains only one element, you need to return 1.

**4. Making a mistake in your implementation**

Even if you use the right data type, the right algorithm, and handle the corner cases correctly, you may still make a mistake in your implementation. For example, you may forget to add a modulus operator to your answer, or you may make a mistake in your arithmetic calculations.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it to the judge. This will help you to identify any bugs in your code and fix them before it is too late.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input is "1 2 3 a", the program will not be able to parse the input correctly and will crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the area**. The area of the overlapping region is calculated incorrectly, which will result in an incorrect answer. For example, if the two rectangles are not overlapping, the program will still calculate the area of the overlapping region, which will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect rounding of the answer**. The answer is rounded to a certain number of decimal places, which may cause the answer to be incorrect. For example, if the answer is 1.23456789, the program may round it to 1.234568, which is incorrect.
4. **Other bugs**. There may be other bugs in the program that are not listed here. For example, the program may not handle negative numbers correctly, or it may crash due to a memory error.

CODEFORCES 304_B. Calendar

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is yyyy:mm:dd, but the developer may accidentally use a different format, such as dd/mm/yyyy. This will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of days between two dates.** The developer may forget to take into account leap years, or may incorrectly calculate the number of days in a month. This will result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer, but the developer may accidentally print multiple lines of output, or may print the output in the wrong format. This will cause the program to fail the test cases.
4. **Other bugs.** There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem, such as using incorrect data types, or making logical errors in the code. It is important to carefully review the code to ensure that it is correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 330_C. Purification

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of variables**

One common mistake is to use the same variable for multiple purposes. For example, you might declare a variable `i` to count the number of rows, and then later use it to index into an array. This can lead to errors if you accidentally increment `i` more than once in a loop.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

Another common mistake is to forget to increment or decrement a variable by one. For example, you might write a loop that iterates over the numbers from 1 to 10, but then forget to increment the variable `i` in the loop body. This will cause the loop to only iterate over the numbers from 1 to 9.

**3. Logical errors**

Logical errors are errors that occur when the code does not do what you intended it to do. For example, you might write a function to calculate the area of a circle, but forget to multiply the radius by pi. This would cause the function to return the wrong answer.

**4. Runtime errors**

Runtime errors are errors that occur when the code is actually running. For example, you might try to divide a number by zero. This will cause the program to crash.

**5. Syntax errors**

Syntax errors are errors that occur when the code is not written correctly. For example, you might forget to close a bracket or quote. This will cause the compiler to flag an error.

Title:
CODEFORCES 352_A. Jeff and Digits

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type**

The input data contains integers, so we should use an integer data type to store the number of cards and the digits on each card. Using a floating-point data type could lead to incorrect results.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the largest possible number divisible by 90. A naive algorithm would be to iterate through all possible combinations of cards and check if the resulting number is divisible by 90. This algorithm would have a time complexity of O(n^2), which is too slow for large values of n.

A more efficient algorithm would be to use the following greedy approach:

1. Sort the cards in descending order by the number of 5s.
2. Iterate through the cards, adding 5s to the result until the remainder of the result divided by 90 is 0.
3. If the remainder is not 0, the answer is -1.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n), which is much faster than the naive algorithm.

**3. Not handling corner cases**

The problem statement specifies that the number of cards must be between 1 and 103. We should make sure to check for this condition before running our algorithm.

The problem statement also specifies that the digits on the cards must be either 0 or 5. We should make sure to check for this condition before running our algorithm.

**4. Using incorrect variable names**

The problem statement uses the following variable names:

* n: the number of cards
* a1, a2, ..., an: the digits on each card

We should use these same variable names in our code to avoid confusion.

**5. Not commenting your code**

It is always a good idea to comment your code so that other developers can understand what it does. This is especially important for code that solves a complex problem, such as the problem in this post.

Title:
CODEFORCES 376_B. I.O.U.

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not specified.**

The input format is not specified in the problem statement. This can lead to confusion and errors when writing the code. For example, if the input format is not specified, a developer might accidentally assume that the input is a list of lists, when it is actually a list of strings.

**2. The output format is not specified.**

The output format is not specified in the problem statement. This can lead to confusion and errors when writing the code. For example, if the output format is not specified, a developer might accidentally print the wrong type of data, such as a string instead of an integer.

**3. The problem is not well-defined.**

The problem is not well-defined in the problem statement. This can lead to confusion and errors when writing the code. For example, the problem statement does not specify what it means for a debt to be "optimally rearranged". This could lead to different interpretations of the problem, which could result in different solutions.

**4. The problem is too difficult.**

The problem is too difficult for the given time limit. This can lead to developers giving up on the problem or submitting incorrect solutions. For example, the problem requires the developer to find the minimum sum of debts in the optimal rearrangement. This is a difficult problem to solve in the given time limit.

**5. The problem is too easy.**

The problem is too easy for the given time limit. This can lead to developers submitting incorrect solutions or not learning anything from the problem. For example, the problem requires the developer to print the minimum sum of debts in the optimal rearrangement. This is a very simple problem that can be solved in a few lines of code.

For example, the algorithm may not find the minimum possible total loquacity of the top-secret troop. The developer should carefully test the algorithm and make sure that it is correct.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer may not properly manage memory, which can lead to memory leaks. Memory leaks can cause the program to crash or run out of memory. The developer should use a memory management tool to track memory usage and identify memory leaks.
5. **Synchronization issues**. The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data, which can lead to race conditions. Race conditions can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash. The developer should use a synchronization mechanism to ensure that only one thread can access shared data at a time.
6. **Deadlocks**. The developer may create deadlocks, which can prevent the program from making progress. Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. The developer should use a deadlock avoidance or deadlock prevention algorithm to prevent deadlocks.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer may introduce security vulnerabilities into the program. For example, the program may allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to data or execute arbitrary code. The developer should carefully review the program for security vulnerabilities and implement appropriate security measures.

CODEFORCES 612_C. Replace To Make Regular Bracket Sequence

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of brackets.** The problem states that you can only replace brackets of the same type, but some solutions may try to replace a closing bracket with an opening bracket of a different type. This will result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect use of the stack.** The problem states that you can only replace brackets that are already open. Some solutions may try to replace a closing bracket that is not currently open, which will result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When counting the number of open and closing brackets, it is important to make sure that you don't miss any brackets or count any brackets twice. This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect answers.
4. **Incorrect use of the output format.** The problem states that you must print the least number of replaces needed to get RBS from s. Some solutions may print the wrong number of replaces, or they may not print anything at all.
5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include incorrect use of the data structures, incorrect logic, and runtime errors.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements. It is also important to test your solution thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly.

CODEFORCES 632_C. The Smallest String Concatenation

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input strings are all of length at most 50, so it's tempting to use a string array to store them. However, this can lead to problems if the strings are very long, as the string array will take up a lot of memory. A better solution is to use a vector of characters, which is a more efficient data structure for storing small strings.

**2. Not sorting the strings**

The problem asks for the lexicographically smallest string concatenation, so it's important to sort the strings before concatenating them. If the strings are not sorted, the resulting string may not be the lexicographically smallest possible.

**3. Using the wrong concatenation operator**

The concatenation operator (+) is used to concatenate two strings together. However, this operator does not preserve the order of the strings. To concatenate the strings in the correct order, you need to use the << operator.

**4. Concatenating the strings in the wrong order**

The problem asks for the lexicographically smallest string concatenation, so it's important to concatenate the strings in the correct order. The correct order is the lexicographical order, which is the order in which the strings would appear in a dictionary.

**5. Not handling duplicate strings correctly**

The problem does not specify what to do if there are duplicate strings in the input. One possible solution is to ignore the duplicate strings and only concatenate the unique strings. Another solution is to concatenate the duplicate strings together and treat them as a single string.

**6. Not handling invalid input correctly**

The problem does not specify what to do if the input is invalid. One possible solution is to print an error message and exit the program. Another solution is to try to fix the invalid input and continue with the problem.

CODEFORCES 683_J. The Hero with Bombs

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect maze input**. The input maze should be a rectangular field of size n × m, where n and m are integers and n·m > 1. For example, the following maze is incorrect:

```
3 5
XEX.X
X.XXT
X.X.X
```

The correct maze should be:

```
3 5
XEX.X
X.XXT
X.X..
```

2. **Incorrect hero position**. The hero should be located in one of the cells of the maze. For example, the following maze is incorrect:

```
3 5
XEX.X
X.XXT
X.X.X
```

The hero should be located in one of the cells, but in this maze there is no hero.

3. **Incorrect exit position**. There should be exactly one exit in the maze. For example, the following maze is incorrect:

```
3 5
XEX.X
X.XXT
X.X.X
```

The maze has two exits: one in the top right corner and one in the bottom left corner.

4. **Incorrect hero actions**. The hero can only move to the next cell (i.e. the cell which has a common side with the current cell) if it is free, or plant a bomb on the cell where he is, or skip the move and do nothing. For example, the following sequence of hero actions is incorrect:

```
MTT
```

The hero planted a bomb in the first move, but in the second move he skipped the move. This is not allowed.

5. **Incorrect explosion**. The explosion destroys the obstacles in all the cells which have at least one common point with this cell (i.e. in all the cells sharing with the bomb cell a corner or a side). The explosion must not hurt the cell with the exit or the cell with the hero. For example, the following maze is incorrect:

```
3 5
XEX.X
X.XXT
X.X.X
```

The hero planted a bomb in the first move. The explosion destroyed the obstacle in the cell to the left of the hero, but it also destroyed the exit. This is not allowed.

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect data type:** The input data is given as three integers, but the first line may contain a floating-point number. This will cause the program to crash.
* **Incorrect format:** The input data is given in a specific format, but the program may not be able to parse it correctly. This could lead to the program outputting incorrect results.
* **Off-by-one error:** The program may incorrectly count the number of books in the bookcase, resulting in an incorrect answer.
* **Memory leak:** The program may not release memory that it has allocated, which could eventually lead to a system crash.
* **Race condition:** The program may not be thread-safe, which could lead to incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the bookcase at the same time.

Title:
CODEFORCES 72_E. Ali goes shopping

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of comparison operators.** The problem statement specifies that the substring with the **maximal length** should be chosen, so comparing substrings using the `==` operator will not work. For example, the substrings `a` and `ab` both have a repeat time of 3 in the string `abababababababab`, but `ab` is the correct answer because it has a longer length.
2. **Incorrect use of string functions.** The problem statement specifies that the answer should be a **single line**, so using string functions such as `split()` or `join()` will not work. The correct way to output the answer is to use the `print()` function.
3. **Incorrect use of loops.** The problem statement specifies that the answer should be the **longest** substring with the **maximal repeat time**, so using a loop to iterate over all possible substrings will not work. The correct way to find the longest substring with the maximal repeat time is to use a dynamic programming algorithm.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input string is empty or contains only one character. In these cases, the correct answer is the empty string.
5. **Incorrect use of the `max()` function.** The problem statement specifies that the substring with the **maximal repeat time** should be chosen, so using the `max()` function to compare the repeat times of different substrings will not work. The correct way to find the substring with the maximal repeat time is to use a hash table.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may contain extra spaces, or it may not be capitalized correctly.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The solution may not be correct. For example, the solution may not check all of the conditions that are specified in the problem statement, or it may not handle all of the possible input cases.
4. **Runtime error**. The solution may not run correctly due to a runtime error. For example, the solution may run out of memory, or it may divide by zero.
5. **Time limit exceeded**. The solution may not run within the time limit that is specified in the problem statement.
6. **Memory limit exceeded**. The solution may use more memory than is allowed by the problem statement.
7. **Presentation error**. The solution may not be presented in the correct format. For example, the solution may not print the output to the correct output stream, or it may not print the output in the correct format.
8. **Other errors**. There are a number of other possible errors that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the solution may not be modular, or it may not be documented correctly.

The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are:

* **Incorrect test cases:** The developer may generate test cases that are not valid or do not test the solution correctly. This can lead to the developer believing that the solution is correct when it is not.
* **Incorrect implementation:** The developer may implement the solution incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect results. This can be caused by a variety of errors, such as incorrect logic, incorrect data types, or incorrect use of functions.
* **Incorrect testing:** The developer may not test the solution thoroughly enough, which can lead to the developer believing that the solution is correct when it is not. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as not testing all possible input cases, not testing the solution with different data types, or not testing the solution with different edge cases.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully consider the following:

* The input format and constraints of the problem.
* The expected output of the problem.
* The different ways to solve the problem.
* The different ways to test the solution.

By carefully considering these factors, the developer can significantly reduce the likelihood of making errors when solving this problem.

### 1. The input may not be valid. For example, the input ```
n = 1
a = [-1]
```
is not valid because ```a[0] = -1``` is not a valid value for ```a[0]```.

### 2. The output may not be valid. For example, the output ```
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
is not valid because ```1``` and ```2``` are not distinct.

### 3. The code may not be efficient. For example, the following code is not efficient:

```python
def solve(n, a):
  """
  Solves the problem.

  Args:
    n: The length of the permutation.
    a: The code of the permutation.

  Returns:

  p = [0] * n

  # Iterate over the elements of the code.

  for i in range(n):
    # Find the smallest unmarked element that is greater than the current element.

    j = min(a[i + 1:] + [n + 1], key=lambda j: j - a[i])

    # Mark the element.

    a[j] = n + 1

    # Assign the element to the current position in the permutation.

    p[i] = j

  # Return the permutation.

CODEFORCES 989_A. A Blend of Springtime

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input string should only contain uppercase English letters 'A', 'B', 'C' and characters '.' (dots). If the input string contains any other characters, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be either "Yes" or "No". If the output is not in the correct format, the program will get a compilation error.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program should check if it is possible that all three colors appear in some cell after some (possibly none or all) flowers shed their petals. If the program does not check this correctly, it will give the wrong answer.
4. **Memory leak**. The program should not allocate any memory that it does not need. If the program does allocate memory that it does not need, it will eventually run out of memory and crash.
5. **Timeout**. The program should run in a reasonable amount of time. If the program takes too long to run, it will not be able to finish on time and will get a time limit exceeded error.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to write the program carefully and test it thoroughly to make sure that it is correct and does not have any bugs.

HACKEREARTH amit-and-cookies

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect sorting**. The cookies should be sorted in ascending order of their prices. If they are not sorted, the solution may be incorrect.
2. **Incorrect use of `max()` function**. The `max()` function returns the maximum element in a list. If it is used incorrectly, the solution may be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of cookies**. The maximum number of cookies that can be bought is equal to the minimum of the number of cookies and the amount of money. If this calculation is incorrect, the solution may be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. The input may contain edge cases, such as `N = 0` or `K = 0`. If these edge cases are not handled correctly, the solution may be incorrect.
5. **Incorrect use of variables**. The variables should be used correctly to avoid errors. For example, the variable `N` should be used to store the number of cookies, and the variable `K` should be used to store the amount of money. If these variables are used incorrectly, the solution may be incorrect.

1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be in incorrect format. For example, the input may contain a string instead of an integer. The developer should check the data type of the input and convert it to the correct type if necessary.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may make an off-by-one error when calculating the distance between two points or when checking if a point is within a certain range. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. This can also lead to incorrect results.
4. **Memory leak**. The developer may not release memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
5. **Race condition**. The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data. This can lead to race conditions, which can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
6. **Null pointer exception**. The developer may attempt to access a null pointer. This can cause the program to crash.
7. **Stack overflow**. The developer may write a recursive function that calls itself too many times. This can cause the stack to overflow, which can also cause the program to crash.
8. **Divide by zero error**. The developer may divide by zero. This can cause the program to crash.
9. **Arithmetic overflow**. The developer may perform an arithmetic operation that results in an overflow. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not specified clearly. For example, it is not clear whether the output should be a single integer or a list of integers.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The formula for calculating the total money Anshu has received is not correct. For example, the formula should take into account the fact that Anshu receives n Rs. on any nth day.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program may not be properly freeing up memory after it is finished using it. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
5. **Race conditions**. The program may not be properly synchronized, which can lead to race conditions. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or to crash.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may not be properly secure, which can allow attackers to exploit it to gain unauthorized access to the system.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully design their programs and test them thoroughly before deploying them to production.

HACKEREARTH gcd-5

Pain points:
1. **Using the wrong data type.** The input array is of type `int`, but the developer might accidentally use a different data type, such as `char` or `string`, which would lead to incorrect results.
2. **Not checking for boundary conditions.** The input array may be empty, or it may contain fewer than `N` elements, which the developer must check for before attempting to sort it.
3. **Using an incorrect sorting algorithm.** There are many different sorting algorithms available, and the developer must choose the one that is most appropriate for the problem at hand. Using an incorrect sorting algorithm could lead to incorrect results or inefficient performance.
4. **Not handling errors correctly.** The developer must handle errors that occur during sorting, such as a divide-by-zero error or an array out-of-bounds error. Not handling errors correctly could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
5. **Not testing the code thoroughly.** The developer must test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and works as expected. This includes testing for all possible input values and boundary conditions. Not testing the code thoroughly could lead to bugs that are difficult to find and fix.

Title:
HACKEREARTH lalit-and-kundu

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input consists of two integers, a and b. If we use an integer data type to store these values, we may get incorrect results. For example, if a = 1000000000 and b = 999999999, then the value of a - b will be 1, which is less than 10^-6. This will result in an incorrect answer.

To avoid this problem, we should use a larger data type, such as long long int.

**2. Using the wrong formula**

The probability that Lalit's number of questions solved is strictly more than Kundu's is given by the following formula:

```
P = (a - b) / (a + b)
```

However, some developers may mistakenly use the following formula:

```
P = a / (a + b)
```

This will result in an incorrect answer.

**3. Not handling the special case where a = b**

The formula for the probability only applies when a > b. If a = b, then the probability is 0.5. However, some developers may forget to handle this special case, and they may end up with an incorrect answer.

To avoid this problem, we should check if a = b before using the formula. If a = b, then we should return 0.5.

**4. Using floating-point arithmetic**

The formula for the probability involves division. When we perform division on floating-point numbers, we may get rounding errors. This can result in an incorrect answer.

To avoid this problem, we should use integer arithmetic instead of floating-point arithmetic. We can do this by multiplying both the numerator and denominator of the fraction by 10^6. This will ensure that the result is accurate to 6 decimal places.

**5. Not using the right programming language**

The problem can be solved in any programming language. However, some programming languages are better suited for this type of problem than others. For example, C++ is a good choice because it has a rich set of mathematical functions.

Here is a solution in C++:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
        int a, b;
        cin >> a >> b;
        cout << (a - b) / (a + b) << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}

Title:
HACKEREARTH roy-and-leds-6

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input is a list of integers, but the code is using `int` to store the values. This will cause the code to fail when the input contains a value that is not an integer.
2. **Incorrect loop condition**. The code uses a `while` loop to iterate over the input list, but the condition is incorrect. The condition should check if the current element is not equal to `-1`, not if it is equal to `0`.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The code calculates the number of seconds that each color is visible by dividing the total number of seconds by the corresponding period. However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the colors are not visible at the same time.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The code outputs the results in a list of integers, but the problem statement requires the output to be a list of strings.
5. **Missing error handling**. The code does not handle errors that may occur when reading the input or calculating the results. This could lead to the code crashing or producing incorrect results.

To avoid these problems, you should:

1. Use the correct variable type for the input data.
2. Use the correct loop condition.
3. Calculate the number of seconds that each color is visible correctly.
4. Output the results in the correct format.
5. Add error handling to the code.

ATCODER p02599 AtCoder Beginner Contest 174 - Range Set Query

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the number of balls or queries.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. For example, if you store the number of balls as an integer, you may overflow the integer when the number of balls is large. Similarly, if you store the number of queries as an integer, you may overflow the integer when the number of queries is large.

**2. Using the wrong data type for the colors of the balls.** This is another common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. For example, if you store the colors of the balls as integers, you may not be able to distinguish between different colors. Similarly, if you store the colors of the balls as strings, you may not be able to compare them efficiently.

**3. Using the wrong algorithm to solve the problem.** There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. The best algorithm to use depends on the specific constraints of the problem. For example, if the number of balls and queries is small, a simple brute-force algorithm may be sufficient. However, if the number of balls and queries is large, a more efficient algorithm, such as a divide-and-conquer algorithm, may be necessary.

**4. Making a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. For example, you may forget to initialize a variable, you may make a typo in the code, or you may use the wrong data type.

**5. Not handling all of the possible input cases.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. For example, you may not handle the case where the number of balls is zero, you may not handle the case where the number of queries is zero, or you may not handle the case where the colors of the balls are all the same.

Title:
ATCODER p02730 AtCoder Beginner Contest 159 - String Palindrome

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input string is a string of lowercase English letters. However, if the developer does not explicitly specify the data type of the input variable, the compiler may implicitly convert it to a different data type, such as an integer. This could lead to errors if the developer attempts to perform operations on the string that are not valid for integers.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The problem statement specifies that a strong palindrome must satisfy three conditions. The developer must ensure that their algorithm correctly checks for all three conditions. For example, a common mistake is to only check for the first condition (that the string is a palindrome). This would result in an incorrect answer for strings that satisfy the other two conditions but not the first condition.

**3. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

The problem statement specifies that the length of the input string must be an odd number between 3 and 99. The developer must ensure that their algorithm handles these boundary conditions correctly. For example, a common mistake is to assume that the input string will always have a length of at least 3 characters. This would result in an error if the input string is shorter than 3 characters.

**4. Using incorrect variable names**

The developer must use descriptive variable names that make it clear what the variables represent. This will help to prevent errors and make the code more readable. For example, a common mistake is to use the variable name `n` to represent the length of the input string. This could be confusing, as the variable name `n` is often used to represent the number of elements in an array.

**5. Not handling errors correctly**

The developer must ensure that their code handles errors correctly. For example, if the input string is not a valid string of lowercase English letters, the code should print an error message and exit. This will prevent the code from crashing and will help to ensure that the user is informed of the error.

**6. Not testing the code thoroughly**

The developer must test their code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. This includes testing the code with both valid and invalid input data. The developer should also test the code for different boundary conditions. By testing the code thoroughly, the developer can help to catch errors and ensure that the code is correct.

2. **Off-by-one error**. The formula for the maximum number of respondents subscribing to both newspapers is `min(A, B)`, not `min(A, B) + 1`.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The minimum number of respondents subscribing to both newspapers is `max(0, A + B - N)`, not `max(0, A + B)`.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be two integers separated by a space, not a single integer.
5. **Missing error handling**. The program should handle the case where `N` is less than or equal to 0, or where `A` or `B` is less than or equal to 0.
6. **Unnecessary code**. The program can be simplified by removing the unnecessary `min()` and `max()` functions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int N, A, B;
    scanf(" %d %d %d ", &N, &A, &B);

    int max = min(A, B);
    int min = max(0, A + B - N);

    printf("%d %d\n", max, min);

    return 0;
}

# Problem: AtCoder Beginner Contest 106 - AtCoder Express 2

# Solution:

N, M, Q = map(int, input().split())

trains = [list(map(int, input().split())) for i in range(M)]

queries = [list(map(int, input().split())) for i in range(Q)]

dp = [0] * (N + 1)

for train in trains:
    for i in range(train[0], train[1] + 1):
        dp[i] += 1

for query in queries:
    print(dp[query[1]] - dp[query[0] - 1])
```

## Possible Problems

1. The input format is not specified clearly. For example, it is not clear whether the input should be a list of lists or a list of strings.

Title:
ATCODER p03438 AtCoder Petrozavodsk Contest 001 - Two Arrays

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the arrays**

The input arrays are of type `int`, which can only store values up to 2^31-1. This means that if any of the elements in the arrays are larger than this, the program will overflow and produce incorrect results. To avoid this, you should use a data type that can store larger values, such as `long long`.

**2. Not handling the case where the arrays are not the same length**

The problem statement does not specify that the arrays must be the same length. However, if they are not the same length, the program will not be able to perform the operation correctly. To avoid this, you should check that the arrays are the same length before trying to perform the operation.

**3. Not handling the case where the arrays are empty**

The problem statement does not specify what should happen if the arrays are empty. However, if they are empty, the program will not be able to perform the operation correctly. To avoid this, you should check that the arrays are not empty before trying to perform the operation.

**4. Not handling the case where the arrays are all equal**

The problem statement does not specify what should happen if the arrays are all equal. However, if they are all equal, the program will not be able to perform the operation correctly. To avoid this, you should check that the arrays are not all equal before trying to perform the operation.

**5. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The problem statement does not specify how to solve the problem. However, there are a number of different algorithms that could be used. If you use an incorrect algorithm, the program will not be able to solve the problem correctly. To avoid this, you should carefully read the problem statement and choose an algorithm that is appropriate for the problem.

**6. Not handling errors correctly**

The program should handle errors correctly. This includes errors such as invalid input, out-of-memory errors, and divide-by-zero errors. If the program does not handle errors correctly, it may crash or produce incorrect results. To avoid this, you should use exception handling to catch and handle errors.

Title:
ATCODER p03597 AtCoder Beginner Contest 074 - Bichrome Cells

Pain points:
**1. Off-by-one errors**

The most common mistake when solving this problem is to forget to add 1 to the number of black squares. This is because the grid has N rows and N columns, so there are N^2 total squares. If we paint A squares white, then there will be N^2 - A squares that are painted black.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the number of white squares**

Another common mistake is to incorrectly calculate the number of white squares. The number of white squares is equal to the number of black squares plus 1. This is because the grid has N rows and N columns, so there are N^2 total squares. If we paint A squares white, then there will be N^2 - A squares that are painted black. Therefore, the number of white squares is N^2 - A + 1.

**3. Using the wrong data type**

When calculating the number of black squares, it is important to use the correct data type. If the number of black squares is large, then it may be necessary to use a long integer.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

It is important to handle edge cases when solving this problem. For example, if N is equal to 1, then there is only one square in the grid. If we paint this square white, then there will be no black squares.

**5. Using inefficient algorithms**

There are more efficient ways to solve this problem than the naive approach of simply counting the number of black squares. One efficient algorithm is to use a dynamic programming approach.

Title:
AIZU p00021 Parallelism

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a list of real numbers. If we use the wrong data type, such as integers, the program will not work correctly.

**2. Not handling floating-point errors correctly**

Floating-point numbers are not exact representations of real numbers. When we compare two floating-point numbers, we need to take into account the possibility of rounding errors.

**3. Not handling degenerate cases correctly**

The input data may contain degenerate cases, such as two points that are the same or two lines that are collinear. The program needs to handle these cases correctly.

**4. Not using the right algorithm**

There are several different algorithms that can be used to determine whether two lines are parallel. The program needs to use the right algorithm for the given data.

**5. Not testing the program thoroughly**

It is important to test the program thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly on all possible inputs. This includes testing for both valid and invalid input data.
Test inputs:
```
# 1. Using the wrong data type

Input:
1
0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 1.0

Title:
AIZU p00152 Bowling

Pain points:
**1. Input Format**

The input format is as follows:

```
m
score1
score2
...
scorem
```

The first line is the number of participants `m` (3 ≤ `m` ≤ 40). The following `m` lines are the participant information `scorei`. Each `scorei` is in the following format:

```
id s1 s2 ... sn
```

The first element is the student ID number `id` (0 ≤ `id` ≤ 9999), and the following elements are the number of pins knocked down in each throw `s1`, `s2`, ..., `sn` (0 ≤ `sj` ≤ 10).

**2. Output Format**

The output format is as follows:

```
id score
```

The student ID number `id` and the score `score` are separated by a single space. The output should be sorted in descending order of score, and if there is a tie, the output should be sorted in ascending order of `id`.

**3. Problems**

The following are some possible problems that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Invalid input format**. The input format is very strict, and any deviation from the format will cause the program to crash. For example, if the number of participants is not between 3 and 40, or if the student ID number is not between 0 and 9999, the program will crash.
* **Incorrect calculation of score**. The score is calculated based on the number of pins knocked down in each throw. If the number of pins knocked down is incorrect, the score will be incorrect.
* **Incorrect output format**. The output format is very strict, and any deviation from the format will cause the program to crash. For example, if the student ID number and score are not separated by a single space, or if the output is not sorted in descending order of score, the program will crash.

**4. Bugs**

The following are some possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Off-by-one errors**. The number of participants is `m`, but the index of the participant information is `i`. If the developer accidentally uses `i` instead of `m`, the program will crash.
* **Incorrect variable initialization**. The student ID number and score are both integers, but the developer accidentally initializes them as strings. This will cause the program to crash.
* **Incorrect logic**. The score is calculated based on the number of pins knocked down in each throw. If the developer accidentally uses the wrong formula to calculate the score, the program will output incorrect results.

**5. Solutions**

The following are some possible solutions to the problems mentioned above:

* **Validate the input format**. The program can first validate the input format to ensure that the input is correct. This can be done by checking the number of participants, the student ID number, and the number of pins knocked down.
* **Calculate the score correctly**. The program can use the following formula to calculate the score:

```
score = sum(pins_knocked_down)
```

where `pins_knocked_down` is the number of pins knocked down in each throw.
* **Format the output correctly**. The program can use the following code to format the output:

```
print(f"{id} {score}")
```

where `id` is the student ID number and `score` is the score.

**6. Conclusion**

The bowling problem is a challenging problem that can be solved using a variety of programming languages. However, there are a number of potential problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. By following the solutions outlined in this document, developers can avoid these problems and bugs and write a program that correctly solves the bowling problem.

Title:
AIZU p01206 Black Force

Pain points:
No

1. The input format is not very clear. It is not obvious what the meaning of each field is.
2. The problem statement is not very clear. It is not obvious what is meant by "the dam can store water up to the height of the lowest surrounding cell".
3. The problem is not very well-defined. For example, what happens if there is no cell with a height of at least C?
4. The solution is not very efficient. It takes O(H*W) time to find the lowest cell in each row and column, and then O(H*W*R) time to check if each inhabited cell is surrounded by cells with a height of at least C.
5. The solution does not handle the case where the required capacity is greater than the maximum height of any cell.

Here are some possible solutions to these problems:

1. The input format could be improved by using a more descriptive datatype for the map, such as a 2D array.
2. The problem statement could be improved by providing more examples and a more detailed explanation of the constraints.
3. The problem could be better-defined by specifying what happens if there is no cell with a height of at least C.
4. The solution could be made more efficient by using a more efficient algorithm for finding the lowest cell in each row and column. For example, the binary search algorithm could be used to find the lowest cell in each row in O(log H) time, and the same algorithm could be used to find the lowest cell in each column in O(log W) time.
5. The solution could be modified to handle the case where the required capacity is greater than the maximum height of any cell. For example, the solution could add a new cell with a height of C to the map, and then check if each inhabited cell is surrounded by cells with a height of at least C.

Title:
AIZU p01680 Everlasting -One-

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of mod operator.** The mod operator (%) should be used to ensure that the output is a multiple of 1000000007. For example, the following code would output 1000000009 instead of 32:

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
a = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
ans = 1
for i in range(n):
    ans = (ans * 2) % 1000000007
print(ans)
```

2. **Incorrect use of factorial.** The factorial function (math.factorial()) should only be used for positive integers. For example, the following code would raise a ValueError:

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
a = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
ans = math.factorial(n)
print(ans)
```

3. **Incorrect use of the binomial coefficient.** The binomial coefficient (math.comb()) should only be used for non-negative integers. For example, the following code would raise a ValueError:

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
a = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
ans = math.comb(n, m)
print(ans)
```

4. **Incorrect use of the fibonacci sequence.** The fibonacci sequence (fib()) should only be used for non-negative integers. For example, the following code would raise a ValueError:

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
a = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
ans = fib(n)
print(ans)
```

5. **Incorrect use of the prime factorization.** The prime factorization (primefac()) should only be used for positive integers. For example, the following code would raise a ValueError:

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
a = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
ans = primefac(n)
print(ans)

Title:
AIZU p01824 Surface Area of Cubes

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is a list of integers, where each integer represents the side length of a cube. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly calculate the surface area of the cubes.

**2. Incorrect calculation of surface area**

The surface area of a cube is calculated by multiplying the square of the side length by 6. If the side length is not a whole number, the program will need to round the value to the nearest integer before calculating the surface area.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When calculating the surface area of a cube, it is important to make sure that all of the sides are included. A common mistake is to forget to include the top or bottom of the cube. Another common mistake is to double-count the sides that are shared by two cubes.

**4. Memory errors**

If the input list is very large, the program may run out of memory. To avoid this, the program can be implemented using a dynamic array or a linked list.

**5. Floating-point errors**

When calculating the surface area of a cube, the program may need to use floating-point numbers. Floating-point numbers are subject to rounding errors, which can cause the calculated surface area to be inaccurate. To minimize these errors, the program can use a high precision floating-point number format.

Title:
AIZU p01959 Revenge of the Broken Door

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data structure**

The input data contains a list of cities and a list of roads. A common mistake is to use a list of lists to represent the roads. This can lead to problems when trying to find the shortest path between two cities, as the algorithm will need to iterate over all of the roads in the list, even if they are not connected to the two cities in question.

A better solution is to use a graph data structure to represent the roads. This will allow the algorithm to quickly find the shortest path between two cities, as it will only need to iterate over the roads that are connected to the two cities.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The shortest path problem is a well-known problem in computer science, and there are many different algorithms that can be used to solve it. A common mistake is to use an algorithm that is not designed for weighted graphs. This can lead to incorrect results, as the algorithm will not take into account the weights of the roads when finding the shortest path.

A better solution is to use an algorithm that is specifically designed for weighted graphs. This will ensure that the algorithm takes into account the weights of the roads when finding the shortest path, and will therefore produce the correct results.

**3. Not handling edge cases correctly**

The input data may contain edge cases that the algorithm must be able to handle correctly. For example, the input data may contain a road that has a negative weight. If the algorithm does not handle this edge case correctly, it may produce incorrect results.

A better solution is to test the algorithm on a variety of input data, including input data that contains edge cases. This will help to ensure that the algorithm is able to handle all of the possible edge cases correctly.

**4. Not using efficient data structures and algorithms**

The shortest path problem can be solved using a variety of data structures and algorithms. Some data structures and algorithms are more efficient than others. A common mistake is to use a data structure or algorithm that is not as efficient as it could be.

A better solution is to use a data structure and algorithm that is as efficient as possible. This will help to improve the performance of the algorithm and reduce the amount of time it takes to find the shortest path.

**5. Not debugging the algorithm correctly**

Once the algorithm has been implemented, it is important to debug the algorithm to ensure that it is working correctly. This can be done by testing the algorithm on a variety of input data, including input data that contains edge cases.

A better solution is to use a debugger to help debug the algorithm. This will allow the developer to see exactly what the algorithm is doing and to identify any errors that may be present.

Title:
AIZU p02246 15 Puzzle

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be a 4x4 array of integers, with the empty space represented by 0. If the input is not in the correct format, the program will not be able to solve the puzzle correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer, representing the fewest number of steps required to solve the puzzle. If the output is not in the correct format, the program will not be accepted by the judge.
3. **Incorrect puzzle solution**. The program should output the fewest number of steps required to solve the puzzle. If the program outputs a solution that is not the fewest number of steps possible, the program will not be accepted by the judge.
4. **Infinite loop**. The program may enter an infinite loop if it is not properly designed. This can happen if the program does not check for certain conditions, such as when the puzzle is already solved.
5. **Memory leak**. The program may leak memory if it is not properly designed. This can happen if the program does not free up memory that is no longer needed.
6. **Stack overflow**. The program may stack overflow if it is not properly designed. This can happen if the program calls too many recursive functions or if the functions do not return values properly.
7. **Incorrect data type**. The program may use incorrect data types for certain variables. This can lead to errors in the program's logic and incorrect results.
8. **Off-by-one error**. The program may make an off-by-one error when calculating the number of steps required to solve the puzzle. This can happen if the program does not account for the fact that the empty space can move around the board.
9. **Incorrect algorithm**. The program may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the puzzle. This can lead to the program taking longer than necessary to solve the puzzle or to the program not being able to solve the puzzle at all.
10. **Other bugs**. There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving the 15-puzzle problem. These bugs can range from minor typos to major design flaws. It is important to be aware of these potential bugs and to take steps to avoid them when writing a program to solve the 15-puzzle problem.
