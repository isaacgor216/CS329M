Title:
CODECHEF cw1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly handling the input.** The input may be in a different format than expected, or it may contain invalid data. For example, the input may contain a DNA sequence that contains characters other than A, T, G, and C. The developer must make sure to handle the input correctly in order to avoid errors.
2. **Incorrectly implementing the algorithm.** The algorithm for removing the enzymes from the DNA sequence is fairly straightforward, but it is important to make sure that it is implemented correctly. For example, the developer must make sure to remove all occurrences of the enzyme from the DNA sequence, and they must also make sure to reform the DNA sequence after each removal.
3. **Incorrectly handling the output.** The output of the program should be a single line containing the final reformed DNA sequence. The developer must make sure to format the output correctly and to avoid any errors.
4. **Using inefficient algorithms.** The algorithm for removing the enzymes from the DNA sequence can be implemented in a variety of ways. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. The developer should choose an efficient algorithm in order to minimize the running time of the program.
5. **Not handling errors gracefully.** The program should be able to handle errors gracefully. For example, the program should be able to handle the case where the input is invalid. The program should also be able to handle the case where the DNA sequence is completely consumed.

Title:
CODECHEF icq1

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type:** The input string is a binary string, so it should be stored as a `String` or `StringBuilder`. Using an integer data type will result in incorrect results.
2. **Incorrectly counting the number of occurrences:** The factor `01` can occur in a string in two ways: as a single substring or as two consecutive substrings. It is important to count both occurrences.
3. **Off-by-one errors:** When counting the number of occurrences, it is easy to make a mistake and count one occurrence too many or too few. Carefully check your code to make sure that you are getting the correct answer.
4. **Using inefficient algorithms:** There are more efficient ways to count the number of occurrences of a substring in a string than a simple linear search. Consider using a hash table or a suffix array.

Title:
CODECHEF mqry

Pain points:
**1. Index out of bound error**

The input list may contain negative numbers. So, when we calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum element in a given range, we need to make sure that the indices are valid. If an index is out of bound, we should raise an error.

**2. Incorrect calculation of maximum and minimum element**

We need to calculate the maximum and minimum element in a given range. We can do this by iterating over the elements in the range and keeping track of the maximum and minimum element seen so far.

**3. Incorrect output format**

The output should be a single integer, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum element in the given range. We should make sure that the output is formatted correctly.

**4. Missing error handling**

We should handle errors that may occur during the execution of the program. For example, if the input is not valid, we should raise an error.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type.** The input data is given as a string, but the developer may accidentally parse it as an integer. This would result in a wrong answer.
2. **Incorrect algorithm.** The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. This could lead to a wrong answer or a timeout.
3. **Off-by-one error.** The developer may accidentally miscount the number of edges or vertices in the graph. This would result in a wrong answer.
4. **Memory leak.** The developer may not properly free the memory allocated for the graph data structure. This could lead to a memory leak and eventually a crash.
5. **Synchronization error.** The developer may not properly synchronize access to the graph data structure between multiple threads. This could lead to a race condition and incorrect results.
6. **Exception handling error.** The developer may not properly handle exceptions that are thrown during the execution of the program. This could lead to a crash or incorrect results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1019_B. The hat

Pain points:
### Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading in the data. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will likely crash.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format for this problem is also very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when printing the answer. For example, if you forget to include the exclamation point (!) before the student ID, the program will likely crash.
* **Off-by-one errors:** This problem involves a lot of modulo arithmetic, and it's easy to make a mistake when calculating the indices of students. For example, if you forget to add 1 to the student ID when calculating the index of the student across from them, the program will likely crash.
* **Infinite loops:** This problem can be solved using a brute-force approach, which involves asking questions about every possible student. However, if you're not careful, you can end up in an infinite loop. For example, if you keep asking questions about the same student, the program will never terminate.
* **Memory leaks:** This problem involves a lot of data structures, and it's easy to create a memory leak if you're not careful. For example, if you don't delete a data structure when you're finished with it, the program will continue to use up memory until it crashes.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* **Be careful when reading in the input data.** Make sure to check for errors, and make sure that the data is in the correct format.
* **Be careful when printing the output data.** Make sure to follow the correct output format, and make sure that the data is correct.
* **Check your work carefully.** Make sure that you've accounted for all possible cases, and that your code is correct.
* **Use a debugger to find errors.** If you're having trouble finding a bug, use a debugger to step through your code and see where it's going wrong.
* **Use a memory profiler to find memory leaks.** If you're having trouble with memory leaks, use a memory profiler to track down where the memory is being allocated and released.

CODEFORCES 1042_A. Benches

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific. Make sure that you read the problem statement carefully and parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of people on one bench**. The maximum number of people on one bench is the sum of the initial number of people on each bench plus the number of additional people. Make sure that you add these two numbers correctly.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of people on one bench**. The minimum number of people on one bench is the maximum number of people on one bench divided by the number of benches. Make sure that you divide these two numbers correctly.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. When calculating the maximum or minimum number of people on one bench, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. Make sure that you check your calculations carefully to avoid this type of error.
5. **Using the wrong data type**. The input and output for this problem are all integers. Make sure that you use the correct data type for your variables to avoid any errors.

2. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program may be incorrect, which may result in the program producing incorrect output. For example, if the program does not account for all possible cases, it may produce incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors occur when the program counts one more or one less than it should. For example, if the program counts the number of candies in the box incorrectly, it may produce incorrect output.
4. **Memory errors.** The program may run out of memory, which may result in the program crashing. For example, if the program tries to allocate too much memory, it may run out of memory and crash.
5. **Timeout errors.** The program may take too long to run, which may result in the program being timed out. For example, if the program is too inefficient, it may take too long to run and be timed out.
6. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program may contain security vulnerabilities, which may allow attackers to exploit the program. For example, if the program does not properly sanitize user input, attackers may be able to inject malicious code into the program.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1106_D. Lunar New Year and a Wander

Pain points:
**1. The input format is incorrect**

The input format is `n m`, where `n` is the number of nodes and `m` is the number of edges. However, some submissions may have the format `n m e`, where `e` is the number of edges. This will cause the program to crash.

**2. The graph is not connected**

The problem statement states that the graph is connected. However, some submissions may create a graph that is not connected. This will cause the program to output an incorrect answer.

**3. The output format is incorrect**

The output format is a sequence of `n` integers, where each integer represents a node in the graph. However, some submissions may output a sequence of `n+1` integers, where the first integer is the number of nodes in the graph. This will cause the program to crash.

**4. The program uses an incorrect algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a simple breadth-first search algorithm. However, some submissions may use a more complex algorithm that is not necessary for solving the problem. This will cause the program to run slower than necessary.

**5. The program has a bug**

Even if the program follows the correct algorithm, it may still have a bug that causes it to output an incorrect answer. This could be due to a mistake in the code, or a problem with the input data.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and make sure that your program is correct. You should also test your program on a variety of input data to make sure that it works correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1133_E. K Balanced Teams

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect sorting**. The input is sorted in ascending order, but the output should be sorted in descending order.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum possible total number of students**. The maximum possible total number of students is the minimum of the number of students and the number of teams.
3. **Incorrect handling of ties**. If there are multiple students with the same programming skill, they should all be included in the same team.
4. **Incorrect handling of overflows**. The programming skill of each student is an integer, so the maximum possible total number of students is also an integer.
5. **Incorrect use of Python's built-in functions**. The Python function `max()` returns the largest element in a list, but it does not guarantee that the list is sorted. The Python function `sorted()` sorts a list in ascending order, but it does not guarantee that the list is unique.
6. **Incorrect use of Python's data structures**. The Python list data structure is not efficient for storing large amounts of data. The Python set data structure is more efficient for storing unique elements.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. Use a stable sorting algorithm to sort the input in ascending order.
2. Use the formula `min(n, k)` to calculate the maximum possible total number of students.
3. Use a priority queue to store the students with the highest programming skill.
4. Use a hash table to store the students with the same programming skill.
5. Use the Python function `sorted()` to sort the list of students in descending order.
6. Use the Python function `set()` to create a set of unique students.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1154_B. Make Them Equal

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a list of integers, so the developer should use an integer data type to store the values. Using the wrong data type, such as a string or a float, could lead to incorrect results.

**2. Not initializing the variables**

The developer should initialize all variables before using them. If a variable is not initialized, it will contain garbage data, which could lead to incorrect results.

**3. Using the wrong formula**

The formula for finding the minimum non-negative integer value D is:

```
D = (max(a) - min(a)) / 2
```

The developer should make sure to use the correct formula, otherwise the results will be incorrect.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

The developer should handle edge cases, such as when the input data is empty or when all of the values in the input data are the same. If these edge cases are not handled, the program could crash or produce incorrect results.

**5. Using incorrect logic**

The developer should use correct logic to solve the problem. For example, the developer should not assume that the input data is always sorted.

**6. Not testing the code**

The developer should test the code to ensure that it is working correctly. This can be done by creating test cases and running the code on them. Testing the code will help to identify bugs and fix them before the code is deployed to production.
Test inputs:

2. **Incorrect array indexing.** The array indices in the program may not be correct. For example, the program may try to access an element of the array that does not exist. This can cause the program to crash or to output incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the subsegment weight.** The weight of a subsegment is calculated incorrectly. For example, the program may not take into account the fact that the subsegment may contain multiple occurrences of the same element. This can cause the program to output incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the total weight of the partition.** The total weight of the partition is calculated incorrectly. For example, the program may not take into account the fact that the partition may contain multiple subsegments of the same weight. This can cause the program to output incorrect results.

```
n, t = map(int, input().split())
t_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

2. **Incorrect use of functions.** The following code uses the `sum()` function to calculate the expected value of the number of crosswords Adilbek solves. However, this function does not take into account the fact that Adilbek may not solve all of the crosswords.

```
expected_value = sum(p * i for i, p in enumerate(p_list))
```

3. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The following code uses a list to store the probability that Adilbek will solve each crossword. However, this data structure is not efficient for storing large amounts of data.

```
p_list = [0] * n
```

4. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** The following code uses a brute-force algorithm to calculate the expected value of the number of crosswords Adilbek solves. This algorithm is inefficient, as it does not take into account the fact that Adilbek may not solve all of the crosswords.

```

    for j in range(n):
        if t_list[i] + t_list[j] <= T:
            expected_value += 1
```

5. **Incorrect use of mathematical operations.** The following code uses the `mod()` function to calculate the expected value of the number of crosswords Adilbek solves. However, this function does not take into account the fact that the expected value may be greater than 10^9 + 7.

```
expected_value = expected_value % (10**9 + 7)
```

6. **Incorrect use of formatting.** The following code uses the `print()` function to print the expected value of the number of crosswords Adilbek solves. However, this function does not take into account the fact that the expected value may be a floating-point number.

```
print(expected_value)
```

7. **Incorrect use of comments.** The following code uses comments to explain the code. However, the comments are not helpful, as they do not provide any useful information.

### Possible Problems

* **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the number of cities and workers are not separated by a space, or the material that is familiarized by the workers is not in the correct format.
* **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed. For example, the two integers that represent the cities that are connected by a road are not separated by a space, or the worker does not construct any road, but the output is not "0 0".
* **Incorrect logic**. The algorithm that is used to solve the problem is incorrect. For example, the algorithm does not consider all possible combinations of roads that can be constructed, or the algorithm does not ensure that any pair of cities are connected by a sequence of constructed roads.
* **Memory limit exceeded**. The algorithm that is used to solve the problem uses too much memory. This can happen if the algorithm stores a large amount of data in memory, or if the algorithm uses a recursive approach that recurses too deeply.
* **Time limit exceeded**. The algorithm that is used to solve the problem takes too long to run. This can happen if the algorithm is too complex, or if the algorithm uses a brute-force approach that tries every possible combination of roads.

### Possible Bugs

* **Off-by-one errors**. The algorithm may incorrectly count the number of cities, the number of workers, or the number of roads that can be constructed. This can lead to incorrect results.
* **Incorrect data structures**. The algorithm may use data structures that are not appropriate for the problem. For example, the algorithm may use a linked list to store the list of cities, but a hash table would be a more efficient data structure.
* **Incorrect logic flow**. The algorithm may not be correctly implemented. For example, the algorithm may not check if all pairs of cities are connected by a sequence of constructed roads.
* **Incorrect variable initialization**. The algorithm may not initialize variables correctly. For example, the algorithm may not initialize the list of cities to be empty.
* **Incorrect error handling**. The algorithm may not handle errors correctly. For example, the algorithm may not handle the case where the input format is incorrect.

## How to avoid these problems

Title:
CODEFORCES 1381_A1. Prefix Flip (Easy Version)

Pain points:
**1. Incorrectly counting the number of operations needed.**

The most common mistake is to incorrectly count the number of operations needed to transform `a` into `b`. One common mistake is to forget that the order of the bits in the prefix is reversed when it is flipped. For example, if `a` is `001011` and you flip the prefix of length 3, the resulting string is `011011`, not `110011`.

Another common mistake is to forget that you can only flip a prefix of length at most `n`. For example, if `n` is 5 and you try to flip the prefix of length 6, the operation will be invalid.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm.**

There are a few different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. The most common algorithm is a brute-force approach that simply tries all possible combinations of prefixes to flip. This algorithm is very inefficient, and it is only feasible for small values of `n`.

A more efficient algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that builds up a table of the minimum number of operations needed to transform `a` into `b` for prefixes of all possible lengths. This algorithm is much more efficient than the brute-force approach, and it can be used to solve the problem for large values of `n`.

**3. Incorrect input handling.**

Another common mistake is to incorrectly handle the input. One common mistake is to forget to check that the input is valid. For example, you should check that `n` is a positive integer and that `a` and `b` are binary strings of length `n`.

Another common mistake is to incorrectly parse the input. For example, you should make sure that you correctly convert the input to a binary string.

**4. Incorrect output formatting.**

The output of your program should be a list of integers, where each integer represents the length of the prefix that is flipped in the corresponding operation. The integers should be separated by spaces.

You should also make sure that the output is correctly aligned. For example, if the first operation flips a prefix of length 3, the output should be `3`. If the second operation flips a prefix of length 5, the output should be `5`.

CODEFORCES 1401_A. Distance and Axis

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is "t n k". If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will output incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the absolute difference**. The absolute difference between two numbers is the distance between them on the number line. To calculate the absolute difference, you can use the following formula: |x - y| = x - y if x > y, and |x - y| = y - x if x < y.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of steps**. The minimum number of steps to make point B exist is the smallest number of steps that can be taken to move point A to a position where the absolute difference between the distance from O to B and the distance from A to B is equal to k. To calculate the minimum number of steps, you can use the following algorithm:
    1. Initialize a variable `steps` to 0.
    2. While the absolute difference between the distance from O to B and the distance from A to B is not equal to k, do the following:
        * If the distance from O to B is greater than the distance from A to B, then move point A to the left by 1 unit.
        * If the distance from O to B is less than the distance from A to B, then move point A to the right by 1 unit.
        * Increment the variable `steps` by 1.
    3. Return the value of the variable `steps`.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format for this problem is "steps". If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly output the results and will generate an error.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

* Make sure that you understand the input format and the output format for this problem.
* Use the correct formula to calculate the absolute difference between two numbers.
* Use the correct algorithm to calculate the minimum number of steps.
* Make sure that your output format is correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1424_H. Lookup Tables

Pain points:
1. **Wrong implementation of the bitwise AND operation.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The bitwise AND operation is performed by taking each bit of the two operands and ANDing them together. For example, if the two operands are `0101` and `1010`, the result will be `0000`.
2. **Using the wrong data type for the lookup tables.** The lookup tables must be able to store all of the possible values that can be returned by the function F. In this problem, the values of F are all 16-bit numbers, so the lookup tables must also be 16-bit numbers.
3. **Using an incorrect number of bits for the lookup tables.** The number of bits in the lookup tables must be equal to the number of bits in the input values. In this problem, the input values are all 2K-bit numbers, so the lookup tables must also be 2K-bit numbers.
4. **Not considering all of the possible inputs to the function F.** The function F can be called with any 2K-bit number as an input. It is important to make sure that the lookup tables are able to handle all of these possible inputs.
5. **Using incorrect values for the lookup tables.** The values in the lookup tables must be chosen carefully in order to ensure that the function F returns the correct results. It is important to make sure that the values in the lookup tables are consistent with each other and that they do not overlap.
6. **Not handling errors correctly.** The function F may return an error if it is called with an invalid input. It is important to make sure that the code handles these errors correctly.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. **Use a reliable reference implementation of the bitwise AND operation.** There are many online resources available that can help you with this.
2. **Choose the correct data type for the lookup tables.** The data type of the lookup tables must be able to store all of the possible values that can be returned by the function F.
3. **Use the correct number of bits for the lookup tables.** The number of bits in the lookup tables must be equal to the number of bits in the input values.
4. **Consider all of the possible inputs to the function F.** The function F can be called with any 2K-bit number as an input. It is important to make sure that the lookup tables are able to handle all of these possible inputs.
5. **Use correct values for the lookup tables.** The values in the lookup tables must be chosen carefully in order to ensure that the function F returns the correct results. It is important to make sure that the values in the lookup tables are consistent with each other and that they do not overlap.
6. **Handle errors correctly.** The function F may return an error if it is called with an invalid input. It is important to make sure that the code handles these errors correctly.

CODEFORCES 1546_C. AquaMoon and Strange Sort

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem statement is not very clear, so it is important to make sure that you understand what is being asked. In this case, the problem is asking you to find a sequence of operations that will make the numbers written on the T-shirts non-decreasing and all friends have a direction of right at the end.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution to this problem is not very difficult, but it is important to make sure that you implement it correctly. In particular, you need to be careful about the order in which you swap the friends and the directions of the friends.
3. **Incorrect test cases.** It is important to test your solution on a variety of test cases, including cases where the numbers are not all distinct and cases where the friends are not all initially facing right.
4. **Incorrect runtime analysis.** The runtime of your solution should be O(n), where n is the number of friends. If your solution is not O(n), then it is likely that you are making a mistake somewhere.
5. **Incorrect memory usage.** Your solution should not use more than O(n) memory, where n is the number of friends. If your solution uses more than O(n) memory, then it is likely that you are making a mistake somewhere.

**Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:**

1. **Read the problem statement carefully and make sure that you understand what is being asked.** If you are not sure about something, ask a question.
2. **Write out a detailed solution plan before you start coding.** This will help you to avoid mistakes and make sure that your solution is correct.
3. **Test your solution on a variety of test cases, including cases where the numbers are not all distinct and cases where the friends are not all initially facing right.** This will help you to catch any errors in your solution.
4. **Analyze the runtime and memory usage of your solution.** Make sure that your solution is O(n) in time and O(n) in space.
5. **Debug your solution using a debugger.** This can help you to find errors that are difficult to find by other means.

Title:
CODEFORCES 193_E. Fibonacci Number

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is an integer, so the developer should use the `int` data type to store it. However, if the developer uses a smaller data type, such as `char` or `short`, the program will overflow and give incorrect results.

**2. Using the wrong modulo operator**

The problem states that the list of Fibonacci numbers is modulo 1013. This means that when calculating the next number in the list, the developer should use the `%` modulo operator. However, if the developer uses the `/` division operator, the program will give incorrect results.

**3. Using an incorrect formula**

The formula for calculating the nth Fibonacci number is `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`. However, if the developer uses an incorrect formula, the program will give incorrect results.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

When counting the number of Fibonacci numbers in the list, the developer is likely to make an off-by-one error. This means that the developer will count one number too many or one number too few.

**5. Using an infinite loop**

The Fibonacci sequence is an infinite sequence, so the developer should be careful not to create an infinite loop in their program. This can be done by using a break statement or by checking the value of the nth Fibonacci number to see if it is equal to the given number.
Test inputs:
```
#include <iostream>

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not correctly parsed, which may result in incorrect output. For example, if the input is "2\n1 2", the program will incorrectly parse the input as "2 1 2", which is not a valid input.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem is not correctly generated, which may result in incorrect evaluation. For example, if the output is "1 2 3", the program will incorrectly evaluate the output as "1 2 3 4", which is not a valid output.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem is incorrect, which may result in incorrect output. For example, if the algorithm assumes that all the ones are in the cells that lie below the main diagonal, the program will incorrectly output the following solution:
```
1
1 1 2

```
This algorithm will not work because it does not take into account the fact that some students may not be able to find a room with enough wash basins.
4. The algorithm is inefficient. For example, the following algorithm is inefficient:
```
def solve():
  n, m = map(int, input().split())
  a = list(map(int, input().split()))
  res = 0
  for i in range(m):
    for j in range(n // a[i] + 1):
      res += j * (n // a[i] - j) * a[i]
  return res

if __name__ == "__main__":

CODEFORCES 404_D. Minesweeper 1D

Pain points:
** Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs That a Developer May Encounter When Solving This Problem **

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific. It requires a string of characters without spaces, containing only characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2". If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to parse the input and will produce an incorrect output.
2. **Incorrectly counting the number of ways to fill the empty cells**. The number of ways to fill the empty cells is equal to the product of the number of ways to fill each empty cell. For example, if there are two empty cells, the number of ways to fill them is equal to the number of ways to fill the first empty cell multiplied by the number of ways to fill the second empty cell. It is important to make sure that you are correctly counting the number of ways to fill each empty cell.
3. **Modulo arithmetic**. The answer to this problem is a very large number, so it is necessary to use modulo arithmetic to ensure that the answer is correct. Modulo arithmetic is a mathematical operation that takes two numbers and returns the remainder when the first number is divided by the second number. For example, 10 mod 7 is 3, because 10 divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 3. It is important to make sure that you are correctly using modulo arithmetic in your solution.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that occurs when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to incorrect results, such as the program counting the number of empty cells incorrectly. It is important to be careful to avoid off-by-one errors in your code.
5. **Other logical errors**. There are a number of other logical errors that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These errors can include incorrect variable initialization, incorrect logic, and incorrect use of functions. It is important to carefully check your code for logical errors before submitting it.

CODEFORCES 550_A. Two Substrings

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly checking for overlapping substrings.** The most common mistake is to check for overlapping substrings by simply looking for two occurrences of the substrings "AB" and "BA" in the string. This is incorrect because it is possible for the two substrings to overlap, in which case the answer would be "NO" even though the two substrings are present in the string.
2. **Incorrectly counting the number of occurrences of the substrings.** Another common mistake is to incorrectly count the number of occurrences of the substrings "AB" and "BA" in the string. This can happen if the two substrings are not distinct, or if one of the substrings is a substring of the other.
3. **Incorrectly handling the case where the string is empty.** The string can be empty, in which case the answer is "NO" even if the two substrings are present in the string.
4. **Incorrectly handling the case where the string contains only one of the substrings.** The string can contain only one of the substrings, in which case the answer is "NO" even if the other substring is present in the string.
5. **Incorrectly handling the case where the string contains both of the substrings, but they overlap.** The string can contain both of the substrings, but they can overlap, in which case the answer is "NO" even though the two substrings are present in the string.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check for overlapping substrings, correctly count the number of occurrences of the substrings, handle the case where the string is empty, handle the case where the string contains only one of the substrings, and handle the case where the string contains both of the substrings, but they overlap.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specified in the problem statement is not followed. For example, the output may contain extra spaces or newlines.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the modulo sum**. The modulo sum of a subsequence is calculated incorrectly. For example, the sum of the elements in the subsequence is not correctly divided by `m`.
4. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator**. The modulo operator is used incorrectly. For example, the modulo operator is used to divide by a number that is not coprime to `m`.
5. **Incorrect use of the `%` operator**. The `%` operator is used incorrectly. For example, the `%` operator is used to divide by a number that is not positive.
6. **Incorrect use of the `/` operator**. The `/` operator is used incorrectly. For example, the `/` operator is used to divide by a number that is zero.
7. **Incorrect use of the `+` and `-` operators**. The `+` and `-` operators are used incorrectly. For example, the `+` operator is used to add two numbers that are of different types.
8. **Incorrect use of the `&&` and `||` operators**. The `&&` and `||` operators are used incorrectly. For example, the `&&` operator is used to check if two boolean expressions are both true, when one of them is false.

CODEFORCES 620_D. Professor GukiZ and Two Arrays

Pain points:
```
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is not very strict. For example, you can write `5` instead of `5 0` to indicate that the array `a` has 5 elements. However, some developers may not be aware of this and write the input in a different format, which will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format for this problem is also not very strict. For example, you can write `1` instead of `1\n` to indicate that the minimum value is 1. However, some developers may not be aware of this and write the output in a different format, which will cause the program to produce incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. This problem involves a lot of calculations with arrays. It is very easy to make a mistake and add or subtract one element from an array by mistake. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The logic for this problem is not very complicated, but it is still possible to make mistakes. For example, you might forget to check if an array is empty before trying to access an element from it. This will cause the program to crash.
5. **Memory errors**. This problem involves a lot of data. If you are not careful, you may run out of memory and the program will crash.
6. **Timeout errors**. This problem requires you to find the optimal solution in a limited amount of time. If your program is too slow, it will time out and you will not receive any points.

CODEFORCES 66_A. Petya and Java

Pain points:
1. **Using the wrong data type.** The problem states that the input number is a positive integer, but the code below tries to convert it to a `byte` type, which can only store negative numbers. This will cause an error.

```
n = int(input())
b = byte(n)
print(type(b))
```

2. **Using the wrong comparison operator.** The problem states that the input number is a positive integer, but the code below compares it to 0 using the `==` operator. This will return `True` if the number is 0, which is not what we want.

```
n = int(input())
if n == 0:
    print("byte")
else:
    print("BigInteger")
```

3. **Using the wrong loop condition.** The problem states that the input number is no more than 100 digits long, but the code below uses a `while` loop that iterates over the entire number. This will cause an infinite loop if the number is longer than 100 digits.

```
n = int(input())
while n > 0:
    n //= 10
```

4. **Not handling the edge cases.** The problem states that the input number can't be represented as an empty string, but the code below doesn't handle this case. If the input is an empty string, the code will throw an error.

```
n = input()
if n == "":
    raise ValueError("Input can't be an empty string")
```

5. **Using inefficient algorithms.** The problem states that the input number is no more than 100 digits long, but the code below uses a `for` loop to iterate over the entire number. This is inefficient, as it could be solved in O(1) time.

```
n = int(input())
for i in range(len(n)):
    if n[i] != "0":
        print("BigInteger")
        break
else:
    print("byte")

CODEFORCES 690_F1. Tree of Life (easy)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of lifelines.** A lifeline is a path of length 2, so it consists of two edges. However, some developers may mistakenly count the number of edges in the tree instead of the number of lifelines. This will result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Not handling the case where the input tree is not a tree.** The problem statement states that the input tree must be a tree. However, some developers may not check this condition and may assume that the input tree is always a tree. This will result in an incorrect answer or a runtime error.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm to count the number of lifelines.** There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to count the number of lifelines in a tree. Some developers may use an incorrect algorithm, which will result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Not handling the case where the input tree is a forest.** The problem statement states that the input tree must be a tree. However, some developers may not check this condition and may assume that the input tree is always a tree. This will result in an incorrect answer or a runtime error.
5. **Using an incorrect data structure to store the tree.** The tree can be represented using a variety of different data structures. Some developers may use an incorrect data structure, which will result in an incorrect answer or a runtime error.
6. **Not handling the case where the input tree is too large.** The problem statement states that the input tree must have at most 10000 vertices. However, some developers may not check this condition and may assume that the input tree is always small. This will result in a runtime error.
7. **Not handling the case where the input tree is malformed.** The problem statement states that the input tree must be well-formed. However, some developers may not check this condition and may assume that the input tree is always well-formed. This will result in an incorrect answer or a runtime error.
Test inputs:

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input may not be correct, which may lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program may crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the programmer miscounts by one. For example, if the programmer expects to find five elements in an array, but there are only four, the program may crash.
4. **Indexing errors**. Indexing errors occur when the programmer accesses an element of an array or list using an incorrect index. For example, if the programmer tries to access the fifth element of an array that only has four elements, the program may crash.
5. **Logic errors**. Logic errors occur when the programmer makes a mistake in the logic of the program. For example, if the programmer tries to divide by zero, the program may crash.
6. **Memory errors**. Memory errors occur when the programmer allocates too much or too little memory for the program. For example, if the programmer allocates too little memory for an array, the program may crash.
7. **Synchronization errors**. Synchronization errors occur when multiple threads try to access the same data at the same time. For example, if two threads try to update the same variable at the same time, the program may crash.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities occur when the programmer makes a mistake that allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the program. For example, if the programmer allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the program, the attacker may be able to take control of the program.

CODEFORCES 735_E. Ostap and Tree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is:

```
n k
u1 v1
u2 v2
...
```

where `n` and `k` are the number of vertices and the maximum allowed distance to the nearest black vertex, respectively. `u1` and `v1` are the indices of the vertices connected by the first edge, and so on.

If the input format is incorrect, the following error may occur:

```
Error: Expected 'n k', got '2 0 1 2'
```

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer, which is the remainder of division of the number of ways to paint the tree by 109 + 7.

If the output format is incorrect, the following error may occur:

```
Error: Expected integer, got 'abc'
```

**3. Incorrect calculation of the number of ways to paint the tree**

The number of ways to paint the tree is the number of ways to choose which vertices to paint black, such that from any vertex u there is at least one black vertex v at distance no more than k.

To calculate this number, we can use the following formula:

```
N = (n + k)! / (k! * (n - k)!)
```

where `N` is the number of ways to paint the tree, `n` is the number of vertices, and `k` is the maximum allowed distance to the nearest black vertex.

If the calculation of the number of ways to paint the tree is incorrect, the following error may occur:

```
Runtime error: Divide by zero
```

**4. Incorrect modulo operation**

The number of ways to paint the tree can be large, so we need to perform the modulo operation to get the remainder of division by 109 + 7.

If the modulo operation is incorrect, the following error may occur:

```
Runtime error: Modulo operation overflow
```

**5. Other errors**

There are a number of other errors that can occur when solving this problem, such as:

* Index out of bounds errors
* Syntax errors
* Logical errors

By carefully checking your code and following the instructions carefully, you can avoid these errors.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not correctly parsed, which may cause the program to crash or output incorrect results. For example, if the input is `10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10`, the program may crash because it expects the first line to contain a single integer.
2. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect, which may cause the program to output incorrect results. For example, a naive algorithm for finding the minimum cost of tickets would be to try every possible combination of tickets, which would be very inefficient.
3. **Incorrect data type.** The data type used to store the input data may be incorrect, which may cause the program to crash or output incorrect results. For example, if the input is a list of integers, but the program stores the data as a list of strings, the program may crash when it tries to perform arithmetic operations on the data.
4. **Incorrect variable scope.** The scope of variables used in the program may be incorrect, which may cause the program to crash or output incorrect results. For example, if a variable is declared inside a function, it will not be accessible outside of the function.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The program may not handle errors correctly, which may cause the program to crash or output incorrect results. For example, if the program tries to divide by zero, it should raise an exception instead of crashing.
6. **Incorrect unit testing.** The program's unit tests may not be comprehensive or correct, which may cause the program to contain bugs that are not caught by the unit tests. For example, a unit test that only tests the happy path may not catch a bug that occurs in the error path.
7. **Incorrect integration testing.** The program's integration tests may not be comprehensive or correct, which may cause the program to contain bugs that are not caught by the integration tests. For example, an integration test that only tests the program with a few small inputs may not catch a bug that occurs when the program is used with large inputs.
8. **Incorrect deployment.** The program may be deployed incorrectly, which may cause the program to crash or output incorrect results. For example, the program may be deployed to a server that does not have the correct dependencies installed.

Title:
CODEFORCES 850_B. Arpa and a list of numbers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be exactly as specified in the problem statement. If the input format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of gcd**. The gcd of a set of numbers is the largest integer that divides all of the numbers in the set. To calculate the gcd, you can use the Euclidean algorithm.
3. **Incorrect application of the deletion and increment operations**. The deletion operation removes a number from the list and the increment operation increases a number by 1. Make sure that you are applying these operations correctly to minimize the cost.
4. **Incorrect output**. The output should be a single integer that represents the minimum possible cost to make the list good. Make sure that your output is formatted correctly.
5. **Other bugs**. There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. Some common bugs include:
    * Off-by-one errors
    * Array out-of-bounds errors
    * Memory leaks
    * Incorrect variable initialization
    * Incorrect data type conversions
    * Logical errors

Title:
CODEFORCES 873_D. Merge Sort

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the merge sort algorithm.** This is the most common mistake that people make when trying to solve this problem. The merge sort algorithm is a recursive algorithm, so it's important to make sure that you're calling the merge sort function correctly.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of merge sort calls.** When you're merging two sorted arrays, you need to make sure that you're only counting the number of merge sort calls that are actually necessary. For example, if you're merging two arrays that are already sorted, you shouldn't count that as a merge sort call.
3. **Incorrect input or output formatting.** Make sure that you're reading the input and writing the output in the correct format. The input should be two integers, n and k, and the output should be a permutation of size n such that there will be exactly k calls of mergesort while sorting it.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** Make sure that you're not making any off-by-one errors when you're calculating the indices of the elements in the array.
5. **Memory leaks.** Make sure that you're releasing any memory that you allocate during your program. This is especially important if you're using a language like C or C++, which doesn't have garbage collection.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. **Use a good reference implementation of the merge sort algorithm.** There are many good reference implementations of the merge sort algorithm available online. If you're not sure how to implement the merge sort algorithm, I recommend starting with one of these implementations.
2. **Test your code thoroughly.** Once you've implemented the merge sort algorithm, you should test your code thoroughly. This will help you to catch any bugs that you might have missed.
3. **Use a debugger.** If you're having trouble debugging your code, I recommend using a debugger. A debugger can help you to track down the source of any bugs that you might have.
4. **Ask for help.** If you're still having trouble solving the problem, I recommend asking for help. There are many online forums and communities where you can get help with programming problems.

Title:
CODEFORCES 976_B. Lara Croft and the New Game

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format is not strictly defined. For example, the input could contain spaces between the numbers, or the numbers could be separated by commas. This could cause the program to read the input incorrectly and produce incorrect results.

### 2. Incorrect calculation of Lara's position

The program must calculate Lara's position by taking into account the number of times she has moved, the size of the dungeon, and the path that she is following. If the program does not correctly calculate Lara's position, it will produce incorrect results.

### 3. Off-by-one errors

When calculating Lara's position, it is important to make sure that the indices of the rows and columns are correct. A common mistake is to use the wrong index, which can result in Lara being placed in the wrong cell.

### 4. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

If the program tries to access an element of an array that does not exist, it will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. This exception can be avoided by making sure that the indices of the arrays are valid.

### 5. Arithmetic overflow

The number of times that Lara can move is represented by a 64-bit integer. If the number of moves is greater than 2^63-1, the program will experience an arithmetic overflow. This can be avoided by using a larger integer type to represent the number of moves.
Test inputs:

Title:
CODEFORCES 995_F. Cowmpany Cowmpensation

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type:** The input data is given as two integers, `n` and `D`. However, the output should be a single integer. If you accidentally use a `long` or `double` type for the output, you will get a compilation error.
2. **Off-by-one errors:** The problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ n ≤ 3000` and `1 ≤ D ≤ 10^9`. However, if you accidentally use a `size_t` or `int` type for `n` or `D`, you may get an overflow error.
3. **Incorrect modulo arithmetic:** The problem statement specifies that the output should be modulo `10^9 + 7`. However, if you accidentally use the wrong modulo operator, you may get an incorrect answer.
4. **Off-by-one errors in array indexing:** The problem statement specifies that the employees are numbered from 1 to `n`. However, if you accidentally index into an array with an index that is too large or too small, you will get an out-of-bounds error.
5. **Incorrect use of pointers:** The problem statement does not mention anything about pointers. However, if you accidentally use pointers in your solution, you may get a compilation error or a runtime error.
6. **Incorrect use of dynamic memory allocation:** The problem statement does not mention anything about dynamic memory allocation. However, if you accidentally allocate dynamic memory, you may get a memory leak or a segmentation fault.
7. **Incorrect use of the `std::vector` class:** The problem statement does not mention anything about the `std::vector` class. However, if you accidentally use the `std::vector` class in your solution, you may get a compilation error or a runtime error.
8. **Incorrect use of the `std::map` class:** The problem statement does not mention anything about the `std::map` class. However, if you accidentally use the `std::map` class in your solution, you may get a compilation error or a runtime error.
9. **Incorrect use of the `std::set` class:** The problem statement does not mention anything about the `std::set` class. However, if you accidentally use the `std::set` class in your solution, you may get a compilation error or a runtime error.
10. **Incorrect use of the `std::sort` function:** The problem statement does not mention anything about the `std::sort` function. However, if you accidentally use the `std::sort` function in your solution, you may get a compilation error or a runtime error.

Title:
HACKEREARTH circle-intersection

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect calculation of distance between the centers of the circles.** The distance between the centers of the circles is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. However, the developer may accidentally use the wrong values for the lengths of the sides of the triangle. This would result in an incorrect calculation of the distance between the centers of the circles, which could lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the radius of the intersection of the circles.** The radius of the intersection of the circles is calculated using the distance between the centers of the circles and the sum of the radii of the circles. However, the developer may accidentally use the wrong values for any of these three values. This would result in an incorrect calculation of the radius of the intersection of the circles, which could lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect determination of whether the circles overlap.** The circles overlap if the distance between their centers is less than or equal to the sum of their radii. However, the developer may accidentally compare the distance between the centers of the circles to the difference of their radii. This would result in an incorrect determination of whether the circles overlap, which could lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect output of the results.** The developer may accidentally output the wrong answer to the problem. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a typo or a misunderstanding of the problem.
5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:
    * Using the wrong data types for the input values.
    * Using the wrong formulas to calculate the distance between the centers of the circles, the radius of the intersection of the circles, or whether the circles overlap.
    * Misunderstanding the problem and providing incorrect results.
    * Making other programming errors.

HACKEREARTH emma-and-the-prime-sum

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the `is_prime()` function.** The `is_prime()` function checks whether a number is prime. However, if the number is negative, the function will return `False`. This is because the `is_prime()` function only checks for positive integers.
2. **Using the `range()` function incorrectly.** The `range()` function returns a sequence of numbers from a starting point to an ending point. However, if the ending point is less than the starting point, the `range()` function will return an empty sequence.
3. **Using the `sum()` function incorrectly.** The `sum()` function adds all the elements in a sequence. However, if the sequence is empty, the `sum()` function will return `0`.
4. **Using the `for` loop incorrectly.** The `for` loop iterates over a sequence of elements. However, if the sequence is empty, the `for` loop will not iterate over any elements.
5. **Using the `if` statement incorrectly.** The `if` statement checks whether a condition is true. However, if the condition is not true, the `if` statement will not execute the code block.

Here are some tips to avoid these problems:

1. **Always check the documentation for the `is_prime()` function before using it.** The documentation will tell you what the function does and how to use it correctly.
2. **Make sure you use the `range()` function correctly.** The `range()` function has a few different parameters that you can use to specify the starting point, the ending point, and the step size.
3. **Use the `sum()` function correctly.** The `sum()` function can only add elements from a sequence. If you try to add elements from a non-sequence, the `sum()` function will throw an error.
4. **Use the `for` loop correctly.** The `for` loop iterates over a sequence of elements. If the sequence is empty, the `for` loop will not iterate over any elements.
5. **Use the `if` statement correctly.** The `if` statement checks whether a condition is true. If the condition is not true, the `if` statement will not execute the code block.

HACKEREARTH hello-brother

Pain points:
**1. The input may not be in the correct format.** For example, the input may contain two numbers instead of three, or the numbers may not be separated by a space.
2. The input may contain invalid values. For example, the numbers may be negative or greater than 1000.
3. The output may not be in the correct format. For example, the output may not be a single digit number.
4. The program may not be able to handle large inputs. For example, the program may run out of memory if the input contains a large number of numbers.
5. The program may not be able to handle inputs that are not in order. For example, the program may not be able to find the number x if it is not in the first n numbers.
6. The program may not be able to handle inputs that contain duplicate numbers. For example, the program may incorrectly identify the number x if it is repeated in the first n numbers.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input and output formats, and make sure that the program can handle all possible cases. The developer should also test the program with a variety of inputs to make sure that it works correctly.

HACKEREARTH lucky-sequence

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one error.** The input is 1-indexed, but the output is 0-indexed. Make sure to subtract 1 from the input when computing the index of the lucky string in the list.
2. **Incorrect sorting.** The lucky strings are sorted by length first, then lexicographically. Make sure to order the strings correctly in your code.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the lucky string generation algorithm.** The lucky strings are generated by iteratively appending 4s and 7s to the end of the string. Make sure to correctly implement this algorithm in your code.
4. **Memory errors.** The lucky strings can grow very long, so it is important to use a memory-efficient data structure to store them.
5. **Time complexity.** The time complexity of the solution should be O(log n), where n is the number of lucky strings. Make sure that your code runs in time for large inputs.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. Use a debugger to step through your code and check for off-by-one errors.
2. Use a test suite to verify that your code is correctly sorting the lucky strings.
3. Carefully review the implementation of the lucky string generation algorithm.
4. Use a memory-efficient data structure to store the lucky strings.
5. Use a divide-and-conquer algorithm to reduce the time complexity of the solution.

Title:
HACKEREARTH xenny-and-counting

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input contains two integers, N and k. N and k should be of type int. If they are not of type int, the program will not work correctly.

**2. Using incorrect operators**

The problem statement says that Xynazog could get [0,k] points in each move. This means that Xynazog could get any integer from 0 to k in each move. However, if you use the incorrect operators, the program will not work correctly. For example, if you use the operator < instead of <=, the program will not work correctly.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The problem statement says that Xynazog could play at most N moves. This means that Xynazog could not play more than N moves. However, if you use incorrect logic, the program will not work correctly. For example, if you say that Xynazog could play N + 1 moves, the program will not work correctly.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement does not specify what to do if N or k is equal to 0. This means that you need to handle these edge cases. For example, if N is equal to 0, Xynazog cannot score any points. Similarly, if k is equal to 0, Xynazog cannot score any points.

**5. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a simple recursive algorithm. However, there is a more efficient algorithm that can be used. This algorithm uses dynamic programming to find the number of ways in which Xynazog can score k points in exactly N moves.

Title:
ATCODER p02646 Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Programming Contest 2020 - Tag

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The problem states that `A`, `B`, `V`, `W`, and `T` are integers. However, if you accidentally declare them as floats, you may get incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator**. The problem states that "He can catch her when his coordinate is the same as hers". This means that `A == B`. However, if you accidentally use the `>` or `<` operator, you may get incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The problem states that "He can catch her within T seconds (including exactly T seconds later)". This means that `A + V * T >= B` and `B + W * T >= A`. However, if you accidentally calculate these inequalities incorrectly, you may get incorrect results.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The problem states that "He can catch her within T seconds (including exactly T seconds later)". This means that `A + V * (T - 1) >= B` and `B + W * (T - 1) >= A`. However, if you accidentally calculate these inequalities with `T` instead of `T - 1`, you may get incorrect results.
5. **Infinite loop**. The problem states that "He can catch her when his coordinate is the same as hers". This means that `A == B`. However, if you accidentally enter two equal values for `A` and `B`, the program will enter an infinite loop.
6. **Arithmetic overflow**. The problem states that `A`, `B`, `V`, `W`, and `T` are integers. However, if you accidentally enter a value that is too large for an integer, the program may overflow and produce incorrect results.

Title:
ATCODER p02775 AtCoder Beginner Contest 155 - Payment

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type to store N.**

The input N can be as large as 10^1,000,000, so it is important to use a data type that can store numbers of this size. In Python, this would be the `int` type.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm to find the minimum number of banknotes.**

The naive algorithm for finding the minimum number of banknotes would be to try every possible combination of banknotes and choose the one that uses the fewest notes. However, this algorithm would be very inefficient, as it would have to iterate through a very large number of combinations.

A more efficient algorithm would be to use dynamic programming. This algorithm works by building up a table of the minimum number of banknotes needed to make a given change. Once the table is built, it can be used to find the minimum number of banknotes needed to make any change, including N.

**3. Using incorrect rounding when calculating the change.**

When calculating the change, it is important to round the amount of money you give to the clerk to the nearest multiple of the smallest banknote. For example, if the smallest banknote is worth 10, and you give the clerk 100, you would round this to 100. However, if you give the clerk 101, you would round this to 110.

**4. Not handling the case where N is negative.**

The problem statement states that N must be an integer between 1 and 10^1,000,000. However, it is possible for a user to input a negative value for N. If this happens, the program should handle the error gracefully and print an appropriate message.

**5. Not handling the case where N is equal to 0.**

The problem statement does not explicitly state what should happen if N is equal to 0. However, it is reasonable to assume that the minimum number of banknotes needed to make a change of 0 is 0. If this is not the case, the program should handle the error gracefully and print an appropriate message.

Title:
ATCODER p03045 AtCoder Beginner Contest 126 - 1 or 2

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input format specifies that N and M are integers. However, if you accidentally use a floating-point type for these values, you may get unexpected results. For example, if you use float for N and M, you may get an incorrect answer for the following input:

```
N = 1000000000
M = 1000000000
```

The correct answer is 1000000000, but if you use float, you may get an answer like 1000000001. This is because floating-point numbers are not exact representations of real numbers. They are only approximations, and the approximation can become worse as the number gets larger.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks you to find the minimum cost required to determine all of A_1, A_2, ..., A_N. There are many different algorithms that you could use to solve this problem. However, not all algorithms are guaranteed to find the optimal solution. For example, the following algorithm is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution:

```
# Initialize the cost to infinity.
cost = float('inf')

# Iterate over all possible combinations of A_1, A_2, ..., A_N.
for i in range(1, N + 1):
  for j in range(i + 1, N + 1):
    # Calculate the cost of this combination.
    cost = min(cost, 1 + abs(A_i - A_j))

# Return the minimum cost.
return cost
```

This algorithm works by iterating over all possible combinations of A_1, A_2, ..., A_N. For each combination, it calculates the cost of that combination. The algorithm then returns the minimum cost that it found. However, this algorithm is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution. For example, if the optimal solution is to know the value of A_1, this algorithm may not find it.

**3. Not handling corner cases**

The problem statement specifies several corner cases. For example, it specifies that N and M must be integers. It also specifies that the pairs (X_i, Y_i) must be distinct. If you do not handle these corner cases correctly, you may get an incorrect answer.

**4. Using inefficient data structures**

The problem requires you to store the values of A_1, A_2, ..., A_N. If you use an inefficient data structure, such as a linked list, you may get an incorrect answer. For example, if you use a linked list to store the values of A_1, A_2, ..., A_N, you may not be able to access the values in O(1) time. This could lead to an incorrect answer if you need to access the values in O(1) time.

**5. Not using memoization**

The problem can be solved recursively. However, if you do not use memoization, you may get an incorrect answer. For example, if you try to solve the problem recursively without memoization, you may end up recalculating the same subproblems multiple times. This could lead to an incorrect answer.

**6. Not using dynamic programming**

The problem can be solved using dynamic programming. Dynamic programming is a technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems. The solutions to the subproblems can then be used to solve the original problem. If you do not use dynamic programming, you may get an incorrect answer.

**7. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed. You can test your code by using a test harness or by manually testing it.
Test inputs:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

# Iterate over all possible combinations of A_1, A_2, ..., A_N.
for i in range(1, N + 1):
  for j in range(i + 1, N + 1):
    # Calculate the cost of this combination.
    cost = min(cost, 1 + abs(A_i - A_j))

# Return the minimum cost.
return cost
```

**3. Not handling corner cases**

```
N = 0
M = 1
```

**4. Using inefficient data structures**

```
A = []
for i in range(N):
  A.append(int(input()))
```

**5. Not using memoization**

```
def solve(i, j, z):
  if i == j:
    return 1
  if z == 0:
    return solve(i + 1, j - 1, 1) + 1

N = int(input())
M = int(input())
for i in range(M):
  x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
  print(solve(x, y, z))
```

**6. Not using dynamic programming**

```
def solve(N, M):
  dp = [[float('inf') for _ in range(N + 1)] for _ in range(N + 1)]
  for i in range(N + 1):
    dp[i][i] = 1
  for z in range(1, M + 1):
    for i in range(N + 1):
      for j in range(i + 1, N + 1):
        if z == 0:
          dp[i][j] = min(dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 1, dp[i][j - 1])
        else:
          dp[i][j] = min(dp[i + 1][j - 1], dp[i][j - 1])
  return dp[1][N]

N = int(input())
M = int(input())

ATCODER p03187 AtCoder Grand Contest 030 - Tree Burning

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not clear**. It is not clear whether the input should be a list of numbers or a list of tuples.
2. The output format is not clear. It is not clear whether the output should be a single number or a list of numbers.
3. The problem statement is not clear. It is not clear what Takahashi's residence is or what it means to "burn" a tree.
4. The algorithm is not clear. It is not clear how Takahashi's walking distance is calculated or how the algorithm terminates.
5. The code is not clear. It is not clear what the code is doing or how it works.

Here are some possible solutions to these problems:

1. The input format can be made clearer by using a list of tuples. For example, the input for the first example could be written as follows:
```
L = 10
N = 3
trees = [(2,), (7,), (9,)]
```

2. The output format can be made clearer by using a single number. For example, the output for the first example could be written as follows:
```
15
```

3. The problem statement can be made clearer by providing more details. For example, Takahashi's residence is the point on the circumference of the lake with coordinate 0. To "burn" a tree, Takahashi must walk to the tree and then stay at that position. The algorithm terminates when all trees have been burnt.

4. The algorithm can be made clearer by providing more details. For example, Takahashi's walking distance is calculated by adding up the distances between each tree and the previous tree. The algorithm terminates when all trees have been burnt.

5. The code can be made clearer by using comments to explain what each line of code is doing. For example, the following code could be used to solve the first example:
```
L = int(input())
N = int(input())
trees = [(int(x) for x in input().split()) for _ in range(N)]
trees.sort()

distance = 0
for tree in trees:
    distance += tree[0]

print(distance)

Title:
ATCODER p03334 AtCoder Grand Contest 025 - Choosing Points

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not correct. For example, if the input is `2 1 2 a`, the program will crash because it cannot parse the third input `a`.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not correct. For example, if the output is `0 0 0 2 2 0 2 2`, the program will crash because it cannot parse the fourth input `2 0`.

**3. Incorrect distance calculation**

The distance between two points is not calculated correctly. For example, if the two points are `(0, 0)` and `(1, 1)`, the distance between them is not `√2`.

**4. Incorrect choice of points**

The points that are chosen do not form a good set. For example, if the points are `(0, 0)`, `(1, 1)`, and `(2, 2)`, the distance between any two points is `√2`, which is not allowed.

**5. Incorrect number of points**

The number of points that are chosen is not `N^2`. For example, if `N = 3`, the number of points that are chosen should be `9`, but the program only chooses `8` points.

Title:
ATCODER p03494 AtCoder Beginner Contest 081 - Shift only

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a list of integers. If we use the wrong data type to store the input data, we may get incorrect results. For example, if we use a `string` to store the input data, we may get incorrect results when the input data contains a number that is too large to be represented by a `string`.

**2. Not handling edge cases**

The input data may contain edge cases. For example, the input data may be empty, or it may contain a number that is equal to 1. We need to handle these edge cases correctly.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The problem asks us to find the maximum possible number of operations that Snuke can perform. We need to use the correct logic to find the maximum possible number of operations. For example, we need to consider the possibility that Snuke can perform multiple operations in a row.

**4. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a simple algorithm. However, we can use a more efficient algorithm to solve the problem. For example, we can use a binary search to find the maximum possible number of operations.

Title:
AIZU p01117 Scores of Final Examination

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The input data is a list of lists. If we try to iterate over it with a for loop, we will get a `TypeError`.
2. **Off-by-one error.** When we calculate the total score of a student, we need to add the scores of all subjects. However, we may forget to add the last score.
3. **Index out of range error.** When we iterate over the list of lists, we may try to access an element that doesn't exist.
4. **Arithmetic error.** When we add the scores of all subjects, we may get an overflow error.
5. **Memory leak.** If we don't release the memory that we allocated for the lists, we may eventually run out of memory.
6. **Race condition.** If multiple threads are trying to access the same data at the same time, we may get inconsistent results.
7. **Security vulnerability.** If we don't properly sanitize the input data, we may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on our system.

Title:
AIZU p01570 Usoperanto

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is specified as follows:

```
> N
> M0 L0
> ...
> MN-1 LN-1
>
```

where `N` is the number of words in the phrase, and `M0`, `L0`, ..., `MN-1`, `LN-1` are the lengths and modification indices of the words, respectively.

However, the input may not be in the correct format. For example, the input `3` may not be followed by `M0 L0`, or the input `3 3 -1` may not be followed by `4 0`. If the input is not in the correct format, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect data**

The data in the input may be incorrect. For example, the length of a word may be negative, or the modification index of a word may be out of range. If the data is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The program may contain incorrect logic. For example, the program may not correctly calculate the total modification cost. If the logic is incorrect, the program may produce incorrect output.

**4. Incorrect implementation**

The program may be incorrectly implemented. For example, the program may not use the correct data structures or algorithms. If the implementation is incorrect, the program may run slowly or produce incorrect output.

**5. Incorrect testing**

The program may not be tested correctly. For example, the program may not be tested with all possible inputs or with inputs that are likely to cause errors. If the testing is incorrect, the program may not be able to find all bugs.

Title:
AIZU p02007 Prefix Suffix Search

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type.** The input data is not always in the correct format. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or a string that contains non-lowercase English letters. The developer should check the input data type and raise an error if the data is not in the correct format.
2. **Incorrect length.** The input data may not be of the correct length. For example, the number of words in the list may not be equal to the number of queries. The developer should check the length of the input data and raise an error if the data is not of the correct length.
3. **Duplicate data.** The input data may contain duplicate values. For example, the list of words may contain two words that are the same. The developer should check for duplicate data and remove any duplicates before processing the data.
4. **Malformed data.** The input data may be malformed. For example, the list of words may contain a word that is not a valid English word. The developer should check for malformed data and raise an error if the data is malformed.
5. **Off-by-one errors.** The developer may make off-by-one errors when counting the number of words that match a given prefix and suffix. For example, the developer may count the word "appreciate" as matching the prefix "appr" and the suffix "iate", even though the word does not actually end with the suffix "iate". The developer should carefully check their code to avoid off-by-one errors.

Title:
AIZU p02151 Phone Number

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is "$ N$
$S$", where $N$ is the length of the phone number and $S$ is the phone number itself. However, if the input format is incorrect, such as "$N$ $S$", the program will not be able to process the input correctly and will likely crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is a 3x3 grid of numbers, with no spaces between the numbers. However, if the output format is incorrect, such as "123 456 789", the program will not be able to output the correct answer and will likely crash.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the number of movements**

The number of movements of the index finger is calculated by counting the number of times the finger moves from one button to another. However, if the calculation is incorrect, such as counting the number of times the finger moves from a button to itself, the program will not be able to calculate the correct answer and will likely crash.

**4. Incorrect arrangement of the buttons**

The buttons on the phone are arranged in a 3x3 grid, with each button corresponding to a number from 1 to 9. However, if the buttons are arranged incorrectly, such as "123 456 789", the program will not be able to output the correct answer and will likely crash.

**5. Incorrect dictionary order**

The numbers in the output are arranged in dictionary order, with the smallest number first. However, if the numbers are not arranged in dictionary order, such as "123 456 789", the program will not be able to output the correct answer and will likely crash.
Test inputs:

Title:
AIZU p02292 Counter-Clockwise

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect calculation of cross product.** The cross product of two vectors is a vector perpendicular to both vectors. It can be calculated as follows:

```
cross_product(v1, v2) = (v1[1] * v2[2] - v1[2] * v2[1], v1[2] * v2[0] - v1[0] * v2[2], v1[0] * v2[1] - v1[1] * v2[0])
```

If the cross product of two vectors is positive, then the vectors are oriented in a counterclockwise direction. If the cross product is negative, then the vectors are oriented in a clockwise direction. If the cross product is zero, then the vectors are parallel or antiparallel.

2. **Incorrect comparison of cross products.** When comparing the cross products of two vectors, it is important to make sure that the vectors are in the same order. For example, the cross product of `(1, 0, 0)` and `(0, 1, 0)` is `(0, 0, 1)`, but the cross product of `(0, 1, 0)` and `(1, 0, 0)` is `(0, 0, -1)`.

3. **Incorrect use of the orientation test.** The orientation test can be used to determine whether a point is on the same side of a line as another point. To do this, you need to calculate the cross product of the vector from the first point to the second point and the vector from the first point to the third point. If the cross product is positive, then the points are on the same side of the line. If the cross product is negative, then the points are on opposite sides of the line. If the cross product is zero, then the points are collinear.

4. **Incorrect use of the segment intersection test.** The segment intersection test can be used to determine whether two segments intersect. To do this, you need to calculate the intersection of the two lines that contain the segments. If the intersection is a point, then the segments intersect. If the intersection is a line, then the segments are parallel. If the intersection is empty, then the segments do not intersect.

5. **Incorrect handling of degenerate cases.** There are a few degenerate cases that need to be handled carefully when solving this problem. For example, if two of the points are collinear, then the cross product of the vectors from the first point to the other two points will be zero. If two of the points are the same, then the segment intersection test will return an empty intersection.

6. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.** Floating-point numbers are subject to rounding errors, which can lead to incorrect results. It is important to use the correct precision when performing calculations with floating-point numbers.

Title:
AIZU p02439 Min-Max

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input is given as three integers, but the developer may mistakenly read it as strings. This would cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect comparison operators**. The program should compare the three integers and output the minimum and maximum values. The developer may mistakenly use the wrong comparison operators, such as `>` instead of `<`. This would cause the program to output incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. The program should print the minimum and maximum values, separated by a space. The developer may mistakenly print the values in the wrong order, or forget to add the space between them. This would cause the output to be incorrect.
4. **Other logic errors**. The program may contain other logic errors, such as using the wrong variables or forgetting to initialize variables. These errors could cause the program to crash or output incorrect results.
