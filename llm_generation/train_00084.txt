1. **Off-by-one errors.** When computing the distance between two cells, it is important to make sure that you are subtracting the row and column numbers correctly. For example, if cell A is at (1, 1) and cell B is at (2, 2), the distance between them is not 3, it is 4.
2. **Incorrect assumptions about the input data.** The input data for this problem is a grid of characters. It is important to make sure that you are interpreting the data correctly. For example, if the grid contains the character `0`, you should interpret that as a land cell, not a water cell.
3. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The input data for this problem is a grid of characters. It is important to choose the right data structure to store this data. For example, you could use a two-dimensional array, or you could use a linked list.
4. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** The problem asks you to find the minimum possible cost of creating a tunnel between two cells. There are many different algorithms that you could use to solve this problem. You need to choose the right algorithm for the problem at hand.
5. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** Once you have chosen an algorithm to solve the problem, you need to implement it correctly. This is where most of the bugs in your code will likely occur. Make sure that you test your code thoroughly before submitting it.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Off-by-one error:** A developer might incorrectly subtract the row and column numbers when computing the distance between two cells. This would result in an incorrect answer.
* **Incorrect assumption about the input data:** A developer might incorrectly assume that all of the cells in the grid are land cells. This would result in an incorrect answer.
* **Incorrect use of data structures:** A developer might use the wrong data structure to store the input data. This could lead to slow performance or incorrect results.
* **Incorrect use of algorithms:** A developer might use the wrong algorithm to solve the problem. This could lead to slow performance or incorrect results.
* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm:** A developer might implement the algorithm incorrectly. This could lead to slow performance or incorrect results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1150_D. Three Religions

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of data types**

One common mistake that developers make when solving this problem is to use the wrong data type to store the input. For example, if the input is a string of length 100,000, it is important to store it in a variable of type `string` or `char[]` rather than `int` or `char`. This is because `int` and `char` can only store values up to a certain size, and trying to store a string of length 100,000 in either of these data types will result in an overflow error.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

Another common mistake that developers make when solving this problem is to make an off-by-one error. For example, if the developer is trying to find the index of a character in a string, they may accidentally start counting from the wrong index. This can result in the developer finding the wrong index, which can lead to incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect use of pointers**

If the developer is using pointers to access the input, it is important to make sure that the pointers are pointing to valid memory locations. If the pointers are not pointing to valid memory locations, the developer may encounter a segmentation fault.

**4. Using uninitialized variables**

It is important to initialize all variables before using them. If a variable is not initialized, it may contain garbage data, which can lead to incorrect results.

**5. Not handling errors correctly**

It is important to handle errors correctly. For example, if the developer is trying to open a file, they should check for errors and handle them appropriately. If the developer does not handle errors correctly, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

**6. Using too much memory**

It is important to be aware of the amount of memory that your program is using. If your program uses too much memory, it may crash or slow down your computer.

**7. Not using the right algorithm**

The best way to solve this problem is to use the right algorithm. There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem, and the best algorithm for your particular application will depend on the specific constraints of your problem.

**8. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before deploying it to production. This will help you to catch any bugs before they cause problems for your users.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1228_D. Complete Tripartite

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect graph representation**

The first step in solving this problem is to correctly represent the graph. The input graph is given as a list of edges, where each edge is represented by two integers, the endpoints of the edge. However, this representation is not always correct. For example, the following graph is not correctly represented:

```
0 -> 1
1 -> 2
2 -> 0
```

This graph has two edges, but it only has one vertex. To correctly represent this graph, we need to add a new vertex and connect it to the other two vertices:

```
0 -> 1
0 -> 2
1 -> 0
2 -> 0
```

**2. Incorrect use of sets**

The second step in solving this problem is to use sets to represent the three vertex sets. However, it is important to use the correct type of set. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
sets = []
for i in range(3):
  sets.append(set())
```

This code will create three empty lists, not three sets. To create three sets, we need to use the `set()` function:

```
sets = []
for i in range(3):
  sets.append(set())
```

**3. Incorrect use of the `in` operator**

The third step in solving this problem is to use the `in` operator to check if a vertex is in a set. However, it is important to use the correct syntax. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
if v in sets[i]:
  print("YES")
else:
  print("NO")
```

This code will check if the value `v` is in the list `sets[i]`. To check if the vertex `v` is in the set `sets[i]`, we need to use the following syntax:

```
if v in sets[i]:
  print("YES")
else:
  print("NO")
```

**4. Incorrect use of the `len()` function**

The fourth step in solving this problem is to use the `len()` function to get the number of elements in a set. However, it is important to use the correct syntax. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
if len(sets[i]) == 3:
  print("YES")
else:
  print("NO")
```

This code will check if the length of the list `sets[i]` is equal to 3. To check if the length of the set `sets[i]` is equal to 3, we need to use the following syntax:

```
if len(sets[i]) == 3:
  print("YES")
else:
  print("NO")
```

**5. Incorrect use of the `for` loop**

The fifth step in solving this problem is to use a `for` loop to iterate over the edges in the graph. However, it is important to use the correct syntax. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
for edge in edges:
  a = edge[0]
  b = edge[1]
```

This code will iterate over the elements in the list `edges`. To iterate over the edges in the graph, we need to use the following syntax:

```
for edge in edges:
  a = edge[0]
  b = edge[1]
```

CODEFORCES 1313_B. Different Rules

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The input variables `n`, `x`, and `y` are all integers, but the code below incorrectly defines them as strings. This will cause errors when the code tries to perform mathematical operations on them.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator.** The code below uses the `==` operator to compare the variables `x` and `y`, but this is incorrect. The `==` operator only checks if two variables are equal, but in this case we need to check if one variable is less than or equal to the other. The correct operator to use is `<=`.
3. **Missing curly braces.** The code below is missing curly braces around the condition in the `if` statement. This will cause the code to always execute the `else` statement, even if the condition is true.
4. **Incorrect indentation.** The code below is not properly indented, which can make it difficult to read and understand.
5. **Unnecessary variable.** The code below defines a variable `i` that is never used. This can cause confusion and make the code more difficult to maintain.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())

    min_place = max(x, y) + 1
    max_place = n - min(x, y) + 1

CODEFORCES 1358_B. Maria Breaks the Self-isolation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is not very strict, but it is still important to follow it. For example, if you forget to add a space between two integers, the code will not work correctly.
2. **Incorrect variable type**. The problem statement specifies that the input numbers should be integers. However, if you accidentally type a float number, the code will not work correctly.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The most common mistake when solving this problem is to forget to take into account the fact that grannies can come into the courtyard at the same time. For example, if you only consider the grannies who come into the courtyard one by one, you will get the wrong answer.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of mistake that can occur when you are counting or comparing numbers. For example, if you forget to add 1 to the number of grannies in the courtyard, you will get the wrong answer.
5. **Memory errors**. If your code is too complex, it may run out of memory and crash. To avoid this, make sure that your code is efficient and uses only the necessary resources.
6. **Time errors**. If your code takes too long to run, it may not be able to finish before the time limit is reached. To avoid this, make sure that your code is efficient and uses only the necessary resources.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

* Carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand all of the requirements.
* Use the correct variable types for the input and output data.

CODEFORCES 1399_C. Boats Competition

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data contains integers, so we need to use the `int` data type to store them. If we use a different data type, such as `float`, the program may produce incorrect results.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The problem can be solved using the greedy algorithm. The greedy algorithm works by making a locally optimal choice at each step. In this problem, the locally optimal choice is to pair the heaviest person with the lightest person. However, if we use a different algorithm, such as the brute force algorithm, the program may take a long time to run and may not produce the correct answer.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement specifies that each participant can be in no more than one team. If we do not handle this edge case, the program may produce incorrect results.

**4. Using incorrect variable names**

The problem statement uses the following variable names: `t`, `n`, `w`, `s`, `k`. If we use different variable names, the program may not compile or may produce incorrect results.

**5. Forgetting to check for errors**

The program should check for errors, such as invalid input data or division by zero. If we do not check for errors, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.
Test inputs:
```
# Test case 1

t = 1
n = 5
w = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Title:
CODEFORCES 1491_I. Ruler Of The Zoo

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the tournament rules**

The most important part of the problem is to correctly implement the tournament rules. A common mistake is to incorrectly implement the rules for when an animal wins a fight. For example, the rules state that an animal who wins 3 times consecutively will be crowned ruler for the whole zoo. However, a common mistake is to only check if the current animal has won 3 consecutive fights, and not to check if any other animal has also won 3 consecutive fights. This can lead to an incorrect answer.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the data structures**

Another common mistake is to incorrectly implement the data structures used to store the animals and their strengths. For example, a common mistake is to use a list to store the animals, but then to try to access the animals by their index. This can lead to an incorrect answer.

**3. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The final common mistake is to incorrectly implement the algorithm used to solve the problem. For example, a common mistake is to try to solve the problem by brute force. This can lead to an incorrect answer or a very slow solution.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement. It is also important to carefully implement the tournament rules, the data structures, and the algorithm. By following these steps, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs that developers may encounter when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 169_E. Conveyor

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format for this problem is not very clear. It is not clear whether the input should be a list of integers or a string of integers separated by spaces. This can lead to errors if the input is not formatted correctly.

For example, the following input is not valid:

```
1 2 3 4
```

This should be formatted as follows:

```
1, 2, 3, 4
```

### 2. Incorrect output format

The output format for this problem is also not very clear. It is not clear whether the output should be a list of floats or a string of floats separated by spaces. This can lead to errors if the output is not formatted correctly.

For example, the following output is not valid:

```
[0.5, 0.5]
```

This should be formatted as follows:

```
0.5 0.5
```

### 3. Incorrect calculation of probabilities

The probability of picking up a chocolate is calculated by dividing the number of chocolates that Anton can pick up by the total number of chocolates. However, it is important to note that the number of chocolates that Anton can pick up is not the same as the number of chocolates that are actually on the belt. This is because Anton can only pick up chocolates that are in front of him.

For example, if Anton is running at a speed of 2 meters per second and the belt is moving at a speed of 1 meter per second, then Anton can only pick up chocolates that are within 1 meter of him. If there are 5 chocolates on the belt, but only 3 of them are within 1 meter of Anton, then the probability of Anton picking up a chocolate is 3 / 5.

### 4. Floating point errors

When calculating probabilities, it is important to be aware of floating point errors. Floating point numbers are not exact representations of real numbers, and this can lead to errors in calculations.

For example, the following calculation is not accurate:

```
0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3
```

This is because the floating point representation of 0.1 is not exactly equal to the floating point representation of 0.2. The actual value of 0.1 + 0.2 is slightly less than 0.3.

To avoid floating point errors, it is important to use the `round()` function to round floating point numbers to the desired precision.

### 5. Undefined behavior

The code for this problem contains some undefined behavior. Undefined behavior is behavior that is not specified by the C++ standard and can vary from compiler to compiler.

For example, the following code is undefined behavior:

```
int x = 1;
int y = x / 0;
```

The compiler is free to do whatever it wants with this code. It could crash, it could return an arbitrary value, or it could even generate a different value each time it is executed.

It is important to avoid undefined behavior in your code, as it can lead to unexpected results.

### 6. Memory leaks

The code for this problem also contains some memory leaks. A memory leak is when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to a gradual increase in the amount of memory that is used by the program, which can eventually cause the program to crash.

To avoid memory leaks, it is important to free all memory that is allocated when it is no longer needed.

### 7. Security vulnerabilities

The code for this problem also contains some security vulnerabilities. A security vulnerability is a weakness in a program that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.

For example, the following code is a security vulnerability:

```
char *password = getenv("password");
```

This code gets the value of the `password` environment variable and stores it in a local variable. This is a security vulnerability because the `password` environment variable could contain a password that an attacker could use to gain unauthorized access to the system.

To avoid security vulnerabilities, it is important to follow secure coding practices.

CODEFORCES 18_C. Stripe

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain a string instead of an integer, or the number of squares may be negative. The developer should check the input format and raise an error if it is incorrect.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correctly followed. For example, the output may contain a float instead of an integer, or the number of ways to cut the stripe may be negative. The developer should check the output format and raise an error if it is incorrect.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of ways to cut the stripe**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the number of ways to cut the stripe. For example, the developer may not take into account the fact that the stripe can be cut along the squares' borders only. The developer should carefully check the calculation of the number of ways to cut the stripe and make sure that it is correct.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. The developer may not correctly handle edge cases. For example, the developer may not handle the case when the number of squares in the stripe is 0 or 1. The developer should carefully check the code and make sure that it handles all edge cases correctly.
5. **Other bugs**. There may be other bugs in the code that are not mentioned here. The developer should carefully check the code and make sure that it is free of bugs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 213_C. Relay Race

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is specified as follows:

```
The first line contains a single integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 300). The next n lines contain n integers each: the j-th number on the i-th line ai, j ( - 1000 ≤ ai, j ≤ 1000) is the number written in the cell with coordinates (i, j).
```

If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will likely crash.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format for this problem is specified as follows:

```
On a single line print a single number — the answer to the problem.
```

If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will likely receive a incorrect answer.

3. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating over the array of cells, it is easy to make a mistake and iterate over one cell too many or one cell too few. This can result in the program missing a cell or counting a cell twice, which will lead to an incorrect answer.

4. **Indexing errors**. When accessing the elements of the array of cells, it is easy to make a mistake and index the array incorrectly. This can result in the program accessing invalid memory or accessing the same cell multiple times, which will lead to an incorrect answer.

5. **Data race**. If two threads are accessing the same cell of the array of cells at the same time, it is possible for them to corrupt the data. This can lead to the program producing an incorrect answer or crashing.

6. **Synchronization errors**. If two threads are waiting for each other to finish accessing a cell of the array of cells, it is possible for them to deadlock. This can lead to the program being unable to progress and eventually crashing.

7. **Memory leak**. If the program does not properly free the memory that it allocates, it will eventually run out of memory and crash.

8. **Stack overflow**. If the program recursively calls itself too many times, it will eventually exhaust the stack and crash.

CODEFORCES 311_A. The Closest Pair

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect sorting order.** The code sorts the points by their x-coordinates first, and then by their y-coordinates. However, the correct order is to sort them by their y-coordinates first, and then by their x-coordinates. This is because the distance between two points is only affected by their y-coordinates, not their x-coordinates.
2. **Inefficient algorithm.** The code uses a brute-force algorithm to find the closest pair of points. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is too slow for large values of n.
3. **Incorrect implementation.** The code contains several bugs, such as using the wrong variable names and not initializing variables correctly. These bugs can cause the code to run incorrectly and produce incorrect results.
4. **Insufficient testing.** The code was not tested thoroughly enough, which allowed the bugs to go undetected. This is a common mistake that many developers make.
5. **Lack of debugging skills.** The developer was not able to debug the code effectively, which prevented them from finding and fixing the bugs. This is a common problem for developers who are new to debugging.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully consider the following:

* The correct sorting order for the points.
* The most efficient algorithm for finding the closest pair of points.
* The correct implementation of the algorithm.
* The thoroughness of the testing process.
* The debugging skills of the developer.

CODEFORCES 427_C. Checkposts

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly. For example, if you forget to read the number of junctions, your program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem is also very specific. You need to print two integers separated by a space. If you print the wrong number of integers, or if you do not separate them by a space, your program will not be accepted.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm that you use to solve this problem is very important. If you use an incorrect algorithm, your program will not be able to find the correct answer. For example, if you try to solve the problem using a brute force algorithm, your program will run very slowly and will probably time out.

**4. Incorrect data structures**

The data structures that you use to solve this problem are also very important. If you use the wrong data structures, your program will not be able to run efficiently. For example, if you try to solve the problem using a linked list, your program will run very slowly.

**5. Incorrect implementation**

CODEFORCES 450_A. Jzzhu and Children

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**

The input format is "n,m\na1,a2,...,an". But some developers may forget to add the newline character between the two parts of the input. For example, they may write "5,2 1,3,1,4,2". This will cause the program to crash.

**2. The output format is not correct**

The output format is "the number of the last child". But some developers may forget to add the newline character after the output. For example, they may write "4". This will cause the program to get a wrong answer.

**3. The program does not handle the edge cases correctly**

The problem states that "1 ≤ n ≤ 100; 1 ≤ m ≤ 100". But some developers may not check the input values to make sure that they are within the correct range. This will cause the program to crash.

**4. The program has a logic error**

The program may have a logic error that causes it to give the wrong answer. For example, the program may not correctly update the state of the children in the line. This will cause the program to give the wrong answer.

**5. The program is not efficient**

The program may be inefficient and take a long time to run. This can be caused by a number of factors, such as using a brute-force algorithm or using a data structure that is not well-suited for the problem.

CODEFORCES 472_B. Design Tutorial: Learn from Life

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct.**

The input format is "n k\nf1, f2, ..., fn", where n and k are integers and f1, f2, ..., fn are integers separated by commas. However, the input format in the problem statement is "n k\nf1 f2 ... fn". This will cause the program to crash when it tries to read the input.

**2. The program does not handle the case where there are more people than the capacity of the elevator.**

The program assumes that there are at most k people. However, if there are more than k people, the program will crash when it tries to add the last person to the elevator.

**3. The program does not handle the case where the people are not sorted by their target floors.**

The program assumes that the people are sorted by their target floors. However, if the people are not sorted, the program will not find the optimal solution.

**4. The program does not handle the case where the people's target floors are not distinct.**

The program assumes that the people's target floors are distinct. However, if the people's target floors are not distinct, the program will not find the optimal solution.

**5. The program does not handle the case where the elevator needs more than 2000 seconds to move between floors.**

The program assumes that the elevator needs at most 2000 seconds to move between floors. However, if the elevator needs more than 2000 seconds to move between floors, the program will crash.

**6. The program does not handle the case where the input is malformed.**

The program assumes that the input is well-formed. However, if the input is malformed, the program will crash.

CODEFORCES 496_C. Removing Columns

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly comparing rows.** When comparing rows, it is important to make sure that you are comparing the same columns. For example, if you are comparing the first row with the second row, you should compare the first column of the first row with the first column of the second row, and so on.
2. **Not considering all possible columns.** When trying to find the minimum number of columns to remove, you need to consider all possible columns. For example, if you are trying to find the minimum number of columns to remove from a table with 3 rows and 4 columns, you need to consider removing the first column, the second column, the third column, and the fourth column.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are many different algorithms that you can use to solve this problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. It is important to choose an algorithm that is appropriate for the size of the input data.
4. **Misunderstanding the problem statement.** The problem statement is very clear, but it is still possible to misunderstand it. Make sure that you understand the problem statement before you start working on a solution.
5. **Making a careless mistake.** Even the most experienced programmers make careless mistakes. It is important to proofread your code carefully before you submit it.

Title:
CODEFORCES 51_F. Caterpillar

Pain points:
**1. Incorrectly counting the number of connected components.**

The first step in solving this problem is to find the number of connected components in the graph. A connected component is a maximal subgraph in which every two vertices are connected by a path. One way to do this is to use a depth-first search (DFS). Starting from any vertex, visit all of its neighbors and then recursively visit all of their neighbors, and so on. If a vertex has already been visited, then it is in the same connected component as the vertex that you are currently visiting. Once you have finished visiting all of the vertices in the graph, you will know how many connected components there are.

However, there is a bug in this approach that can lead to an incorrect answer. The bug occurs when there is a cycle in the graph. In this case, the DFS will visit the same vertex multiple times, which will cause it to count the same connected component multiple times. To avoid this bug, we can use a modified version of DFS that does not visit a vertex that has already been visited.

**2. Incorrectly merging vertices.**

Once you have found the number of connected components in the graph, you need to merge the vertices in each connected component into a single vertex. To do this, you can create a new graph with one vertex for each connected component. Then, for each edge in the original graph, add an edge between the corresponding vertices in the new graph.

However, there is a bug in this approach that can lead to an incorrect answer. The bug occurs when there are two vertices in the same connected component that are not connected by an edge in the original graph. In this case, the new graph will not contain an edge between the corresponding vertices, which will prevent the graph from being a caterpillar. To avoid this bug, we can add an edge between any two vertices in the same connected component that are not connected by an edge in the original graph.

**3. Incorrectly counting the number of merging operations.**

Once you have merged the vertices in each connected component into a single vertex, you need to count the number of merging operations that were performed. To do this, you can simply count the number of edges in the new graph.

However, there is a bug in this approach that can lead to an incorrect answer. The bug occurs when there are multiple edges between two vertices in the new graph. In this case, the new graph will contain more edges than the original graph, which will lead to an incorrect count of the number of merging operations. To avoid this bug, we can only count each edge once, even if it appears multiple times in the new graph.

**4. Incorrectly printing the output.**

The final step in solving this problem is to print the minimal number of merging operations that were required to make the graph a caterpillar. To do this, you can simply print the number of edges in the new graph.

However, there is a bug in this approach that can lead to an incorrect output. The bug occurs when there are no edges in the new graph. In this case, the new graph will be a single vertex, which is not a caterpillar. To avoid this bug, we can add an edge between the new vertex and itself.

**Summary**

The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are:

* Incorrectly counting the number of connected components.
* Incorrectly merging vertices.
* Incorrectly counting the number of merging operations.
* Incorrectly printing the output.

CODEFORCES 547_B. Mike and Feet

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may not be able to parse it correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to output incorrect results. For example, if the output contains a number that is not an integer, the program may not be able to print it correctly.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating through a list of elements, it is important to make sure that the index is correct. An off-by-one error can cause the program to skip or repeat an element, which will result in incorrect results.
4. **Index out of bounds errors**. When accessing an element of a list, it is important to make sure that the index is within the bounds of the list. An index out of bounds error can cause the program to crash.
5. **Null pointer exceptions**. When a pointer is dereferenced that points to a null value, a null pointer exception will be thrown. This can cause the program to crash.
6. **Arithmetic overflow errors**. When performing arithmetic operations on large numbers, it is important to make sure that the results do not overflow. An arithmetic overflow error can cause the program to crash.
7. **Data races**. When multiple threads access the same data at the same time, it is possible for a data race to occur. A data race can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
8. **Memory leaks**. When a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed, a memory leak will occur. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
9. **Security vulnerabilities**. When a program is not properly secured, it can be vulnerable to attacks from malicious users. This can allow attackers to gain access to sensitive data or take control of the program.
10. **Performance problems**. A program that is not optimized properly can run slowly and inefficiently. This can make the program unusable for users or cause it to take too long to complete tasks.

Title:
CODEFORCES 616_E. Sum of Remainders

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**

The modulo operator `%` in Python returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand. However, in this problem, we need to find the remainder of the sum of `n` modulos, which is not the same as the modulo of `n`. For example, `10 % 3 = 1`, but `10 % 1 + 10 % 2 + 10 % 3 = 4`.

To avoid this problem, we can use the `divmod()` function, which returns the quotient and remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand. For example, `divmod(10, 3) = (3, 1)`. We can then use the remainder to calculate the sum of the modulos.

**2. Using the wrong data type**

The input and output of this problem are integers. However, if we use the `int` data type to store the sum of the modulos, it may overflow. To avoid this problem, we can use the `long` data type, which can store larger integers.

**3. Not using the modulo operator correctly**

The modulo operator `%` in Python has the following precedence:

1. Exponentiation
2. Multiplication and division
3. Addition and subtraction

This means that `a % b % c` is equivalent to `(a % b) % c`. However, in this problem, we need to find the remainder of the sum of `n` modulos, which is not the same as the modulo of the sum of `n`. For example, `(10 % 3) % 2 = 1`, but `10 % 1 + 10 % 2 + 10 % 3 = 4`.

To avoid this problem, we can use parentheses to explicitly group the operations. For example, `(10 % 3) % 2 = (10 % 3) % 2`.

**4. Not handling negative numbers correctly**

The modulo operator `%` in Python returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand. However, if the left operand is negative, the result is not always the same as the remainder of the positive number divided by the right operand. For example, `-10 % 3 = -1`, but `10 % 3 = 1`.

To avoid this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. If the left operand is negative, we can first add the absolute value of the right operand to the left operand.
2. We can then use the modulo operator to find the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.
3. We can then subtract the absolute value of the right operand from the result to get the final answer.

For example, `-10 % 3 = (-10 + 3) % 3 = 0`.

**5. Not using the correct modulus**

The modulus in this problem is `109 + 7`. However, if we use the wrong modulus, the result may not be correct. For example, if we use the modulus `100`, the result of `10 % 1 + 10 % 2 + 10 % 3 = 10`.

To avoid this problem, we can explicitly specify the modulus in the `%` operator. For example, `10 % 100 = 10`.

2. **Incorrect choice of root node.** The root node of the tree also affects the minimum ai of the first k nodes. Jacob should choose the root node that minimizes the minimum ai of the first k nodes.
3. **Incorrectly handling nodes with multiple neighbors.** When a node has multiple neighbors, the order in which the neighbors are traversed affects the minimum ai of the first k nodes. Jacob should traverse the neighbors in a way that minimizes the minimum ai of the first k nodes.
4. **Incorrectly handling cycles in the tree.** If the tree contains cycles, the DFS traversal may not terminate. Jacob should either remove the cycles from the tree or handle them correctly in the DFS traversal.
5. **Incorrectly handling duplicate edges in the tree.** If the tree contains duplicate edges, the DFS traversal may not visit all the nodes in the tree. Jacob should either remove the duplicate edges from the tree or handle them correctly in the DFS traversal.

**2. Incorrect calculation of maximum score**

The maximum score for each problem is calculated based on the number of participants who solved the problem. However, the problem statement does not specify how to handle ties. This could lead to the developer incorrectly calculating the maximum score and making a mistake.

**3. Incorrect calculation of overall score**

The overall score of a participant is calculated by adding the points they earned for each problem and the points they earned for each successful hack. However, the problem statement does not specify how to handle ties. This could lead to the developer incorrectly calculating the overall score and making a mistake.

**4. Incorrect calculation of the best place**

The best place that a developer can take is calculated by adding one to the number of participants who have a higher overall score than the developer. However, the problem statement does not specify how to handle ties. This could lead to the developer incorrectly calculating the best place and making a mistake.

**5. Incorrect handling of hacked solutions**

The problem statement states that the maximum score for a problem will change if a solution is hacked. However, it does not specify how to handle this change. This could lead to the developer incorrectly handling hacked solutions and making a mistake.

**6. Incorrect handling of multiple hacks**

The problem statement states that the developer can make multiple hacks. However, it does not specify how to handle this. This could lead to the developer incorrectly handling multiple hacks and making a mistake.

Title:
CODEFORCES 756_B. Travel Card

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm.** The greedy algorithm used to find the optimal set of tickets may not always find the optimal solution. This can happen if the algorithm does not take into account all possible combinations of tickets.
* **Incorrect handling of overflows.** The input data may contain very large values, which can cause overflows if they are not handled correctly. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
* **Incorrect use of pointers.** Pointers are a powerful tool, but they can also be a source of errors. If pointers are not used correctly, they can lead to memory corruption or other problems.
* **Incorrect use of dynamic memory.** Dynamic memory is a powerful tool, but it can also be a source of errors. If dynamic memory is not used correctly, it can lead to memory leaks or other problems.
* **Incorrect error handling.** The program should be able to handle errors gracefully. If errors are not handled correctly, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 777_C. Alyona and Spreadsheet

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input data. For example, if the input contains a number that is too large, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when writing the output data. For example, if the output contains a character that is not allowed in the output, the program may crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect. For example, the program may not correctly check if the table is sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program may not release memory that it has allocated, which can lead to a memory leak.
5. **Race conditions**. The program may not be thread-safe, which can lead to errors if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may contain security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or SQL injection attacks.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design the program and to test it thoroughly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 802_A. Heidi and Library (easy)

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct.**

The input format should be two integers n and k, followed by a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an. However, the input format in the problem statement is incorrect. It should be "n k\n a1 a2 ... an" instead of "n k a1 a2 ... an".

**2. The output format is not correct.**

The output format should be a single integer, which is the minimum cost of buying books at the store so as to satisfy all requests. However, the output format in the problem statement is incorrect. It should be "ans" instead of "3".

**3. The problem is not well-defined.**

The problem is not well-defined because it does not specify what happens if Heidi buys a book that she already has. Does she get rid of the old book? Does she keep both books? The problem statement does not say.

**4. The problem is too easy.**

The problem is too easy because the optimal solution is always to buy the books in the order they are requested. There is no need to think about which books to get rid of or when to buy them.

**5. The problem is too hard.**

The problem is too hard because it is not clear how to find the optimal solution. There are many possible solutions, and it is not clear which one is the best.

Title:
CODEFORCES 822_C. Hacker, pack your bags!

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or it may contain a string instead of a number. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect variable type.** The variable type may not be correct for the data that is being stored in it. For example, a variable that is declared as an integer may be used to store a string. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect variable initialization.** The variable may not be initialized correctly. For example, a variable that is used to store a number may be initialized with a string. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program may be incorrect. For example, the program may not be able to find the minimum cost of two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The program may not handle errors correctly. For example, the program may not handle the case where there are no two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect output.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format, variable types, variable initialization, logic, and error handling.

Title:
CODEFORCES 847_H. Load Testing

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains a list of integers. If you use the wrong data type to store the input, you may get a runtime error. For example, if you use a list of strings to store the input, you will get a runtime error when you try to access the elements of the list.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The problem asks you to find the minimum number of additional requests that Polycarp must make so that the load is strictly increasing in the beginning and then strictly decreasing afterwards. A naive algorithm would be to iterate through the list of requests and add 1 to each request. This algorithm would work, but it would be very inefficient. A more efficient algorithm would be to use a dynamic programming approach.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement mentions a few edge cases. For example, the load testing can last for 0 minutes. If you do not handle this edge case, your program will crash. Another edge case is that the list of requests can be empty. If you do not handle this edge case, your program will return an incorrect answer.

**4. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it to Codeforces. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed. You can test your code on a few small test cases to make sure that it is working correctly. You can also use a tool like Codeforces's interactive problem solver to test your code on larger test cases.

**5. Submitting your code too late**

The deadline for submitting your code to Codeforces is usually 24 hours after the problem is released. If you submit your code after the deadline, you will not be able to compete in the contest. It is important to submit your code early so that you have enough time to fix any bugs that you may find.

Title:
CODEFORCES 992_A. Nastya and an Array

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always strictly followed, and this can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a space between two integers, the program may incorrectly parse the input and produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect variable type**. The type of a variable must be declared correctly, or the program may produce incorrect results. For example, if a variable is declared as an integer but is assigned a floating-point value, the program may produce incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect operator precedence**. The order of operations in a mathematical expression is important, and errors in operator precedence can lead to incorrect results. For example, the expression `1 + 2 * 3` evaluates to 7, but the expression `1 + (2 * 3)` evaluates to 9.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to errors in the program's logic and incorrect results.
5. **Arithmetic overflow**. Arithmetic overflow occurs when a mathematical operation results in a value that is larger than the maximum value that can be represented by the variable type. This can lead to incorrect results or even a program crash.
6. **Memory errors**. Memory errors can occur when a program allocates too much or too little memory, or when it frees memory that is still in use. This can lead to program crashes or incorrect results.
7. **Synchronization errors**. Synchronization errors can occur when multiple threads or processes access the same data at the same time. This can lead to data corruption or incorrect results.
8. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when the outcome of a program depends on the order in which two or more events occur. This can lead to incorrect results or even a program crash.
9. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads or processes are waiting for each other to release a resource, and this results in a situation where no thread or process can continue. This can lead to a program crash or a system freeze.
10. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can occur when a program is not properly protected against malicious attacks. This can allow attackers to gain access to sensitive data or even take control of the system.

Title:
HACKEREARTH grab-the-laddu

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The problem states that `a` and `b` are integers, but the solution code defines them as strings. This will cause a `TypeError` when the code is run.
2. **Incorrect operator precedence**. The solution code uses the `or` operator to check if `a` or `b` is equal to 0. However, the `or` operator has a higher precedence than the `+` operator, so the code will actually check if `a + b` is equal to 0. This will cause the code to incorrectly return `Chutki` even if `a` or `b` is not equal to 0.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The solution code checks if `a + b` is equal to 1, but the problem states that `a + b` must be greater than or equal to 1. This will cause the code to incorrectly return `Chutki` even if `a + b` is equal to 1.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The solution code assumes that if `a + b` is greater than or equal to 1, then `Chutki` should play first. However, this is not always true. For example, if `a` is equal to 1 and `b` is equal to 2, then `Chutki` should play second.

To fix these problems, the following changes can be made to the solution code:

1. Change the variable type of `a` and `b` to `int`.
2. Use parentheses to explicitly group the operands of the `or` operator.
3. Check if `a` or `b` is equal to 0, rather than `a + b`.
4. Correct the logic so that `Chutki` plays first if `a + b` is greater than or equal to 1, and `Bheem` plays first otherwise.

HACKEREARTH little-jhool-and-his-punishment

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable names.** The variable names `tc`, `n`, `b`, and `g` are not descriptive and could be confusing. For example, `tc` could be mistaken for `t`, `n` could be mistaken for `b`, and `b` could be mistaken for `g`.
2. **Incorrect data types.** The variable `n` should be an integer, but it is currently a string.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic for determining who wins is incorrect.
4. **Missing error handling.** The code does not handle errors gracefully.
5. **Inefficient code.** The code could be more efficient.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer may accidentally use the variable `n` to refer to the number of boys instead of the total number of students. This would result in an incorrect answer.
* The developer may accidentally use the variable `b` to refer to the number of girls instead of the number of boys. This would also result in an incorrect answer.
* The developer may incorrectly calculate the number of pairs of neighboring students of the same gender. For example, the developer may count a pair of students as being of the same gender even if they are not actually sitting next to each other. This would result in an incorrect answer.
* The developer may incorrectly calculate the number of pairs of neighboring students of the opposite gender. For example, the developer may count a pair of students as being of the opposite gender even if they are not actually sitting next to each other. This would also result in an incorrect answer.
* The developer may not handle errors gracefully. For example, the developer may not handle the case where the input is invalid. This could result in the code crashing or producing incorrect output.
* The developer may write inefficient code. For example, the developer may use a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem, which could be very slow.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer. The developer should check the input format and handle incorrect input gracefully.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correct. For example, the output may contain a number that is not an integer. The developer should check the output format and handle incorrect output gracefully.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. This can lead to incorrect results. The developer should carefully design the algorithm and test it thoroughly.
4. **Memory leak**. The developer may not release memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually crash the program. The developer should use a garbage collector or manually release memory when it is no longer needed.
5. **Synchronization issues**. The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data. This can lead to race conditions, which can corrupt data or cause the program to crash. The developer should use locks or other synchronization mechanisms to ensure that only one thread can access shared data at a time.
6. **Exception handling**. The developer may not handle exceptions properly. This can lead to the program crashing or behaving incorrectly when an exception is thrown. The developer should catch exceptions and handle them gracefully.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer may introduce security vulnerabilities into the program. This can allow attackers to access sensitive data or take control of the program. The developer should carefully design the program to protect against security vulnerabilities.

**1. Using the wrong data type:** The input consists of integers, so you should use `int` or `long` to store the values of `A` and `B`. Using a floating-point type like `float` or `double` will cause problems when computing the factorials of large numbers.
2. **Off-by-one errors:** When computing the factorial of a number, it is important to remember that `0! = 1`. This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect factorial calculation:** The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, `5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120`. It is important to be careful when calculating factorials, as even a small mistake can lead to a wrong answer.
4. **Incorrect unit digit calculation:** The unit digit of a number is the last digit of the number. For example, the unit digit of `12345` is `5`. It is important to be able to identify the unit digit of a number, as this is the key to solving this problem.
5. **Incorrect output formatting:** The output should be a single digit, representing the unit digit of the sum of the factorials of all numbers between `A` and `B`. It is important to make sure that the output is formatted correctly, as any errors here will result in a wrong answer.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may not have the correct number of elements, or the elements may not be of the correct type.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correctly followed. For example, the output may not have the correct number of digits, or the digits may not be in the correct order.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the logic may not account for all possible cases or may make incorrect assumptions.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Indexing errors**. Indexing errors occur when a programmer accesses an element of an array or list using an incorrect index. This can lead to incorrect results.
6. **Null pointer exceptions**. Null pointer exceptions occur when a programmer attempts to access a null pointer. This can lead to a program crash.
7. **Arithmetic overflow errors**. Arithmetic overflow errors occur when a programmer performs an arithmetic operation that results in a value that is too large to represent. This can lead to incorrect results or a program crash.
8. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when a programmer allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to a program running out of memory and crashing.
9. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads attempt to access a shared resource at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or a program crash.
10. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can lead to a program being unable to continue execution.

Title:
HACKEREARTH sunny-arpit-and-kunal

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The variable `A,B,C` should be of type `int`, but the input is of type `string`. This will cause a `TypeError`.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator:** The comparison operator `<=` should be used instead of `==` to check if two numbers are equal. This will cause a `ValueError`.
3. **Incorrect logic:** The logic for calculating the maximum number of moves is incorrect. The correct logic is to find the minimum of the absolute values of the differences between each pair of numbers.
4. **Off-by-one error:** The output should be one less than the maximum number of moves, because the game ends when two of the players are at the same position.

Title:
HACKEREARTH what-is-the-maximum-distance-that-you-can-cover-505

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is not very clear. It is not clear whether the speeds and fuel consumptions are given in kilometers per hour or in miles per hour. It is also not clear whether the fuel consumption is given in liters or in milliliters. This can lead to errors in the solution.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum distance**. The maximum distance that the car can travel is given by the formula `distance = fuel / consumption`. However, it is important to note that the fuel consumption is given in liters per hour, while the distance is given in kilometers. This means that we need to convert the fuel consumption to kilometers per liter before we can calculate the maximum distance.
3. **Incorrect rounding of the final answer**. The final answer should be rounded to three digits after the decimal point. This can be done using the `round()` function in Python.
4. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers**. Floating-point numbers are often used to represent real numbers in programming. However, it is important to remember that floating-point numbers are not exact representations of real numbers. This can lead to errors in the calculation of the maximum distance.
5. **Incorrect use of the `max()` function**. The `max()` function returns the largest value in a list. However, it is important to note that the `max()` function does not work with floating-point numbers. This can lead to errors in the calculation of the maximum distance.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the input format and to correctly calculate the maximum distance. It is also important to correctly round the final answer and to use the `round()` function to avoid errors. Finally, it is important to use the `max()` function correctly to avoid errors.

Title:
ATCODER p02622 AtCoder Beginner Contest 172 - Minor Change

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the `ord()` function.** The `ord()` function returns the ASCII code of a character. For example, `ord('a')` returns 97. However, if you try to use `ord()` on a string, you will get an error. For example, the following code will not work:

```python
>>> ord('abc')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: ord() expected a character, but string of length 3 found
```

To avoid this error, you can use the `list()` function to convert the string to a list of characters, and then use the `ord()` function on each character in the list. For example:

```python
>>> list('abc')
['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> ord('a')
97
>>> ord('b')
98
>>> ord('c')
99
```

2. **Incorrect use of the `count()` function.** The `count()` function returns the number of times a substring appears in a string. For example, the following code will return the number of times the substring `'ab'` appears in the string `'abcdef'`:

```python
>>> 'abcdef'.count('ab')
2
```

However, if you try to use `count()` on a string that does not contain the substring, you will get a `ValueError` error. For example, the following code will not work:

```python
>>> 'abcdef'.count('xyz')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: substring not found
```

To avoid this error, you can use the `in` operator to check if the substring is in the string before using the `count()` function. For example:

```python
>>> if 'xyz' in 'abcdef':
...     print('The substring "xyz" appears in the string.')
... else:
...     print('The substring "xyz" does not appear in the string.')
The substring "xyz" does not appear in the string.
```

3. **Incorrect use of the `difflib.SequenceMatcher` class.** The `difflib.SequenceMatcher` class can be used to find the differences between two sequences. For example, the following code will find the differences between the strings `'abcdef'` and `'abxef'`:

```python
>>> from difflib import SequenceMatcher
>>> sm = SequenceMatcher(None, 'abcdef', 'abxef')
>>> sm.ratio()
0.8
```

The `ratio()` method returns a number between 0 and 1 that indicates how similar the two sequences are. A ratio of 1 indicates that the two sequences are identical, while a ratio of 0 indicates that the two sequences are completely different.

However, if you try to use the `difflib.SequenceMatcher` class on two strings that are not of the same length, you will get an error. For example, the following code will not work:

```python
>>> from difflib import SequenceMatcher
>>> sm = SequenceMatcher(None, 'abcdef', 'abxef')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/usr/lib/python3.8/difflib.py", line 271, in __init__
    raise ValueError("sequences must have the same length")
ValueError: sequences must have the same length
```

To avoid this error, you can use the `len()` function to check if the two sequences are of the same length before using the `difflib.SequenceMatcher` class. For example:

```python
>>> from difflib import SequenceMatcher
>>> if len('abcdef') == len('abxef'):
...     sm = SequenceMatcher(None, 'abcdef', 'abxef')
... else:
...     raise ValueError("sequences must have the same length")
```

2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be either "Yes" or "No", but the output may contain other characters.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The problem states that there will be a bus service connecting each pair of a station operated by Company A and one operated by Company B. However, the solution may not consider all possible pairs of stations.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** The solution may incorrectly count the number of stations operated by Company A or Company B.
5. **Memory errors.** The solution may not allocate enough memory to store the input or output.
6. **Time errors.** The solution may run too slowly for large inputs.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the solution with a variety of inputs to ensure that it works correctly.

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**

The input format is given as follows:

```
N
L_1 L_2 ... L_N
```

However, the following input is not correct:

```
N L_1 L_2 ... L_N
```

This will cause the program to crash.

**2. The output format is not correct**

The output format is given as follows:

```
The number of different triangles that can be formed.
```

However, the following output is not correct:

```
The number of different triangles that can be formed
```

This will cause the program to output an incorrect answer.

**3. The program does not account for all possible cases**

The program only accounts for the case where all of the sticks are distinct. However, it is also possible that some of the sticks are the same length. In this case, the program will output an incorrect answer.

**4. The program is not efficient**

The program uses a brute-force approach to solve the problem. This means that it checks every possible combination of sticks to see if they can form a triangle. This can be very time-consuming for large inputs.

**5. The program has a bug**

The program has a bug where it does not correctly account for the case where two sticks are the same length. This can cause the program to output an incorrect answer.

Title:
ATCODER p03023 M-SOLUTIONS Programming Contest - Sum of Interior Angles

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input type**. The input is an integer, but the developer may mistakenly read it as a string. This would cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The sum of the interior angles of a regular polygon is (n-2)*180 degrees, where n is the number of sides. The developer may forget to subtract 2 from n, or they may use the wrong formula. This would result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be an integer representing the sum of the interior angles in degrees. The developer may accidentally print the answer in degrees and minutes, or they may forget to print the answer at all. This would result in a incorrect or incomplete output.
4. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:
    * Using the wrong data type for the input or output
    * Making a logic error in the calculation
    * Using an incorrect formula
    * Failing to handle errors correctly
    * Not testing the code thoroughly

By following the tips below, you can help to avoid these common problems and bugs:

1. **Use the correct data type for the input and output.** The input is an integer, so you should use the `int` data type to read it. The output should be an integer representing the sum of the interior angles in degrees, so you should use the `int` data type to print it.
2. **Check your calculations carefully.** The sum of the interior angles of a regular polygon is (n-2)*180 degrees, where n is the number of sides. Make sure you subtract 2 from n before multiplying by 180.
3. **Use the correct output format.** The output should be an integer representing the sum of the interior angles in degrees. Do not print the answer in degrees and minutes, and do not forget to print the answer at all.
4. **Test your code thoroughly.** Write a series of test cases to verify that your code is working correctly. Test cases should include both valid and invalid inputs.
5. **Use a debugger to find and fix bugs.** If your code is not working correctly, use a debugger to help you find and fix the problem. A debugger can help you to track down the source of the error and to identify the incorrect code.

Title:
ATCODER p03164 Educational DP Contest - Knapsack 2

Pain points:
**1. Using a brute force approach**

A brute force approach to this problem would be to iterate over all possible combinations of items to take, and then find the combination that has the highest total value. This approach would be very inefficient, as the number of possible combinations grows exponentially with the number of items.

**2. Using a dynamic programming approach**

A more efficient approach to this problem is to use a dynamic programming algorithm. Dynamic programming algorithms work by building up a table of solutions to subproblems, and then using these solutions to find the solution to the overall problem. In this case, the subproblems would be finding the maximum possible sum of values for a knapsack of a given capacity, with a given set of items. The solution to the overall problem would then be the maximum value of all of the subproblems.

**3. Using a greedy approach**

A greedy approach to this problem would be to sort the items by their value-to-weight ratio, and then to take the items from the top of the list until the knapsack is full. This approach would not always find the optimal solution, but it would be much faster than a brute force approach.

**4. Using a branch and bound approach**

A branch and bound approach to this problem would be to start by considering all possible combinations of items to take. Then, for each combination, we would calculate the total value of the items in the combination, and the total weight of the items in the combination. If the total weight of the items in the combination is greater than the capacity of the knapsack, then we would discard the combination. Otherwise, we would continue to consider the combination. We would repeat this process until we have found all of the combinations that meet the capacity constraint. The combination with the highest total value would be the optimal solution.

**5. Using a heuristic approach**

A heuristic approach to this problem would be to use a rule of thumb to find a good solution. One possible heuristic would be to take the items with the highest values, regardless of their weights. Another possible heuristic would be to take the items with the highest value-to-weight ratios.

**6. Using a hybrid approach**

A hybrid approach to this problem would be to use a combination of different techniques. For example, we could use a dynamic programming algorithm to find the optimal solution for a small knapsack, and then use a greedy approach to find a good solution for a larger knapsack.

Title:
ATCODER p03954 AtCoder Grand Contest 006 - Median Pyramid Hard

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the median calculation algorithm.** The median is the middle value in a sorted list. To calculate the median of a list of numbers, you can sort the list and then take the middle value. However, if the list has an even number of elements, there is no single middle value. In this case, you can take the average of the two middle values.

**2. Using an incorrect data structure to store the blocks.** The blocks in the pyramid can be represented as a tree, where each node in the tree represents a block. The root node represents the block at the top of the pyramid, and each child node represents a block that is directly below its parent node.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm to traverse the tree.** To find the integer written into the block of step 1, you need to traverse the tree from the root node to the leaf node that represents the block of step 1. There are a few different ways to traverse a tree, but the most common way is to use a depth-first search algorithm.

**4. Insufficient error handling.** The input to this problem is a list of numbers. If the input list is not a valid list of numbers, the program will crash. You should check the input list for errors before you try to process it.

**5. Using incorrect variable names.** The variable names you use should be descriptive and easy to understand. Using cryptic or ambiguous variable names can make your code difficult to read and debug.

**6. Not commenting your code.** Comments are an important part of any code, and they can help other developers understand what your code is doing. Make sure to comment your code so that other developers can understand it.

**7. Using global variables.** Global variables are variables that are accessible from anywhere in your code. Using global variables can make your code difficult to read and debug. It is better to use local variables whenever possible.

**8. Not using unit tests.** Unit tests are small pieces of code that test individual parts of your program. Unit tests can help you catch bugs early in the development process. Make sure to write unit tests for your code so that you can catch bugs before they cause problems.

Title:
AIZU p00044 Prime Number II

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly checking if a number is prime.** A common mistake is to check if a number is prime by dividing it by all numbers from 2 to the square root of the number. However, this is not always correct, as some numbers, such as 11, are only divisible by 1 and themselves, but are not prime because they are divisible by 11^2.
2. **Using an incorrect algorithm to find the largest prime number less than a given number.** The most efficient algorithm for finding the largest prime number less than a given number is the Sieve of Eratosthenes. This algorithm works by first creating a list of all the numbers from 2 to the given number. It then iteratively marks off all the multiples of each number in the list, starting with 2. The last number in the list that is not marked off is the largest prime number less than the given number.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm to find the smallest prime number greater than a given number.** The most efficient algorithm for finding the smallest prime number greater than a given number is the Trial Division algorithm. This algorithm works by iteratively dividing the given number by all the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of the number. The first number that is not divisible by any of the prime numbers is the smallest prime number greater than the given number.
4. **Not handling invalid input correctly.** The input for this problem is a single integer. If the input is not a valid integer, the program should print an error message and exit.
5. **Not handling overflow errors correctly.** The input for this problem can be as large as 50,000. If the input is larger than the maximum value that can be represented by the data type being used, the program should print an error message and exit.
6. **Not handling floating-point errors correctly.** The square root of a number can be a floating-point number. If the square root of the given number is a floating-point number, the program should round it to the nearest integer.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is "#RGB", but the input may contain invalid characters. For example, "#rgb" or "#ffgee".
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be the name of the closest color from the color table. For example, "white" or "black".
3. **Incorrect calculation of the closest color**. The closest color is defined as the color with the smallest dk value. However, the developer may incorrectly calculate the dk value.
4. **Incorrect handling of ties**. If there are multiple colors with the same dk value, the color at the top of the table should be the closest color. However, the developer may incorrectly output a different color.
5. **Incorrect handling of the end of input**. The end of input is indicated by a single line of zeros. However, the developer may not correctly check for the end of input.

**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input format is not clear. Does the input start with a number or a letter? What does the letter E represent?
* The output format is not clear. Does the output start with a number or a letter? What does the letter M, T, S, and H represent?
* The program may not handle invalid input correctly. For example, what if the input year is not in the range 1868-2016?
* The program may not handle all possible cases. For example, what if the input year is 2017?
* The program may be inefficient. For example, it may use a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem.

Here are some possible solutions to these problems:

* The input format can be made clearer by using a regular expression. For example, the input could be in the format `^(0|1|2|3|4) (1868|1912|1926|1989)?$`.
* The output format can be made clearer by using a docstring. For example, the docstring could be `"""Converts a year from the Western calendar to the Japanese calendar or vice versa.

Args:
  year (int): The year to convert.
  era (int): The era to convert the year to.

Returns:
  int: The converted year.
"""`
* The program can be tested with unit tests. For example, the following unit test would check that the program correctly converts the year 1912 to the Meiji era:

```python
def test_convert_year_to_japanese_calendar():
  assert convert_year_to_japanese_calendar(1912, 1) == 'T1'
```
* The program can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm. For example, the program could use a lookup table to map years to eras.

Here is an example of a program that solves this problem:

```python
import re

def convert_year_to_japanese_calendar(year, era):
  """Converts a year from the Western calendar to the Japanese calendar or vice versa.

  Args:
    year (int): The year to convert.
    era (int): The era to convert the year to.

  Returns:
    int: The converted year.
  """

  if era == 0:
    if year >= 1868 and year <= 1911:
      return 'M' + str(year - 1867)
    elif year >= 1912 and year <= 1925:
      return 'T' + str(year - 1911)
    elif year >= 1926 and year <= 1988:
      return 'S' + str(year - 1925)
    elif year >= 1989 and year <= 2016:
      return 'H' + str(year - 1988)
  elif era == 1:
    return 1868 + year
  elif era == 2:
    return 1912 + year
  elif era == 3:
    return 1926 + year
  elif era == 4:
    return 1989 + year
  else:
    raise ValueError('Invalid era: {}'.format(era))

AIZU p00513 Available Areas

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the number of rooms may be negative, or the areas may not be in ascending order.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The areas may be entered as strings instead of integers.
3. **Arithmetic overflow**. The areas may be too large for the integer data type to represent.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer may accidentally count the number of rooms incorrectly, or may miss a room when iterating over the list of areas.
5. **Logic errors**. The developer may incorrectly implement the algorithm for checking whether an area is valid.
6. **Memory leaks**. The developer may not free up memory that is no longer needed, which can lead to a memory leak.
7. **Race conditions**. The developer may not synchronize access to shared data, which can lead to incorrect results.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer may not properly validate user input, which can allow attackers to exploit the program.

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect distance calculation.** The distance between two login names is calculated by considering the following four operations: deleting a character, inserting a character, replacing a character, and swapping two adjacent characters. It is important to ensure that all of these operations are correctly accounted for when calculating the distance.
* **Incorrect sorting of pairs.** The output of the program should be sorted by the alphabetically preceding login name. It is important to ensure that this sorting is done correctly.
* **Incorrect counting of pairs.** The output of the program should include the total number of confusing pairs in the dataset. It is important to ensure that this count is correct.

Here are some additional tips for debugging this problem:

* Use a debugger to step through the code and watch the values of variables change. This can help to identify errors in the logic of the program.
* Use unit tests to test the individual components of the program. This can help to identify errors in the implementation of the program.
* Use a code review to get feedback on the design and implementation of the program. This can help to identify potential problems before they cause errors in production.

AIZU p01547 Final Defense Line

Pain points:
Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly calculating the distance between two points.** This could lead to the developer underestimating the damage that an unidentified creature will cause to an important facility.
* **Not taking into account the fact that the concentration of gas can only be kept constant.** This could lead to the developer overestimating the damage that an unidentified creature will cause to an important facility.
* **Not considering the fact that the invasion route of unidentified organisms shall not include the vertices of polygons and intersections with other polygons.** This could lead to the developer overestimating the damage that an unidentified creature will cause to an important facility.
* **Not considering the fact that unidentified organisms do not invade along the sides of the polygon.** This could lead to the developer underestimating the damage that an unidentified creature will cause to an important facility.

By carefully considering these potential problems and bugs, developers can write code that correctly solves the problem.

Title:
AIZU p01703 Speedrun

Pain points:
**Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs:**

* **Incorrect Input:** The input format is not correct. For example, the number of checkpoints $n$ is not an integer, or the winning probabilities $p_i$ are not in the correct range.
* **Incorrect Calculation:** The expected time is not calculated correctly. For example, the expected time is not minimized, or the relative error is too large.
* **Memory Leak:** The program uses too much memory. This can be caused by allocating too much memory, or by not freeing memory that is no longer needed.
* **Time Complexity:** The program runs too slowly. This can be caused by using inefficient algorithms, or by using too much time in loops or recursive functions.
* **Incorrect Output:** The output is not correct. For example, the output is not in the correct format, or the output does not match the expected results.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems and bugs:

* **Test your code thoroughly:** Before submitting your code, make sure that you have tested it thoroughly. This includes testing for incorrect input, incorrect calculation, memory leaks, time complexity, and incorrect output.
* **Use efficient algorithms:** Use efficient algorithms to minimize the running time of your program. This includes using sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and graph algorithms.
* **Use memory efficiently:** Use memory efficiently to minimize the amount of memory that your program uses. This includes using data structures that are designed for efficient memory usage, and avoiding unnecessary memory allocations.
* **Optimize your code:** Optimize your code to improve the running time and memory usage. This includes removing unnecessary code, and using compiler optimizations.

Title:
AIZU p01847 Curtain

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of vertices of the window is not between 4 and 100, or if the coordinates of the vertices are not in the correct range, the program may crash.
* **Incorrect calculation of the area of the window**. The area of the window is calculated by summing the areas of the triangles formed by the vertices of the window. However, if the vertices are not in the correct order, or if the triangles are not convex, the area may be calculated incorrectly.
* **Incorrect calculation of the area of the curtain**. The area of the curtain is calculated by summing the areas of the rectangles formed by the vertices of the curtain. However, if the vertices are not in the correct order, or if the rectangles are not convex, the area may be calculated incorrectly.
* **Incorrect calculation of the intersection area**. The intersection area is calculated by subtracting the area of the curtain from the area of the window. However, if the intersection area is negative, the program may crash.
* **Incorrect output**. The output should be the area of the window not covered by the curtain, but if the area is not an integer, the program may output the wrong answer.

To avoid these problems, the following should be considered:

* The input format should be strictly followed.
* The area of the window should be calculated correctly.
* The area of the curtain should be calculated correctly.
* The intersection area should be calculated correctly.
* The output should be the area of the window not covered by the curtain.

Title:
AIZU p01983 Proof of Knowledge

Pain points:
**Possible Problems and Bugs**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when writing it. For example, if you forget to put a space between the hash function formula and the password, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
* **Incorrect hash function:** The hash function used in this problem is a bit complex, and it is easy to make a mistake when implementing it. For example, if you forget to apply the correct operator to two hash values, the program will not be able to calculate the correct hash value.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is also very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when writing it. For example, if you forget to put a space between the hash value and the number of passwords, the program will not be able to parse the output correctly.
* **Infinite loop:** The program could enter an infinite loop if it is not careful. For example, if the program tries to calculate the hash value of a password that is not in the correct format, it will keep looping forever.
* **Memory leak:** The program could leak memory if it is not careful. For example, if the program does not free up memory that it is no longer using, it will eventually run out of memory.

**How to Avoid These Problems**

* To avoid incorrect input format, make sure to carefully read the instructions and follow them exactly.
* To avoid incorrect hash function, carefully read the documentation and make sure that you understand how the hash function works.
* To avoid incorrect output format, carefully read the instructions and make sure that you are following them exactly.
* To avoid infinite loops, carefully check your code for any potential errors that could cause the program to loop forever.
* To avoid memory leaks, make sure to free up any memory that you are no longer using.

Title:
AIZU p02417 Counting Characters

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of letters.** One common mistake is to incorrectly count the number of letters in a string. For example, if the string is "abc", you might count the number of letters as 3, when it is actually 4. This is because the letter "a" is counted twice.
2. **Ignoring the case of characters.** Another common mistake is to ignore the case of characters when counting the number of letters. For example, if the string is "ABC", you might count the number of letters as 3, when it is actually 6. This is because the letters "A" and "B" are both counted twice.
3. **Using the wrong data type.** Another common mistake is to use the wrong data type to store the number of letters. For example, if you are counting the number of letters in a string, you should use an integer data type, not a string data type. This is because an integer data type can store whole numbers, while a string data type can only store text.
4. **Not handling invalid input.** Another common mistake is not handling invalid input. For example, if the user enters a string that contains non-alphabetic characters, your program should not crash. Instead, it should handle the invalid input gracefully.
5. **Not using a robust algorithm.** Another common mistake is not using a robust algorithm to count the number of letters. For example, if the string is very long, your algorithm should not take a long time to run. Instead, it should use a more efficient algorithm.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these common problems:

* Use a good programming language. Some programming languages are better suited for string manipulation than others. For example, Python has a number of built-in functions that make it easy to count the number of letters in a string.
* Use a good algorithm. There are a number of different algorithms that you can use to count the number of letters in a string. Some algorithms are more efficient than others.
* Test your code thoroughly. Before you deploy your code to production, you should test it thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly. This will help you catch any bugs before they cause problems for your users.
