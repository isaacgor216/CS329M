Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the factorial function.** The factorial function is a recursive function that can be implemented in a variety of ways. However, it is important to make sure that the function is implemented correctly, as a bug in the factorial function could lead to incorrect results.
2. **Using the wrong modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) is used to find the remainder of a division operation. However, it is important to make sure that the modulo operator is used correctly, as a bug in the modulo operator could lead to incorrect results.
3. **Using the wrong data type.** The factorial function can be used to calculate the factorial of very large numbers. However, it is important to make sure that the data type used to store the factorial is large enough, as a bug in the data type could lead to incorrect results.
4. **Not handling edge cases correctly.** The factorial function has a number of edge cases that need to be handled correctly. For example, the factorial of 0 is 1, and the factorial of a negative number is undefined. It is important to make sure that these edge cases are handled correctly, as a bug in the edge case handling could lead to incorrect results.
5. **Not using efficient algorithms.** The factorial function can be calculated using a variety of algorithms. However, it is important to use an efficient algorithm, as a slow algorithm could lead to incorrect results.

Title:
CODECHEF ig01

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of common letters.** This is a common mistake that can be made when two names have multiple occurrences of the same letter. For example, if the two names are "SHILPA" and "AAMIR", then there are two occurrences of the letter "A". However, when counting the number of common letters, it is important to only count each letter once. Therefore, in this case, the number of common letters would be 1, not 2.
2. **Incorrectly calculating the nth letter in the word "FLAMES".** The nth letter in the word "FLAMES" is determined by starting at the letter "F" and counting forward in a cyclic manner. For example, the 1st letter in the word "FLAMES" is "F", the 2nd letter is "L", the 3rd letter is "A", and so on. However, it is important to remember that the 7th letter in the word "FLAMES" is "F", not "S". This is because the counting starts over at the letter "F" after the 6th letter.
3. **Incorrectly printing the output.** The output of the program should be the letter that remains after repeatedly cutting the letters in the word "FLAMES" in a cyclic manner. For example, if the two names are "SHILPA" and "AAMIR", then the output of the program should be "S".

Here are some additional tips that may help you avoid these common problems:

* Use a dictionary to keep track of the number of occurrences of each letter in each name. This will help you to correctly count the number of common letters.
* Use a formula to calculate the nth letter in the word "FLAMES". This will help you to avoid incorrectly calculating the letter.
* Use a unit test to verify that the program is correctly printing the output. This will help you to catch any errors in the program.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1043_A. Elections

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a list of integers. If we use the wrong data type to store the list, it may cause problems when we try to access the elements of the list. For example, if we use a string to store the list, we will not be able to access the elements of the list using the index operator.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. If we use an incorrect algorithm, it may not give us the correct answer. For example, we could use a brute force algorithm to solve this problem. This algorithm would iterate through all possible values of k and check if each value of k is a winning number. This algorithm would be very inefficient and would not give us the correct answer in a reasonable amount of time.

**3. Not handling edge cases correctly**

There are a few edge cases that we need to be aware of when solving this problem. For example, what if the input data is empty? What if all of the elements in the list are the same value? If we do not handle these edge cases correctly, it may cause our program to crash or give us the wrong answer.

**4. Insufficient error checking**

It is important to check for errors in the input data. For example, we should check to make sure that the input data is a valid list of integers. If we do not check for errors, it may cause our program to crash or give us the wrong answer.

**5. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. It is important to use the most efficient algorithm possible to solve this problem.

**6. Not using the best data structure**

The data structure that we use to store the input data can have a significant impact on the performance of our program. It is important to use the best data structure possible to store the input data.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1065_F. Up and Down the Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly implementing the tree traversal algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The tree traversal algorithm should visit all of the vertices in the tree in a specific order, and it is important to make sure that the algorithm is implemented correctly.
2. **Not handling the case where the token is currently at a leaf.** If the token is currently at a leaf, then the algorithm needs to be able to move up the tree to an ancestor of the leaf. This can be done by following the parent pointers until the token reaches a non-leaf vertex.
3. **Not handling the case where the token is currently at the root.** The root is not a leaf, so the algorithm needs to be able to move down the tree to a leaf. This can be done by following the child pointers until the token reaches a leaf vertex.
4. **Not handling the case where the token is trying to move up the tree too many times.** The algorithm should not allow the token to move up the tree more than k times. If the token tries to move up the tree more than k times, then the algorithm should stop and return the current number of leaves that have been visited.
5. **Not handling the case where the tree is not a valid tree.** The input should represent a valid tree, rooted at vertex 1. If the input does not represent a valid tree, then the algorithm should return an error.

CODEFORCES 1176_F. Destroy it!

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of integers, but the code is expecting a list of strings. This will cause a TypeError.

**2. Incorrect variable type**

The code is using a variable `i` to iterate over the list of cards, but `i` is declared as an integer. This will cause a ValueError.

**3. Off-by-one error**

The code is checking to see if the current card is the 10th card, but it is actually checking if the current card is the 9th card. This will cause the code to miss the 10th card and not deal double damage.

**4. Undefined variable**

The code is trying to access the variable `damage` before it has been initialized. This will cause a NameError.

**5. Unintended consequences**

The code is using a global variable to track the total damage dealt. This means that the damage dealt in one turn will affect the damage dealt in subsequent turns. This is not what the problem is asking for.

**6. Inefficient algorithm**

The code is using a brute-force algorithm to find the maximum possible damage. This algorithm is very inefficient and will not run in time for large input data sets.

**7. Incorrect logic**

The code is not taking into account the fact that the player can only use each card once. This means that the code may end up playing a card that does not contribute to the maximum possible damage.

CODEFORCES 1195_D2. Submarine in the Rybinsk Sea (hard edition)

Pain points:
### Possible problems and bugs

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is `n`, followed by a list of `n` integers. Make sure that you parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output for this problem should be a single integer, modulo 998244353. Make sure that you format your output correctly.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When computing the sum of `f(a_i, a_j)` for all pairs of `i` and `j`, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. Make sure that you are careful when computing this sum.
4. **Incorrect modulo arithmetic.** When computing the sum of `f(a_i, a_j)` modulo 998244353, it is important to use the correct modulo arithmetic. Make sure that you are using the correct operator for modulo arithmetic in your programming language.
5. **Memory errors.** This problem can be solved in O(n) time and O(n) space. However, if you are not careful with your memory usage, you may run out of memory. Make sure that you are allocating and freeing memory efficiently.
6. **Time limit exceeded.** This problem can be solved in O(n) time and O(n) space. However, if your algorithm is too slow, you may run out of time. Make sure that your algorithm is efficient enough to pass the time limit.

### Tips for solving this problem

1. To avoid off-by-one errors, it is helpful to use a data structure that stores the values of `f(a_i, a_j)` in a sorted order. This will make it easier to check if two values of `f(a_i, a_j)` are equal.
2. To avoid memory errors, it is helpful to use a data structure that reuses memory whenever possible. This will help you to avoid allocating and freeing memory unnecessarily.
3. To avoid time limit exceeded errors, it is helpful to use an efficient algorithm. The best known algorithm for this problem runs in O(n) time and O(n) space.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable initialization**. The developer may forget to initialize a variable to a specific value, which can lead to unexpected results. For example, if the developer initializes a variable to `0` but then tries to use it to store a positive number, the program will likely crash.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer may accidentally miscalculate the index of an array or other data structure, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the developer tries to access the element at index `n` of an array with only `n-1` elements, the program will likely crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may make a mistake in the logic of their code, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the developer tries to divide a number by zero, the program will likely crash.
4. **Incorrect use of functions**. The developer may use a function incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the developer tries to call a function with the wrong number of arguments, the program will likely crash.
5. **Memory leaks**. The developer may accidentally create a memory leak, which can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing. For example, if the developer creates a new object but doesn't delete it when they're finished with it, the object will remain in memory until the program terminates.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer may accidentally introduce a security vulnerability in their code, which could allow an attacker to gain access to the program's data or system. For example, if the developer allows an attacker to input arbitrary data into the program, the attacker could use that data to execute malicious code.

Pain points:
**Possible Problems**

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly followed, which may lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output. For example, if the number of nodes is not a positive integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data types of the input values may not be correctly specified, which may lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output. For example, if the weight of an edge is specified as a string, the program will crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the programmer forgets to add or subtract one from a value. This can lead to the program producing incorrect output. For example, if the program is supposed to find the minimum capacity required to move from node A to node B, but the programmer accidentally calculates the capacity required to move from node A to node B + 1, the program will produce an incorrect output.
4. **Infinite loops**. Infinite loops occur when the program enters a loop that never terminates. This can happen if the programmer makes a mistake in the loop condition or the loop body. For example, if the program is supposed to iterate over a list of numbers, but the programmer accidentally writes an infinite loop, the program will never terminate.
5. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when the program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing. For example, if the program creates a new object but does not delete it when it is no longer needed, the program will leak memory.
6. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more parts of the program try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program producing incorrect output or crashing. For example, if two threads are both trying to update the same variable at the same time, the program may produce incorrect output or crash.
7. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more parts of the program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish because it is waiting for the other. This can lead to the program running indefinitely or crashing. For example, if two threads are both waiting for each other to release a lock, the program will deadlock.

**Possible Bugs**

1. **Incorrect algorithm**. The programmer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem, which may lead to the program producing incorrect output or crashing. For example, the programmer may use a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem, which may be very inefficient and produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect implementation**. The programmer may implement the algorithm incorrectly, which may lead to the program producing incorrect output or crashing. For example, the programmer may forget to handle a special case, which may lead to the program producing incorrect output or crashing.
3. **Incorrect testing**. The programmer may not test the program adequately, which may lead to the program producing incorrect output or crashing. For example, the programmer may only test the program on a few small inputs, which may not reveal any bugs.
4. **Incorrect documentation**. The programmer may not document the program correctly, which may make it difficult for other programmers to understand how to use the program. For example, the programmer may not include a description of the program's input and output, which may make it difficult for other programmers to use the program.
5. **Incorrect deployment**. The programmer may not deploy the program correctly, which may lead to the program being used incorrectly. For example, the programmer may not provide installation instructions, which may lead to the program being installed incorrectly.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is a string, but the developer expects it to be an integer. This can lead to errors in the program's logic.
2. **Incorrect variable initialization**. The developer may forget to initialize a variable, which can lead to undefined behavior.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer may accidentally miscalculate the index of an array or string, which can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect loop conditions**. The developer may forget to check the loop condition, which can lead to an infinite loop.
5. **Incorrect use of pointers**. The developer may use pointers incorrectly, which can lead to memory errors or security vulnerabilities.
6. **Incorrect use of functions**. The developer may call a function with the wrong arguments or in the wrong order, which can lead to incorrect results.
7. **Incorrect error handling**. The developer may not handle errors correctly, which can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
8. **Incorrect code style**. The developer's code may be difficult to read and understand, which can make it more difficult to debug and maintain.
9. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer's code may contain security vulnerabilities, which can allow attackers to access sensitive data or take control of the system.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully review their code and test it thoroughly before deploying it to production.

## 1. Incorrect input format

The input format for this problem is `t n k <edges>`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of cities, `k` is the number of dead-end cities, and `<edges>` is a list of edges between cities. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly and will throw an error.

## 2. Incorrect edge list

The edge list must be a list of pairs of integers, where each pair represents an edge between two cities. If the edge list is incorrect, the program will not be able to find a valid solution to the problem.

## 3. Incorrect number of dead-end cities

The number of dead-end cities must be at least 1 and at most `n`. If the number of dead-end cities is not in this range, the program will not be able to find a valid solution to the problem.

## 4. Incorrect number of test cases

The number of test cases must be a positive integer. If the number of test cases is not a positive integer, the program will not be able to run correctly.

## 5. Incorrect output format

The output format for this problem is `Yes/No m <cities>`, where `Yes/No` indicates whether a valid solution was found, `m` is the number of cities in the solution, and `<cities>` is a list of the cities in the solution. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly output the solution.

CODEFORCES 1361_E. James and the Chase

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of data structures**

One common mistake is to use the wrong data structure to store the graph. For example, if the graph is represented as an adjacency list, then it is possible to accidentally create duplicate edges. This can lead to incorrect results.

To avoid this problem, it is important to use the correct data structure for the problem at hand. In this case, the graph is represented as an adjacency matrix. This ensures that there are no duplicate edges and that the results are correct.

**2. Incorrect implementation of algorithms**

Another common mistake is to implement algorithms incorrectly. For example, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a common algorithm for finding all shortest paths in a graph. However, if it is implemented incorrectly, it can lead to incorrect results.

To avoid this problem, it is important to carefully read the algorithm's documentation and to implement it correctly. It is also helpful to test the algorithm on small test cases to ensure that it is working correctly.

**3. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

Another common mistake is to incorrectly handle edge cases. For example, if the graph is empty, then it is important to handle this case gracefully. Otherwise, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

To avoid this problem, it is important to carefully consider all possible edge cases and to handle them appropriately. This can be done by writing unit tests or by manually testing the program on small test cases.

**4. Failure to optimize the code**

Another common mistake is to fail to optimize the code. For example, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a very inefficient algorithm. It can be improved by using a faster algorithm, such as Johnson's algorithm.

To avoid this problem, it is important to profile the code and to identify any parts that can be optimized. This can be done using a profiler or by manually inspecting the code. Once the slow parts of the code have been identified, they can be optimized to improve the overall performance of the program.

**5. Failure to comment the code**

Another common mistake is to fail to comment the code. This can make it difficult for other developers to understand the code and to debug it.

To avoid this problem, it is important to comment the code as thoroughly as possible. This should include explaining the purpose of the code, the assumptions that are made, and the steps that are taken to solve the problem.

By following these tips, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving the CODEFORCES 1361_E. James and the Chase problem.

CODEFORCES 1382_A. Common Subsequence

Pain points:
**1. Input Format**

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Next 3t lines contain descriptions of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1≤ n,m≤ 1000) — the lengths of the two arrays.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,…,a_n (1≤ a_i≤ 1000) — the elements of the first array.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1,…,b_m (1≤ b_i≤ 1000) — the elements of the second array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 1000 (∑_{i=1}^t n_i, ∑_{i=1}^t m_i≤ 1000).

**2. Output Format**

For each test case, output "YES" if a solution exists, or "NO" otherwise.

If the answer is "YES", on the next line output an integer k (1≤ k≤ 1000) — the length of the array, followed by k integers c_1,…,c_k (1≤ c_i≤ 1000) — the elements of the array.

If there are multiple solutions with the smallest possible k, output any.

**3. Constraints**

1 ≤ t ≤ 1000

CODEFORCES 1424_N. BubbleSquare Tokens

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specified in the problem statement is very strict. Make sure to read it carefully and parse the input data correctly.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over the input data, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one or more elements. Be careful to check the bounds of your loops and make sure that you don't skip any elements.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic for solving this problem is not trivial. Make sure to carefully read the problem statement and understand the constraints before you start writing your code.
4. **Memory leaks.** It is important to free up any memory that you allocate during your program's execution. If you don't do this, your program may eventually run out of memory and crash.
5. **Race conditions.** If multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is possible for them to interfere with each other and cause errors. Make sure to use locks or other synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions.
6. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specified in the problem statement is very strict. Make sure to format your output data correctly.
7. **Other bugs.** There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. Be careful to test your code thoroughly and fix any bugs that you find.

CODEFORCES 1446_D2. Frequency Problem (Hard Version)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is not very strict. For example, the following inputs are all valid:

```
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

```
10
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
```

```
10
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
```

However, if the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will likely crash.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format for this problem is also not very strict. For example, the following outputs are all valid:

```
6
```

```
06
```

```
006
```

However, if the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will likely crash.

3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program is the most important part. If the logic is incorrect, the program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.

For example, the following program is incorrect:

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

max_count = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        count = 0
        for k in range(i, j + 1):
            if a[k] == a[i]:
                count += 1
        if count > max_count:
            max_count = count

print(max_count)
```

This program will not work because it does not check if the most frequent value in the subarray is unique.

4. **Incorrect implementation**. The implementation of the program is also important. If the implementation is incorrect, the program will not be able to run correctly.

For example, the following program is incorrect:

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

max_count = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        count = 0
        for k in range(i, j + 1):
            if a[k] == a[i]:
                count += 1
        if count > max_count:
            max_count = count

print(max_count)
```

This program will not work because it does not initialize the variable `max_count` to 0.

5. **Incorrect debugging**. Debugging is an important part of the development process. If the program is not working correctly, it is important to be able to debug it and find the source of the problem.

For example, the following program is not working correctly:

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

max_count = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        count = 0
        for k in range(i, j + 1):
            if a[k] == a[i]:
                count += 1
        if count > max_count:
            max_count = count

print(max_count)
```

The problem with this program is that it is not checking if the most frequent value in the subarray is unique. To debug this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. **Print the values of `i`, `j`, and `count` in the loop.** This will help us to see if the loop is working correctly.
2. **Print the value of `max_count` after the loop.** This will help us to see if the value of `max_count` is correct.
3. **Use a debugger to step through the code.** This will allow us to see exactly what the program is doing at each step.

By following these steps, we can debug the program and find the source of the problem.

                count += 1
        if count > max_count:
            max_count = count

print(max_count)
```

4. Incorrect implementation

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

max_count = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        count = 0

CODEFORCES 151_C. Win or Freeze

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specified in the problem statement is "The first line contains the only integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 1013).". If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specified in the problem statement is "In the first line print the number of the winning player (1 or 2). If the first player wins then the second line should contain another integer — his first move (if the first player can't even make the first move, print 0). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.". If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly output the solution and will likely receive a WA (wrong answer) verdict.
3. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm used to solve the problem must be correct in order to produce the correct output. If the algorithm is incorrect, the program will likely produce the wrong answer and receive a WA verdict.

Title:
CODEFORCES 385_A. Bear and Raspberry

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is two space-separated integers, n and c, followed by n space-separated integers, x1, x2, ..., xn. However, a developer might accidentally hard-code the input format or forget to account for leading or trailing whitespace. This could result in the program crashing or producing incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect calculation of maximum profit**

The maximum profit is the difference between the price of the honey barrel on the day it is sold and the price of the honey barrel on the day it is bought, minus the cost of borrowing the barrel. A developer might accidentally use the wrong prices or forget to subtract the cost of borrowing the barrel, resulting in an incorrect answer.

**3. Off-by-one error**

When calculating the day on which the honey barrel should be sold, a developer might accidentally add one to the day instead of subtracting one. This would result in the program selling the honey barrel on the wrong day, which could lead to a loss of profit.

**4. Incorrect use of variables**

A developer might accidentally use the wrong variables when calculating the maximum profit. For example, they might use the variable x to store the price of the honey barrel on the day it is bought, when it should be used to store the price of the honey barrel on the day it is sold. This would result in an incorrect answer.

**5. Uninitialized variables**

A developer might forget to initialize variables before using them. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.

**6. Logic errors**

The logic used to calculate the maximum profit might be incorrect. For example, the developer might assume that the price of the honey barrel on the day it is sold is always greater than the price of the honey barrel on the day it is bought, when this is not always the case. This would result in an incorrect answer.

**7. Runtime errors**

The program might run into runtime errors, such as a stack overflow or a division by zero error. These errors can be caused by incorrect input, incorrect logic, or incorrect use of variables.

Title:
CODEFORCES 760_F. Bacterial Melee

Pain points:
**Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs**

1. **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is "3aaa" instead of "3aaa\n", the program will read the first character as the number of regions and the rest as the initial population, which is incorrect.
2. **Incorrect array initialization:** The array used to store the population of the testtube is not initialized correctly, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the array is initialized to all zeros, then the program will think that all regions are empty, which is incorrect.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of possible configurations:** The number of possible configurations is calculated incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program only considers the number of ways to arrange the bacteria in each region, then it will miss the possibility of multiple attacks happening in the same region.
4. **Incorrect modulo operation:** The final answer is not modulo 109 + 7, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the answer is 1000000007, the program will print 1 instead of 0.

**Other Possible Problems and Bugs**

1. **Off-by-one errors:** The program may miss one or more cases, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program only considers the case where the first colony attacks the second colony, then it will miss the case where the second colony attacks the first colony.
2. **Incorrect use of pointers:** The program may use pointers incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program passes a pointer to a local variable to a function, then the function may modify the variable after the function returns, which is incorrect.
3. **Incorrect use of dynamic memory:** The program may allocate too much or too little dynamic memory, which can lead to incorrect results or crashes. For example, if the program allocates enough memory to store the population of the testtube, then it may not be able to store the results of the calculations, which is incorrect.
4. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers:** The program may use floating-point numbers incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program uses a floating-point number to represent the number of possible configurations, then the number may be rounded incorrectly, which is incorrect.
5. **Incorrect use of bitwise operations:** The program may use bitwise operations incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program uses a bitwise AND operation to check if two bits are set, then it may miss the case where only one bit is set, which is incorrect.

4. **Incorrect use of modulo operator**. The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 is 1. A developer may incorrectly use the modulo operator to compute the number of trailing zeroes in a number.
5. **Incorrect use of bit manipulation**. Bit manipulation can be used to efficiently compute the number of trailing zeroes in a number. However, a developer may incorrectly use bit manipulation and get the wrong answer.
6. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers**. Floating-point numbers are not always precise. A developer may incorrectly use floating-point numbers to compute the number of trailing zeroes in a number and get the wrong answer.
7. **Memory errors**. A developer may allocate too much or too little memory, which can lead to errors.
8. **Timeout errors**. A developer's solution may take too long to run, which will result in a timeout error.
9. **Run-time errors**. A developer's solution may cause a run-time error, such as a division by zero error.

Title:
CODEFORCES 977_B. Two-gram

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of occurrences of a two-gram.** This is a common mistake that can be made when iterating over the string. For example, if the string is "ABAAB", you might incorrectly count the occurrences of the two-gram "AB" as 3, when it is actually only 2. To avoid this mistake, you should use a counter to keep track of the number of occurrences of each two-gram.
2. **Not considering overlapping occurrences of a two-gram.** When two occurrences of a two-gram overlap, they should only be counted once. For example, if the string is "AAAB", the two occurrences of the two-gram "AA" should only be counted as one. To avoid this mistake, you should keep track of the starting and ending positions of each two-gram.
3. **Using a brute-force approach.** A brute-force approach to this problem would be to iterate over all possible two-grams and check if they occur in the string. This approach is inefficient and will not work for large strings. A more efficient approach would be to use a hash table to store the occurrences of each two-gram.
4. **Not handling invalid inputs.** The input to this problem may contain invalid values, such as a string that is not of length 2 or a string that contains non-alphabetic characters. You should check for these invalid inputs and handle them appropriately.
5. **Not formatting your output correctly.** The output to this problem should be a two-gram, which is a string of length 2. You should make sure that your output is formatted correctly, such that it is easy for the grader to read.

4. The input string may not be divisible by 4. For example, the input string "12345" would not be valid because it is not divisible by 4.
5. The output string may not be a valid integer. For example, the output string "123.45" would not be valid because it is not a valid integer.
6. The output string may not be greater than or equal to 10^12. For example, the output string "10^13" would not be valid because it is greater than 10^12.
7. The output string may not contain any leading zeroes. For example, the output string "012345" would not be valid because it contains leading zeroes.

Title:
HACKEREARTH even-from-end-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect list indexing**. When iterating over a list, it is important to make sure that you are indexing the list correctly. In this problem, the list is being indexed from the end, so the first even number in the list will be at index -1, the second even number will be at index -2, and so on.
2. **Using the wrong data type**. The input list is a list of integers, so it is important to make sure that you are using the correct data type when iterating over the list. In this problem, the list is being iterated over using a for loop, so the data type of the loop variable should be int.
3. **Using the wrong comparison operator**. When checking if a number is even, it is important to use the correct comparison operator. In this problem, the numbers in the list are being checked to see if they are divisible by 2, so the correct comparison operator is ==.
4. **Not handling the edge cases**. In this problem, there are two edge cases that need to be handled. The first edge case is when the list is empty, and the second edge case is when there are no even numbers in the list. In both of these cases, the output should be None.
5. **Using inefficient algorithms**. There are more efficient ways to find all of the even numbers from the end of a list than the method that is used in the solution to this problem. For example, a binary search could be used to find the first even number in the list, and then the rest of the even numbers could be found by iterating over the list from that point forward.

Title:
HACKEREARTH hermione-vs-draco

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the function F(x)**

The function F(x) is defined as follows:

```
F(0) = F(1) = 1
F(x) = x * (x - 1) * F(x - 2) ; x > 1
```

A common mistake is to forget to check the condition x > 1. This can lead to incorrect results, such as F(0) = 0.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the function Z(x)**

The function Z(x) is defined as follows:

```
Z(x) = highest value of n such that 10^n divides x
```

A common mistake is to use the wrong base for the exponentiation. For example, using 2 instead of 10 will give incorrect results.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When computing Z(x), it is important to be careful about off-by-one errors. For example, if x = 1024, then Z(x) = 253, not 254.

**4. Floating-point errors**

When computing Z(x), it is important to be aware of floating-point errors. For example, if x is a very large number, then the value of Z(x) may be rounded to the nearest integer, which may not be the correct answer.

**5. Overflow errors**

When computing Z(x), it is important to be aware of overflow errors. For example, if x is a very large number, then the value of F(x) may overflow the integer type, which will lead to incorrect results.

**6. Time complexity**

The naive implementation of the function F(x) has a time complexity of O(x^2). This can be improved to O(x log x) using a divide-and-conquer algorithm.

**7. Space complexity**

The naive implementation of the function F(x) has a space complexity of O(x). This can be improved to O(log x) using a dynamic programming approach.

Title:
HACKEREARTH the-competitive-class-3

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not correctly specified. For example, if the input format is ```
n
a b c
```, then the program should read ```n``` as the number of students and ```a b c``` as the marks of the students. However, if the input format is ```
n a b c
```, then the program will read ```n``` as the first student's mark and ```a b c``` as the marks of the other students. This will lead to incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not correctly specified. For example, if the output format is ```
1 2 3 4
```, then the program should print ```1```, ```2```, ```3```, and ```4``` as the ranks of the students. However, if the output format is ```
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
```, then the program will print ```1```, ```2```, ```3```, and ```4``` as the ranks of the first four students, and ```5```, ```6```, ```7```, and ```8``` as the ranks of the last four students. This will lead to incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect data type**

The data type of the input and output values is not correctly specified. For example, if the input values are integers, but the output values are strings, then the program will not work correctly.

**4. Incorrect logic**

The logic of the program is not correct. For example, if the program is supposed to find the maximum element in an array, but it instead finds the minimum element, then the program will not work correctly.

**5. Incorrect implementation**

The implementation of the program is not correct. For example, if the program uses a for loop to iterate over an array, but it does not increment the loop variable correctly, then the program will not work correctly.
Test inputs:

Title:
ATCODER p02781 AtCoder Beginner Contest 154 - Almost Everywhere Zero

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input N can be very large, so it is important to use the correct data type to store it. If you use an integer type that is too small, you may get an overflow error.

**2. Not handling the case where K is greater than the number of digits in N**

If K is greater than the number of digits in N, then there are no integers between 1 and N that contain exactly K non-zero digits. In this case, you should return 0.

**3. Using an incorrect formula to calculate the number of integers**

The formula for calculating the number of integers between 1 and N that contain exactly K non-zero digits is:

```
C(N-1, K-1) * 10^K
```

where C(N-1, K-1) is the number of ways to choose K non-zero digits from the digits 1 through N-1.

**4. Not handling the case where N is negative**

The problem statement specifies that N must be positive, so you should check for this condition before performing any calculations. If N is negative, you should return 0.
Test inputs:
1. **Input that tests for the correct data type**

```
N = 10**100
K = 3
```

2. **Input that tests for the case where K is greater than the number of digits in N**

```
N = 10
K = 4
```

3. **Input that tests for the case where the formula for calculating the number of integers is incorrect**

```
N = 10
K = 2
```

4. **Input that tests for the case where N is negative**

```
N = -1
K = 1

Title:
ATCODER p02916 AtCoder Beginner Contest 140 - Buffet

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is specified as follows:

```
N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N
B_1 B_2 ... B_N
C_1 C_2 ... C_{N-1}
```

However, a developer may accidentally mistype the input format, such as:

```
N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N
B_1 B_2 ... B_N
C_1 C_2 ... C_N
```

This will cause the program to crash.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The data types of the input values are specified as follows:

* N: integer
* A_i: integer
* B_i: integer
* C_i: integer

However, a developer may accidentally mistype the data type of one or more of the input values, such as:

```
N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N
B_1 B_2 ... B_N
C_1 C_2 ... C_N
```

This will cause the program to crash.

**3. Incorrect calculation**

The sum of the satisfaction points Takahashi gained is calculated as follows:

```
sum = B_1 + B_2 + ... + B_N + C_1 + C_2 + ... + C_{N-1}
```

However, a developer may accidentally miscalculate the sum, such as:

```
sum = B_1 + B_2 + ... + B_N + C_1 + C_2 + ... + C_N
```

This will cause the program to output an incorrect answer.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output format is specified as follows:

```
sum
```

However, a developer may accidentally mistype the output format, such as:

```
print(sum)
```

This will cause the program to output the sum in a human-readable format, rather than the expected integer format.

Title:
ATCODER p03052 diverta 2019 Programming Contest - Edge Ordering

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not well-defined.** The input format does not specify the order of the edges, which could lead to ambiguity. For example, the input ```3 3
1 2
2 3
1 3``` could be interpreted as either ```(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3)``` or ```(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)```.

**2. The problem statement does not specify the exact definition of a minimum spanning tree.** A minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree of a graph whose total weight is minimized. However, the problem statement does not specify how to compute the weight of a spanning tree. This could lead to different implementations of the algorithm, which could produce different results.

**3. The problem statement does not specify the range of the edge weights.** The problem statement states that the edge weights are integers between 1 and M. However, it does not specify the value of M. This could lead to implementations that overflow the integer data type.

**4. The problem statement does not specify the output format.** The problem statement does not specify how the output should be formatted. This could lead to implementations that produce output in different formats, which could make it difficult to compare results.

**5. The problem statement does not specify the time complexity of the solution.** The problem statement does not specify how long the solution should take to run. This could lead to implementations that are inefficient and take a long time to run.

**6. The problem statement does not specify the memory complexity of the solution.** The problem statement does not specify how much memory the solution should use. This could lead to implementations that use a lot of memory and crash.

**7. The problem statement does not specify the correctness of the solution.** The problem statement does not specify how to verify that the solution is correct. This could lead to implementations that produce incorrect results.

**8. The problem statement does not specify the robustness of the solution.** The problem statement does not specify how the solution should handle invalid inputs. This could lead to implementations that crash or produce incorrect results when given invalid inputs.

Title:
ATCODER p03194 CADDi 2018 for Beginners - Product and GCD

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of mathematical operators.** For example, using `a % b` to calculate the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` is incorrect, as `a % b` will always be less than `b`. The correct way to calculate the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` is to use Euclid's algorithm.
2. **Incorrect use of data structures.** For example, using a `list` to store the factors of a number is incorrect, as a `list` is not a sorted data structure. The correct way to store the factors of a number is to use a `set`.
3. **Incorrect use of control flow statements.** For example, using a `while` loop to iterate over the factors of a number is incorrect, as a `while` loop will continue to iterate even if the condition is no longer true. The correct way to iterate over the factors of a number is to use a `for` loop.
4. **Incorrect use of functions.** For example, using a function to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers is incorrect, as the greatest common divisor of two numbers can be calculated using Euclid's algorithm. The correct way to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers is to use the `gcd()` function.
5. **Incorrect use of exceptions.** For example, catching an `Exception` when dividing by zero is incorrect, as division by zero should never occur. The correct way to handle division by zero is to use the `math.nan` value.
6. **Incorrect use of error handling.** For example, using `try` and `except` to handle errors is incorrect, as errors should always be handled gracefully. The correct way to handle errors is to use the `try` and `finally` statements.
7. **Incorrect use of comments.** For example, using comments to explain code that is already self-explanatory is incorrect. The correct way to use comments is to explain code that is not self-explanatory.
8. **Incorrect use of indentation.** For example, using inconsistent indentation is incorrect, as it can make code difficult to read. The correct way to use indentation is to use a consistent style.
9. **Incorrect use of whitespace.** For example, using excessive whitespace is incorrect, as it can make code difficult to read. The correct way to use whitespace is to use it sparingly.
10. **Incorrect use of capitalization.** For example, using inconsistent capitalization is incorrect, as it can make code difficult to read. The correct way to use capitalization is to use a consistent style.

Title:
ATCODER p03343 AtCoder Regular Contest 098 - Range Minimum Queries

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The most common bug is to implement the algorithm incorrectly. This can happen in a number of ways, such as:

* Using the wrong data structure to store the elements of the array.
* Using the wrong algorithm to find the smallest element in a subarray.
* Making a mistake in the logic of the algorithm.

**2. Incorrect input handling**

Another common bug is to handle the input incorrectly. This can happen in a number of ways, such as:

* Not reading the input correctly.
* Using the wrong type for the input values.
* Skipping over part of the input.

**3. Runtime errors**

A runtime error occurs when the program crashes or produces incorrect output due to a problem that is not caught by the compiler. This can happen in a number of ways, such as:

* Dividing by zero.
* Accessing an element of an array that is out of bounds.
* Using a pointer that is not initialized.

**4. Memory leaks**

A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing. Memory leaks can be caused by a number of things, such as:

* Forgetting to free memory that has been allocated.
* Using a memory pool that is not properly initialized or managed.
* Using a garbage collector that does not work correctly.

**5. Security vulnerabilities**

A security vulnerability is a weakness in a program that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system. Security vulnerabilities can be caused by a number of things, such as:

* Using insecure coding practices.
* Failing to implement security measures correctly.
* Using outdated or vulnerable software.

```

The correct output should be 1.

**Security vulnerabilities**

```
N, K, Q = map(int, input().split())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

for _ in range(Q):
    l, r = map(int, input().split())
    l -= 1
    r -= 1
    A[l], A[r] = A[r], A[l]

print(max(A) - min(A))
```

This code will produce the following security vulnerability:

```

Title:
ATCODER p03986 AtCoder Grand Contest 005 - STring

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of `S` and `T` characters.** The problem states that the string `X` has an even number of characters, and that half the characters are `S`, and the other half are `T`. A common mistake is to incorrectly count the number of `S` and `T` characters, resulting in an incorrect answer.
2. **Not handling the case where there are no occurrences of `ST` in the string `X`.** The problem states that Takahashi will perform the following operation 10^{10000} times:

* Among the occurrences of `ST` in X as (contiguous) substrings, remove the leftmost one. If there is no occurrence, do nothing.

If there are no occurrences of `ST` in the string `X`, then Takahashi will do nothing. A common mistake is to not handle this case, resulting in an incorrect answer.
3. **Not correctly implementing the algorithm for removing the leftmost occurrence of `ST` from the string `X`.** The algorithm for removing the leftmost occurrence of `ST` from the string `X` is as follows:

1. Find the leftmost occurrence of `ST` in the string `X`.
2. Remove the characters `S` and `T` from the string `X`.

A common mistake is to incorrectly implement this algorithm, resulting in an incorrect answer.
4. **Not correctly handling the case where the string `X` becomes empty after removing the leftmost occurrence of `ST`.** The problem states that the eventual length of `X` is the length of the string `X` after Takahashi has performed the operation 10^{10000} times. If the string `X` becomes empty after removing the leftmost occurrence of `ST`, then the eventual length of `X` is 0. A common mistake is to not correctly handle this case, resulting in an incorrect answer.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand all of the constraints.
* Make sure you correctly count the number of `S` and `T` characters in the string `X`.
* Handle the case where there are no occurrences of `ST` in the string `X`.
* Correctly implement the algorithm for removing the leftmost occurrence of `ST` from the string `X`.
* Handle the case where the string `X` becomes empty after removing the leftmost occurrence of `ST`.

Title:
AIZU p00365 Age Difference

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is given as strings, but the problem requires the data to be integers. The developer may incorrectly convert the strings to integers, resulting in incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum difference**. The maximum difference between two ages is the difference between the older person's age and the younger person's age. The developer may incorrectly calculate the difference, resulting in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect handling of leap years**. The problem states that the age increases by one at the moment the birthday begins. However, if the birthday coincides with the 29th of February in a leap year, the age increases at the moment the 1st of March arrives in non-leap years. The developer may incorrectly handle leap years, resulting in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The problem requires the output to be a single integer. The developer may incorrectly format the output, resulting in an incorrect answer.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input data type, correctly calculate the maximum difference, correctly handle leap years, and correctly format the output.

Title:
AIZU p00573 Commuter Pass

Pain points:
Possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrectly identifying the start and end stations of the commuter pass.** The commuter pass is only valid for travel between the start and end stations. If the developer incorrectly identifies the start and end stations, the output will be incorrect.
2. **Incorrectly identifying the railway lines that are included in the commuter pass.** The commuter pass only covers travel on railway lines that are included in the specified route. If the developer incorrectly identifies the railway lines that are included in the commuter pass, the output will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrectly calculating the fare for travel on each railway line.** The fare for travel on each railway line is calculated based on the distance between the start and end stations of the railway line. If the developer incorrectly calculates the fare for travel on each railway line, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Incorrectly summing the fares for travel on each railway line.** The total fare for travel from the start station to the end station is the sum of the fares for travel on each railway line. If the developer incorrectly sums the fares for travel on each railway line, the output will be incorrect.
5. **Incorrectly handling cases where the commuter pass is not used to travel from the start station to the end station.** If the commuter pass is not used to travel from the start station to the end station, the fare for travel from the start station to the end station will be the sum of the fares for travel on all railway lines. If the developer incorrectly handles cases where the commuter pass is not used to travel from the start station to the end station, the output will be incorrect.

To avoid these problems and bugs, the developer should carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements. The developer should also carefully design and implement their solution. The developer should also test their solution thoroughly to ensure that it is correct.

AIZU p01576 Exciting Bicycle

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined. For example, the input `4 10 0 0` is not valid, because the second number is not a space.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not strictly defined. For example, the output `22.223355980000002` is not valid, because it has too many digits after the decimal point.

**3. Incorrect calculation**

The bicycle's speed is not constant. It increases when the bicycle is going downhill and decreases when the bicycle is going uphill.

**4. Incorrect assumptions**

The distance between the falling point and any endpoint (except for the jumping point) is not necessarily not less than 10-5m.

**5. Incorrect implementation**

The code may not be correct. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
def calculate_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
  return math.sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2)

def main():
  n, v = map(int, input().split())
  points = []
  for _ in range(n):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    points.append((x, y))

  distance = 0
  for i in range(n - 1):
    x1, y1 = points[i]
    x2, y2 = points[i + 1]
    if y2 > y1:
      distance += calculate_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2)
    else:
      # This is incorrect. The bicycle's speed is not constant.
      distance += v * (y2 - y1) / 9.8

  print(distance)

Title:
AIZU p02014 Rough Sorting

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrectly counting the number of inversions.** In order to determine the minimum number of exchanges required to sort an array, it is necessary to count the number of inversions. An inversion occurs when a smaller element appears after a larger element in the array. For example, in the array `[3, 1, 2]`, there are two inversions: `(3, 1)` and `(3, 2)`.
2. **Not considering the lexicographical order.** When multiple possible solutions exist, the lexicographically minimum solution must be returned. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 3]`, both `[1, 2, 3]` and `[3, 1, 2]` are sorted, but the lexicographically minimum solution is `[1, 2, 3]`.
3. **Using an incorrect sorting algorithm.** The sorting algorithm used to sort the array must be able to handle the case where some of the elements are already in the correct order. For example, the quicksort algorithm will not work correctly if some of the elements are already in the correct order.
4. **Not handling the case where K is greater than the number of inversions.** In this case, the array is already sorted and no exchanges are necessary.
5. **Not handling the case where the array is empty.** In this case, the output should be an empty array.

**Additional tips:**

* When counting the number of inversions, it is helpful to use a merge sort algorithm. This algorithm will naturally count the number of inversions as it sorts the array.
* When determining the lexicographically minimum solution, it is helpful to sort the array by the first different element. This will ensure that the first different element in the output is the smallest possible.
* When using a sorting algorithm that does not handle the case where some of the elements are already in the correct order, it is helpful to first sort the array by the first different element. This will ensure that the sorting algorithm only needs to sort the remaining elements.
* When K is greater than the number of inversions, it is helpful to use a counting sort algorithm to sort the array. This algorithm will only need to sort the first K elements of the array.

Title:
AIZU p02157 Shuffle 2

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of this problem is "$ n $ $ q $ $ k $ $ d $", where "$ n $" is the number of cards, "$ q $" is the number of shuffles, "$ k $" is the number of the card that you want to be on the $ d $th position from the bottom, and "$ d $" is the position of the card that you want to be on the $ k $th position from the bottom. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to process the input correctly and will likely output incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect number of cards**

The number of cards in the input must be even. If the number of cards is odd, the program will not be able to process the input correctly and will likely output incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect number of shuffles**

The number of shuffles in the input must be a positive integer. If the number of shuffles is negative or zero, the program will not be able to process the input correctly and will likely output incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect values of $ k $ and $ d $**

The values of $ k $ and $ d $ must be between 1 and $ n $, inclusive. If the values of $ k $ and $ d $ are not between 1 and $ n $, the program will not be able to process the input correctly and will likely output incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect shuffle operations**

The shuffle operations must be either "0" or "1". If the shuffle operations are not "0" or "1", the program will not be able to process the input correctly and will likely output incorrect results.

**6. Incorrect output format**

The output of the program must be a sequence of shuffle operations, each on a separate line. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to output the correct results.

Title:
AIZU p02298 Is-Convex

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct.**

The input format is not correct if the number of points is not between 3 and 100, or if any of the coordinates are out of the range [-10000, 10000].

**2. The input points are not in counter-clockwise order.**

The input points must be in counter-clockwise order, otherwise the algorithm will not work correctly.

**3. The polygon is not convex.**

The polygon is not convex if any of the interior angles is greater than 180 degrees.

**4. The algorithm is not correct.**

The algorithm may be incorrect if it does not correctly check for all of the possible problems listed above.

Title:
AIZU p02445 Swap

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. Make sure to check the input format and handle invalid inputs gracefully.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. When swapping elements, it is easy to make off-by-one errors. Be careful when calculating the indices of the elements to be swapped.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic for swapping elements is not always straightforward. Make sure to understand the problem statement carefully and implement the logic correctly.
4. **Memory leaks**. When allocating memory for data structures, it is important to free the memory when you are finished with it. Make sure to check for memory leaks in your code.
5. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correct. Make sure to format your output correctly.
