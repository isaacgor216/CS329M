Title:
CODECHEF pcsc2

Pain points:
### Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrectly calculating the Fibonacci sequence.** The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers. For example, the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34. A common mistake is to calculate the Fibonacci sequence incorrectly by adding the current number to the number two places back instead of the number one place back. This will result in a different sequence of numbers that is not the Fibonacci sequence.
2. **Using an incorrect data type to store the Fibonacci numbers.** The Fibonacci numbers can grow very large very quickly. For example, the 100th Fibonacci number is 354,224,848,179,261,915. If an integer data type is used to store the Fibonacci numbers, it is possible that the numbers will overflow and cause the program to crash. To avoid this, it is important to use a data type that is large enough to store the Fibonacci numbers.
3. **Using an infinite loop.** The Fibonacci sequence is an infinite sequence of numbers. If a developer does not take care to terminate the loop that is used to calculate the Fibonacci numbers, the program will run forever. This can waste CPU resources and cause the program to become unresponsive.
4. **Not handling invalid input correctly.** The input to the program may be invalid. For example, the user may enter a negative number for the first or second Fibonacci number. The program should handle invalid input gracefully and provide the user with an appropriate error message.
5. **Not using appropriate error handling.** The program may encounter errors during execution. For example, the program may run out of memory or the user may interrupt the program. The program should use appropriate error handling to catch and handle these errors gracefully.

Title:
CODECHEF start01

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input type**. The user may enter a string instead of a number, which will cause an error.
2. **Malformed input**. The user may enter a number with a leading or trailing space, which will also cause an error.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The program should output the number in the same format as it was entered by the user. For example, if the user enters a number with a decimal point, the program should output the number with the same number of decimal places.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The program may output the wrong number if the user enters a number that is close to a boundary value. For example, if the user enters a number that is just below the maximum value that the program can handle, the program may output the maximum value instead.
5. **Buffer overflows**. The program may crash if the user enters a number that is too large for the program to handle.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1053_D. Linear Congruential Generator

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**

The modulo operator (%) in Python returns the remainder of a division. This means that if you divide 10 by 3, you will get 1 as the remainder. However, if you divide 11 by 3, you will get 2 as the remainder. This can be a problem when you are trying to calculate the maximum number of different tuples, because you need to make sure that you are not counting the same tuple twice.

To avoid this problem, you can use the following code:

```python
def mod(x, y):
    # Return the remainder of x divided by y
    return x - y * (x // y)
```

This function will always return the correct remainder, regardless of the sign of x or y.

**2. Not using the Chinese remainder theorem**

The Chinese remainder theorem is a powerful tool that can be used to solve problems involving multiple moduli. In this problem, we can use the Chinese remainder theorem to find the maximum number of different tuples that can be generated by the linear congruential generator.

To use the Chinese remainder theorem, we first need to find the least common multiple of all of the moduli. This can be done using the following code:

```python
def lcm(a, b):
    # Return the least common multiple of a and b
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)
```

Once we have the least common multiple, we can use the Chinese remainder theorem to find the number of different tuples that can be generated. This can be done using the following code:

```python
def chinese_remainder(a, m):
    # Return the number of different tuples that can be generated by the linear congruential generator
    n = len(a)
    M = lcm(*m)
    x = 0
    for i in range(n):
        x += a[i] * M // m[i]
    return x % M
```

**3. Not handling overflows correctly**

When working with large numbers, it is important to be aware of the possibility of overflows. An overflow occurs when a number is too large to be represented by the data type that is being used. This can cause errors in your code, such as incorrect results or crashes.

To avoid overflows, you can use the following techniques:

* Use the `long` data type instead of the `int` data type for numbers that are larger than 2 ** 31 - 1.
* Use the `math.pow()` function to calculate powers of numbers.
* Use the `math.ceil()` function to round numbers up to the nearest integer.

**4. Not using efficient algorithms**

The algorithms that you use to solve a problem can have a significant impact on the performance of your code. When solving this problem, you can use the following efficient algorithms:

* Use the `bisect` module to find the index of an element in a sorted list.
* Use the `collections.defaultdict` class to create a dictionary that automatically creates new keys when they are not found.
* Use the `itertools.combinations` function to generate all possible combinations of a set of elements.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code to make sure that it is working correctly. This can be done by creating a set of test cases and running your code on them. If your code does not pass all of the test cases, then you need to fix it.

Here are some tips for writing good test cases:

* Make sure that your test cases cover all of the different possible scenarios.
* Make sure that your test cases are independent of each other.
* Make sure that your test cases are clear and concise.

By following these tips, you can help to ensure that your code is working correctly and that it is free of bugs.

CODEFORCES 1075_E. Optimal Polygon Perimeter

Pain points:
### Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of perimeter:** The perimeter of a polygon is calculated incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect handling of self-intersecting polygons:** Self-intersecting polygons are not handled correctly, which can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correctly formatted, which can make it difficult to read and understand the results.
5. **Other bugs:** There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem, such as memory leaks, race conditions, and deadlocks.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement, and to test your code thoroughly. It is also helpful to use a debugger to track down any errors that may occur.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1096_F. Inversion Expectation

Pain points:
**Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs:**

1. **Incorrect calculation of the number of inversions.** This is the most common mistake that people make when solving this problem. The number of inversions is not simply the number of pairs of elements $(i, j)$ such that $i > j$ and $a_i < a_j$. Instead, we need to take into account the fact that the elements in the permutation are not necessarily distinct. For example, if the permutation is $[1, 1, 2]$, then there are two inversions: $(1, 2)$ and $(2, 1)$.
2. **Incorrect handling of the case where there are no -1s in the input.** In this case, the only valid permutation is the one that is given in the input. Therefore, the expected number of inversions is 0.
3. **Incorrect handling of the case where there are multiple valid permutations.** In this case, we need to take into account the fact that each valid permutation is equally likely to be generated. We can do this by multiplying the number of inversions in each valid permutation by the probability of that permutation being generated.
4. **Incorrect modular arithmetic.** When calculating the expected number of inversions, we need to take into account the fact that the answer is a non-negative integer modulo $998244353$. This means that we need to perform all of our calculations modulo $998244353$.

**Additional Tips:**

1. One way to avoid the mistake of incorrectly calculating the number of inversions is to use a disjoint set data structure. This data structure allows us to track the number of inversions between each pair of elements in the permutation.
2. Another way to avoid the mistake of incorrectly handling the case where there are no -1s in the input is to use a greedy algorithm. This algorithm will find the valid permutation with the fewest number of inversions.
3. One way to avoid the mistake of incorrectly handling the case where there are multiple valid permutations is to use a dynamic programming algorithm. This algorithm will build up a table of the expected number of inversions for each possible permutation.
4. One way to avoid the mistake of incorrect modular arithmetic is to use the `pow()` function in Python. This function takes two arguments: the base and the exponent. The exponent can be negative, which allows us to perform modular exponentiation.

CODEFORCES 1117_G. Recursive Queries

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the recursive function.** The recursive function should take into account the base case, i.e., the case when `l == r`. In this case, the function should return `(r - l + 1)`.
2. **Incorrect use of the memoization table.** The memoization table should be initialized to all `-1` values. This is necessary to ensure that the function returns the correct value even if it is called with the same arguments multiple times.
3. **Incorrect handling of out-of-bounds queries.** The function should check if `l <= r` and return `0` if this condition is not satisfied.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum in a subsegment.** The maximum in a subsegment can be found using a simple linear scan.
5. **Incorrect calculation of the sum of the function values over a subsegment.** The sum of the function values over a subsegment can be calculated using the following formula:

```
f(l, r) = (r - l + 1) + f(l, m_{l,r} - 1) + f(m_{l,r} + 1, r)
```

where `m_{l,r}` is the position of the maximum in the subsegment `p_l, p_{l+1}, ..., p_r`.

2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values may not be correctly specified, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input values are strings, the program may try to perform mathematical operations on them, which will result in errors.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, which can lead to errors in the output. For example, the program may not correctly identify the increasing and decreasing sequences, or it may output the wrong sequences.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. The program may be incorrectly implemented, which can lead to errors in the output. For example, the program may not use the correct data structures or algorithms, or it may not handle errors correctly.
5. **Incorrect testing**. The program may not be tested correctly, which can lead to errors in the output. For example, the program may not be tested with all possible input values, or it may not be tested with invalid input values.

CODEFORCES 1165_B. Polycarp Training

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n, and the second line should contain n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. However, if the input format is not followed, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n, and the second line should contain n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. However, if the input data is not of the correct type (e.g., if n is not an integer or if a_i is not an integer), the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over the input data, it is important to make sure that the indices are correct. For example, if the input data contains n integers, the program should iterate from 0 to n-1. If the indices are incorrect, the program may skip or repeat elements of the input data, which will lead to incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program should be correct in order to produce the correct output. For example, the program should correctly determine the maximum number of days that Polycarp can train. If the logic is incorrect, the program may produce incorrect output.
5. **Memory leaks.** The program should not leak memory. If the program leaks memory, it may eventually crash or run out of memory.
6. **Race conditions.** If the program is multi-threaded, it is important to avoid race conditions. A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. If a race condition occurs, the program may produce incorrect output or crash.
7. **Deadlocks.** If the program is multi-threaded, it is important to avoid deadlocks. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. If a deadlock occurs, the program will be unable to continue execution.
8. **Buffer overflows.** The program should not overflow any buffers. If a buffer overflow occurs, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
9. **Format errors.** The output format should be correct. For example, the output should contain a single integer, which is the maximum number of days that Polycarp can train. If the output format is incorrect, the program may not be accepted by the judge.

CODEFORCES 1184_C1. Heidi and the Turing Test (Easy)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain an integer n, followed by 4n+1 lines each containing two integers x and y. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to process the input and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the program should print two integers, x and y, separated by a space. If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will likely receive a incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm used to solve the problem must be correct in order to produce the correct output. There are a number of possible ways to solve this problem, but not all of them are correct. For example, an incorrect algorithm might try to find the point that is farthest from the origin, or the point that is closest to the origin. These algorithms would not be able to correctly identify the point that is not on the boundary of the square.
4. **Insufficient memory.** The program must be able to store all of the input data in memory in order to process it. If the program does not have enough memory, it will not be able to complete the computation and will likely crash.
5. **Timeout.** The program must be able to complete the computation within a specified time limit. If the program does not finish within the time limit, it will be considered incorrect.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to choose an appropriate algorithm and to make sure that the program has enough memory to store all of the input data. Finally, it is important to test the program thoroughly to make sure that it produces the correct output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1285_D. Dr. Evil Underscores

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of bitwise operators.** The bitwise XOR operator (`^`) is often used incorrectly, resulting in incorrect results. For example, the following code will not produce the expected output:

```
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
print(max(a ^ b))
```

The output of this code will be `7`, which is not the maximum possible value of `a ^ b`. The correct way to find the maximum possible value of `a ^ b` is to use the following code:

```
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
print(max(a) ^ max(b))
```

2. **Incorrect use of loops.** The most common mistake when using loops is to forget to initialize the loop variable. For example, the following code will not produce the expected output:

```
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

The output of this code will be `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, and `9`. The correct way to write this code is to initialize the loop variable to `0` before the loop starts:

```
for i in range(10):
    i = 0
    print(i)
```

3. **Incorrect use of conditional statements.** The most common mistake when using conditional statements is to forget to check for the `else` clause. For example, the following code will not produce the expected output:

```
if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
```

The output of this code will be `x is less than y` even if `x` is greater than `y`. The correct way to write this code is to add an `else` clause:

```
if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
else:
    print("x is greater than y")
```

4. **Incorrect use of functions.** The most common mistake when using functions is to forget to return a value. For example, the following function will not produce the expected output:

```
def get_max(a, b):
    if a > b:
        return a
```

The output of this function will be `None`. The correct way to write this function is to return the maximum value of `a` and `b`:

```
def get_max(a, b):
    if a > b:
        return a
    else:
        return b
```

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer, the maximum number of animals that can be observed.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm may not find the optimal solution. For example, the algorithm may not consider all possible ways to place the cameras.
4. **Memory limit exceeded**. The algorithm may use too much memory. For example, the algorithm may create a large array to store the data.
5. **Time limit exceeded**. The algorithm may take too long to run. For example, the algorithm may iterate over all possible solutions to the problem.
6. **Incorrect data**. The input data may be incorrect. For example, the input data may contain negative numbers or numbers that are too large.
7. **Other bugs**. There may be other bugs in the code that are not listed here.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the algorithm thoroughly with a variety of input data.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1480_A. Yet Another String Game

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input string is a string of lowercase English letters. However, if you accidentally use an integer data type to store the string, you will get a runtime error.

**2. Not handling the edge cases**

The input string may be empty. In this case, the final string should be an empty string.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The logic for finding the final string is not correct. For example, you may mistakenly think that the final string is the lexicographically largest string that can be formed by changing the input string.

**4. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

There is a more efficient algorithm for finding the final string. You can use this algorithm to improve the performance of your code.

**5. Not handling errors correctly**

Your code should handle errors correctly. For example, if the input string is invalid, your code should print an error message and exit.

CODEFORCES 1506_G. Maximize the Remaining String

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input string may contain characters that are not lowercase Latin letters. If you use the wrong data type to store the string, you may encounter a `ValueError` exception.

**2. Mismatched for loop conditions**

The problem states that you should perform the following operation while there is at least one character in the string s that is repeated at least twice. However, if you forget to check the condition `s != ""`, you may end up looping forever.

**3. Incorrect use of the `max()` function**

The problem states that you should find the lexicographically maximum string that can be obtained after applying a certain sequence of operations. However, if you incorrectly use the `max()` function, you may end up finding the string that is lexicographically smallest instead.

**4. Forgetting to handle edge cases**

The problem states that the sum of the lengths of the strings in all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. However, if you forget to handle this edge case, you may encounter a `MemoryError` exception.

**5. Using inefficient algorithms**

The problem can be solved in O(n) time, where n is the length of the input string. However, if you use an inefficient algorithm, you may end up with a time complexity that is much higher.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1534_A. Colour the Flag

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly identifying the red and white cells.** The first step in solving this problem is to identify which cells are red and which are white. This can be done by scanning the grid and looking for cells that are marked with the letter "R" or "W". However, it is important to be careful not to mistake a blank cell for a white cell, or a red cell for a blank cell.
2. **Not considering all of the possible solutions.** There may be more than one way to color the blank cells so that every red cell has white neighbors and every white cell has red neighbors. It is important to consider all of the possible solutions and choose the one that is most efficient.
3. **Making a mistake in the output.** The output of the program should be a grid that is identical to the input grid, except that the blank cells have been colored red or white. It is important to make sure that the output is correct, and that no mistakes have been made.
4. **Not handling corner cases correctly.** The problem statement specifies that the blank cells should not share a corner with a red or white cell. It is important to handle this case correctly, and to make sure that no blank cells are incorrectly colored.
5. **Using inefficient algorithms.** The problem can be solved using a brute-force algorithm, but this will be very inefficient for large grids. It is better to use a more efficient algorithm, such as a greedy algorithm or a dynamic programming algorithm.

CODEFORCES 180_E. Cubes

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program's logic. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format must be exactly as specified in the problem statement. For example, if the output contains a decimal point when it should be an integer, the program will not be accepted.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program's logic must be correct in order to produce the correct output. For example, if the program does not take into account all of the constraints in the problem statement, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the program's logic is correct, but the output is incorrect because of a small mistake in the code. For example, if the program counts the number of cubes in a row incorrectly, the output will be incorrect.
5. **Memory errors**. Memory errors can occur when the program allocates too much or too little memory. For example, if the program allocates too much memory, it may crash. If the program allocates too little memory, it may not be able to store all of the data it needs, which can lead to errors.
6. **Time errors**. Time errors occur when the program takes too long to run. For example, if the program is not optimized properly, it may take a long time to run even for small inputs.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can occur when the program is not written securely. For example, if the program allows users to input arbitrary code, it may be possible for attackers to exploit the program to gain unauthorized access to the system.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid common problems and bugs when solving programming problems.

CODEFORCES 204_A. Little Elephant and Interval

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specified in the problem statement is "The single line contains a pair of integers l and r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 1018) — the boundaries of the interval.". However, a developer may accidentally use a different input format, such as "The single line contains a pair of integers l and r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 1018) — the boundaries of the interval.". This will result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specified in the problem statement is "On a single line print a single integer — the answer to the problem.". However, a developer may accidentally print multiple lines of output, or print a non-integer value. This will result in a incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the answer.** The Little Elephant wants to find the number of integers in the interval `[l, r]` such that the first digit of the integer is equal to the last digit. A developer may accidentally calculate the number of integers in the interval `[l, r]` such that the first digit of the integer is less than or equal to the last digit. This will result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect use of the `%lld` specifier.** The problem statement states that "Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.". However, a developer may accidentally use the `%lld` specifier to read or write 64-bit integers. This will result in a compiler error.
5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:
    * Using the wrong data type to store the input values.
    * Using the wrong algorithm to calculate the answer.
    * Making a mistake in the logic of the code.
    * Not handling errors correctly.

By following the tips in this article, you can help to avoid these common problems and bugs when solving coding problems.

CODEFORCES 228_E. The Road to Berland is Paved With Good Intentions

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that the input is in the correct format. For example, if the input contains a line with more than three space-separated integers, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is also very specific. It is important to make sure that the output is in the correct format. For example, if the output does not contain two lines, or if the second line does not contain the correct number of integers, the program will not be accepted.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve the problem must be correct. If the algorithm is incorrect, the program will not be able to find the correct answer. For example, if the algorithm does not take into account all of the constraints of the problem, the program will not be able to find the correct answer.

**4. Runtime error**

The program must be able to run within the specified time limit. If the program takes too long to run, it will not be accepted. For example, if the program uses a recursive algorithm that takes a long time to run, the program will not be accepted.

**5. Memory error**

The program must be able to run within the specified memory limit. If the program uses too much memory, it will not be accepted. For example, if the program uses a data structure that takes up a lot of memory, the program will not be accepted.

**6. Incorrect solution**

The program must find the correct answer to the problem. If the program does not find the correct answer, it will not be accepted. For example, if the program returns an answer that is not feasible, the program will not be accepted.

Title:
CODEFORCES 252_C. Points on Line

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specified in the problem statement is very specific. Make sure to read it carefully and parse the input data correctly.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. When computing the distance between two points, it is easy to make a mistake and add or subtract one too many or too few. Be careful to check your work carefully.
3. **Incorrect use of the %lld specifier**. The %lld specifier is used to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. However, it is not supported by all compilers. If you are using a compiler that does not support the %lld specifier, you can use the cin and cout streams or the %I64d specifier instead.
4. **Incorrect use of the STL containers**. The STL containers are a powerful tool, but they can be easy to misuse. Make sure you understand how the containers work before using them in your code.
5. **Incorrect use of the STL algorithms**. The STL algorithms can be very efficient, but they can also be easy to misuse. Make sure you understand how the algorithms work before using them in your code.
6. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks can occur when you allocate memory but do not free it when you are finished with it. This can lead to your program running out of memory and crashing. Make sure to free all of the memory that you allocate in your code.
7. **Synchronization errors**. When multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is important to ensure that the data is accessed in a consistent manner. This can be done using synchronization mechanisms such as locks and mutexes. Make sure to use synchronization mechanisms correctly to avoid data corruption and race conditions.
8. **Exception handling errors**. When your code throws an exception, it is important to handle the exception correctly. This may involve logging the exception, printing an error message, or terminating the program. Make sure you handle exceptions correctly to avoid your program crashing.
9. **Security vulnerabilities**. When writing secure code, it is important to be aware of potential security vulnerabilities. This may involve using secure coding practices such as input validation, escaping output, and using cryptography correctly. Make sure you write secure code to protect your users from attack.
10. **Performance bottlenecks**. When writing efficient code, it is important to identify and eliminate performance bottlenecks. This may involve using more efficient algorithms, caching data, and parallelizing your code. Make sure you write efficient code to improve the performance of your program.

Title:
CODEFORCES 277_D. Google Code Jam

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not strictly followed, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a problem with a negative score, the program will crash.
* **Incorrect data type:** The input data may be of the wrong type, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a problem with a time limit that is not a number, the program will crash.
* **Off-by-one errors:** The program may incorrectly calculate the time or score of a problem, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program incorrectly calculates the time it takes to solve a problem, the program may submit the solution too early or too late, which can affect the score.
* **Memory leaks:** The program may not release memory that it is no longer using, which can lead to a memory leak. This can eventually cause the program to crash.
* **Race conditions:** The program may not be thread-safe, which can lead to incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.
* **Deadlocks:** The program may deadlock if multiple threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can prevent the program from making progress and can eventually cause it to crash.
* **Uncaught exceptions:** The program may not handle exceptions correctly, which can lead to incorrect results or a crash. For example, if the program encounters an invalid input, it should gracefully handle the exception and continue running.

**How to avoid these problems:**

* **Use the correct input format:** The input format should be strictly followed to avoid errors. For example, all numbers should be in the correct format, and there should be no spaces between the numbers.
* **Use the correct data type:** The input data should be of the correct type to avoid errors. For example, all numbers should be of type `int` or `float`, and all strings should be of type `str`.
* **Check for off-by-one errors:** The program should check for off-by-one errors to avoid incorrect results. For example, the program should check that the time limit for a problem is not less than zero.
* **Prevent memory leaks:** The program should release memory that it is no longer using to avoid memory leaks. This can be done by using the `del` keyword or by calling the `clear()` method on a collection.
* **Avoid race conditions:** The program should be thread-safe to avoid race conditions. This can be done by using locks to protect shared data.
* **Prevent deadlocks:** The program should avoid deadlocks by using locks in a consistent order. For example, the program should always acquire the lock for `A` before acquiring the lock for `B`.
* **Handle exceptions gracefully:** The program should handle exceptions gracefully to avoid incorrect results or a crash. For example, the program should print an error message and continue running if it encounters an invalid input.

CODEFORCES 2_A. Winner

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of rounds is not an integer, or if the name of a player is not a string of lowercase Latin letters, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed, which may lead to the program not being accepted by the judge. For example, if the name of the winner is not a string of lowercase Latin letters, the program may not be accepted.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, which may lead to the wrong winner being declared. For example, if the program does not take into account the fact that two or more players may have the same maximum number of points, the wrong winner may be declared.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program may not properly free up memory that it has allocated, which may lead to a memory leak. This can cause the program to crash or run slowly.
5. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may contain security vulnerabilities, which may allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or to the system on which it is running. For example, if the program allows users to input arbitrary data, attackers may be able to inject malicious code into the program.

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not specified clearly. For example, it is not clear whether the number of apples in each leaf vertex should be written in a single line or multiple lines.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The number of apples in each leaf vertex can be very large. It is important to use the correct data type to store the number of apples.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may not be correct. For example, the algorithm may not always find the minimum number of apples to remove in order to make the tree balanced.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. The implementation of the algorithm may contain bugs. For example, the algorithm may not correctly handle all possible cases.
5. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not specified clearly. For example, it is not clear whether the minimum number of apples to remove should be written in a single line or multiple lines.
Test inputs:
### Incorrect input format

This input is incorrect because it does not specify the number of vertices in the tree.

### Incorrect data type

```
3
0 0 12 13 5 6
1 2
1 3

Title:
CODEFORCES 371_C. Hamburgers

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is specified in the problem statement. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The problem statement specifies that the input and output should be integers. If the input or output is not in the correct data type, the program will not be able to correctly process the data and will produce incorrect output.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a programmer accidentally counts one more or one less than they intended. This can happen when iterating over a list, adding or subtracting numbers, or comparing two values. Off-by-one errors can be difficult to find, as they often do not cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**4. Logic errors**

Logic errors occur when the programmer makes a mistake in the logic of the program. This can happen when the programmer misunderstands the problem, or when they make a mistake in their implementation. Logic errors can be difficult to find, as they often do not cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**5. Undefined behavior**

Undefined behavior occurs when the compiler is not able to determine the outcome of a certain operation. This can happen when the programmer uses an undefined function, or when they use a function in a way that is not defined. Undefined behavior can cause the program to crash, or to produce incorrect output.

**6. Memory errors**

Memory errors occur when the programmer allocates or frees memory incorrectly. This can happen when the programmer does not free memory that is no longer needed, or when they allocate memory that they do not have permission to access. Memory errors can cause the program to crash, or to produce incorrect output.

**7. Race conditions**

Race conditions occur when two or more threads of execution try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output, or to crash. Race conditions can be difficult to find, as they often do not occur consistently.

**8. Deadlocks**

Deadlocks occur when two or more threads of execution are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely. Deadlocks can be difficult to find, as they often do not occur consistently.

**9. Security vulnerabilities**

Security vulnerabilities occur when the programmer makes a mistake that allows an attacker to exploit the program. This can happen when the programmer uses insecure coding practices, or when they implement a security feature incorrectly. Security vulnerabilities can allow attackers to access sensitive data, or to take control of the system.

**10. Performance issues**

Performance issues can occur when the programmer implements the program inefficiently. This can happen when the programmer uses inefficient algorithms, or when they use data structures that are not suited for the task at hand. Performance issues can cause the program to run slowly, or to use more memory than necessary.

CODEFORCES 392_E. Deleting Substrings

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the logic.** The developer may incorrectly implement the logic of the problem, which will lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may not correctly check the conditions for deleting a substring, or may not correctly calculate the score.
2. **Incorrect input/output handling.** The developer may incorrectly handle the input or output of the problem, which will lead to errors. For example, the developer may not correctly parse the input data, or may not correctly format the output data.
3. **Memory leaks.** The developer may not correctly free memory that is allocated during the execution of the program, which will lead to memory leaks. This can eventually cause the program to crash or run out of memory.
4. **Race conditions.** The developer may not correctly synchronize access to shared data between multiple threads, which can lead to race conditions. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
5. **Deadlocks.** The developer may not correctly handle deadlocks, which can cause the program to hang or crash.
6. **Security vulnerabilities.** The developer may introduce security vulnerabilities into the program, which can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or data.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully review their code and test it thoroughly before deploying it to production. They should also use a debugger to help identify and fix bugs.

CODEFORCES 416_A. Guess a number!

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a space between the sign and the number, the program may not be able to parse it correctly.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input may not be what the program expects, which can also lead to errors. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program may not be able to process it correctly.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program does not check for all possible cases, it may not be able to find the correct answer.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the program may not be correct, which can make it difficult to understand the results. For example, if the program prints the results in a different format than what is expected, it may be difficult to interpret the results.
5. **Other bugs**. There are many other possible bugs that can occur in a program, such as memory leaks, race conditions, and deadlocks. These bugs can all lead to incorrect results or crashes.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully test the program with a variety of input data. It is also important to use a debugger to find and fix any errors that are found.

CODEFORCES 512_C. Fox And Dinner

Pain points:
**1. Input Format**

The first line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 200): the number of foxes in this party.

The second line contains n integers ai (2 ≤ ai ≤ 104).

**2. Output Format**

If it is impossible to do this, output "Impossible".

Otherwise, in the first line output an integer m (<image>): the number of tables.

Then output m lines, each line should start with an integer k -=– the number of foxes around that table, and then k numbers — indices of fox sitting around that table in clockwise order.

If there are several possible arrangements, output any of them.

Title:
CODEFORCES 536_D. Tavas in Kansas

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is a string, but the code is expecting an integer. This can be fixed by using the `int()` function to convert the string to an integer.
2. **Incorrect variable name**. The variable `s` is used to store the value of `n`, which is the number of cities. This can be fixed by changing the name of the variable to something more appropriate, such as `num_cities`.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code is checking if `p[s] > p[t]`, but this is not the correct way to determine who wins the game. The correct way is to check if `Tavas_score > Nafas_score`.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The code is checking if `dist[s][t] <= x`, but this should be `dist[s][t] < x`.
5. **Infinite loop**. The code is using a while loop to iterate over the values of `x`, but it is not checking if `x` is greater than `dist[s][t]`. This can cause the loop to run indefinitely.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to use the correct data types and variable names. Finally, it is important to check your code carefully for errors before submitting it.

Title:
CODEFORCES 560_E. Gerald and Giant Chess

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly and that you are not missing any of the required information. For example, if you forget to read the number of black cells, your program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer. Make sure that you are not printing any extra information, such as a newline character or a space.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When counting the number of ways to move the pawn, it is easy to make a mistake and count one way too many or one way too few. Be careful to check your work carefully and make sure that you are not making any off-by-one errors.

**4. Incorrect modular arithmetic**

When computing the final answer, it is important to remember to perform modular arithmetic. This means that you need to take the remainder of the answer when divided by 109 + 7. If you forget to do this, your answer will be incorrect.

**5. Runtime errors**

This problem can be solved in O(n) time, so it is important to make sure that your program is not running in O(n^2) time or worse. One common way to make a runtime error is to iterate over the list of black cells multiple times. Make sure that you are only iterating over the list once.

**6. Memory errors**

This problem does not require a lot of memory, so it is unlikely that you will run into a memory error. However, it is still possible to make a memory error if you are not careful. For example, if you allocate an array that is too large, your program will run out of memory. Make sure that you are only allocating the amount of memory that you need.

Title:
CODEFORCES 724_G. Xor-matic Number of the Graph

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the xor operation.** The xor operation is a binary operation that returns the value of one of the operands if they are equal, and the opposite value otherwise. In Python, the xor operation is implemented using the `^` operator. However, it is important to note that the `^` operator also has a bitwise meaning, which means that it will only return the xor of the bits of the two operands. This can lead to incorrect results if the operands are not of the same type. For example, if one of the operands is a string, the `^` operator will return the xor of the characters in the string, which is not what is desired.
2. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator is a mathematical operator that returns the remainder of a division operation. In Python, the modulo operator is implemented using the `%` operator. It is important to note that the modulo operator only works on integers, and will raise an error if either operand is not an integer.
3. **Incorrect use of the range function.** The range function is a built-in function in Python that returns a sequence of numbers from a starting value to an ending value. However, it is important to note that the ending value is not included in the sequence. This can lead to incorrect results if the ending value is not explicitly checked.
4. **Incorrect use of the list comprehension.** A list comprehension is a concise way to create a list from a sequence of values. However, it is important to note that the list comprehension will only be evaluated once, even if the sequence of values is changed. This can lead to incorrect results if the sequence of values is changed after the list comprehension has been created.
5. **Incorrect use of the map function.** The map function is a built-in function in Python that applies a function to each element of a sequence. However, it is important to note that the map function will only apply the function to the first element of the sequence if the sequence is empty. This can lead to incorrect results if the sequence is empty.
6. **Incorrect use of the filter function.** The filter function is a built-in function in Python that returns a sequence of elements from a sequence that meet a certain criteria. However, it is important to note that the filter function will only return the first element of the sequence that meets the criteria if the sequence is empty. This can lead to incorrect results if the sequence is empty.
7. **Incorrect use of the reduce function.** The reduce function is a built-in function in Python that applies a function to a sequence of values, reducing them to a single value. However, it is important to note that the reduce function will only be applied to the first two elements of the sequence if the sequence is empty. This can lead to incorrect results if the sequence is empty.
8. **Incorrect use of the enumerate function.** The enumerate function is a built-in function in Python that returns a tuple of the index and value of each element in a sequence. However, it is important to note that the enumerate function will only return the first element of the sequence if the sequence is empty. This can lead to incorrect results if the sequence is empty.
9. **Incorrect use of the zip function.** The zip function is a built-in function in Python that combines two sequences into a single sequence of tuples. However, it is important to note that the zip function will only return the first element of each sequence if one of the sequences is empty. This can lead to incorrect results if one of the sequences is empty.
10. **Incorrect use of the all function.** The all function is a built-in function in Python that returns True if all of the elements in a sequence are True. However, it is important to note that the all function will return True if the sequence is empty. This can lead to incorrect results if the sequence is empty.
11. **Incorrect use of the any function.** The any function is a built-in function in Python that returns True if any of the elements in a sequence are True. However, it is important to note that the any function will return False if the sequence is empty. This can lead to incorrect results if the sequence is empty.

Title:
CODEFORCES 746_G. New Roads

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a negative number, a number that is too large, or a string instead of a number.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may contain a number that is not an integer, a string instead of a number, or two numbers that are not separated by a space.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The solution may not be correct. For example, the solution may not satisfy all of the constraints in the problem statement.
4. **Memory limit exceeded**. The solution may use too much memory. This can happen if the solution is not efficient enough or if it uses too much data.
5. **Time limit exceeded**. The solution may not finish running within the time limit. This can happen if the solution is not efficient enough or if it uses too much data.

Title:
CODEFORCES 76_C. Mutation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is given as a string, but the problem statement requires it to be an integer. This can be fixed by using the `int()` function to cast the string to an integer.
2. **Incorrect index**. The problem statement specifies that the index of the first gene is 1, but the code uses 0. This can be fixed by changing the index of the first gene to 1.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The code iterates over the array of genes one element past the end of the array, which results in an incorrect answer. This can be fixed by checking the length of the array before iterating over it.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The code does not correctly account for the fact that the risk of disease occurence can be increased by removing genes. This can be fixed by adding the additional risk of disease occurence to the total risk of disease occurence.
5. **Memory leak**. The code does not free the memory that is allocated for the array of genes, which can lead to a memory leak. This can be fixed by calling the `free()` function on the array of genes when it is no longer needed.

Title:
CODEFORCES 793_G. Oleg and chess

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement is quite long and detailed, so it is important to read it carefully and make sure that you understand all of the requirements. For example, it is important to understand that the deleted cells are not removed from the board, but they still count as cells that cannot be occupied by rooks.
* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for solving this problem is not particularly difficult, but it is important to make sure that you implement it correctly. For example, you need to make sure that you correctly handle the case where two or more deleted rectangles overlap.
* **Incorrect testing.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. For example, you should test your solution on a variety of input values, including both small and large values. You should also test your solution on input values that are intentionally designed to be difficult.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **A bug where the developer incorrectly counts the number of deleted cells.** This could happen if the developer does not correctly account for the fact that the deleted cells are not removed from the board. For example, the developer might mistakenly think that the number of deleted cells is equal to the number of rectangles that are deleted.
* **A bug where the developer incorrectly handles the case where two or more deleted rectangles overlap.** This could happen if the developer does not correctly update the set of cells that are available to be occupied by rooks. For example, the developer might mistakenly think that a cell is available to be occupied by a rook even if it is located inside of a deleted rectangle.
* **A bug where the developer does not correctly test their solution.** This could happen if the developer does not test their solution on a variety of input values, including both small and large values. For example, the developer might mistakenly think that their solution is correct even though it fails on some input values.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

CODEFORCES 814_D. An overnight dance in discotheque

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correct. For example, the input may contain a non-integer number, or the number of dancers may be negative.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correct. For example, the output may contain a non-decimal number, or the output may not be rounded to 10 digits after the decimal point.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The solution may not calculate the correct answer. For example, the solution may not consider all possible combinations of dancers who move in the first half and the second half.
4. **Time limit exceeded**. The solution may run for too long. For example, the solution may use a recursive algorithm that does not terminate.
5. **Memory limit exceeded**. The solution may use too much memory. For example, the solution may create a large array to store the dancers' movement ranges.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully check your input format, output format, calculation, and time and memory usage. You can also use a debugger to help you find and fix bugs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 83_D. Numbers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a line with three integers separated by spaces. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The input should be three integers. If the input contains any other data type, the program will crash.
3. **Arithmetic errors.** The program may have arithmetic errors if the numbers are too large. For example, the following code will have an arithmetic error:

```
a, b, k = map(int, input().split())
print(a + b + k)
```

This code will try to add three integers that are too large, and the result will be too large to be represented as an integer.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** The program may have off-by-one errors if the logic is not correct. For example, the following code will have an off-by-one error:

```
a, b, k = map(int, input().split())
count = 0
for i in range(a, b + 1):
    if i % k == 0:
        count += 1
print(count)
```

This code will not count the number 1, because it is not in the range `[a, b]`.
5. **Incorrect logic.** The program may have incorrect logic if the algorithm is not correct. For example, the following code will have incorrect logic:

```
a, b, k = map(int, input().split())
count = 0
for i in range(a, b + 1):
    if i % k == 0:
        count += 1
print(count)
```

This code will count the number of numbers in the range `[a, b]` that are divisible by k, but it will not count the number of numbers in the range `[a, b]` that have k as their smallest divisor.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format, data types, and logic of the program.

Title:
CODEFORCES 85_E. Guard Towers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect sorting**. The input is not sorted, so the algorithm will not work correctly.
2. **Using the wrong formula for distance**. The distance between two points is not equal to the sum of the absolute values of their coordinates.
3. **Using the wrong algorithm**. The algorithm should find the minimum distance between two points, not the maximum.
4. **Using the wrong data type**. The input data may be too large for the data type you are using.
5. **Off-by-one errors**. Make sure that you are not missing or counting one or more elements.
6. **Arithmetic errors**. Make sure that you are computing the correct values.
7. **Memory errors**. Make sure that you are not allocating too much memory or running out of memory.
8. **Time errors**. Make sure that your algorithm is running in a reasonable amount of time.

Title:
CODEFORCES 886_E. Maximum Element

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulo operation.** The modulo operation is a binary operation that takes two integers as operands and returns the remainder of the first operand divided by the second. For example, 10 mod 3 is 1, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1. When working with large numbers, it is important to be careful with modulo operations, as it is easy to make mistakes. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
a = 1000000000000000000
b = 3
print(a % b)
```

The output of this code will be 0, because the modulo operator only returns the remainder of the division, and in this case, the remainder is 0. To get the correct answer, we need to use the bitwise AND operator (^). The following code will work correctly:

```
a = 1000000000000000000
b = 3
print(a & (b - 1))
```

2. **Incorrect use of the factorial function.** The factorial function is a mathematical function that returns the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given number. For example, 5! is equal to 120, because 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 is equal to 120. When working with large numbers, it is important to be careful with the factorial function, as it can quickly become very large. For example, 100! is equal to 9.332621544394415e157, which is a number with over 300 digits. To avoid overflow errors, it is important to use a bignum library when working with large factorials.

3. **Incorrect use of the binomial coefficient.** The binomial coefficient is a mathematical function that gives the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items. For example, the binomial coefficient (5, 2) is equal to 10, because there are 10 ways to choose 2 items from a set of 5 items. When working with large numbers, it is important to be careful with the binomial coefficient, as it can quickly become very large. For example, the binomial coefficient (100, 50) is equal to 1.910034205865117e85, which is a number with over 200 digits. To avoid overflow errors, it is important to use a bignum library when working with large binomial coefficients.

4. **Incorrect use of the Catalan number.** The Catalan number is a mathematical function that gives the number of ways to arrange n non-attacking rooks on an n x n chessboard. For example, the Catalan number C(4) is equal to 5, because there are 5 ways to arrange 4 non-attacking rooks on a 4 x 4 chessboard. When working with large numbers, it is important to be careful with the Catalan number, as it can quickly become very large. For example, the Catalan number C(100) is equal to 1.461501637330902e45, which is a number with over 150 digits. To avoid overflow errors, it is important to use a bignum library when working with large Catalan numbers.

The input data is a list of integers, but the developer may accidentally use a different data type, such as a string or a float. This can lead to incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect parsing**

The developer may incorrectly parse the input data, leading to missing or incorrect values. For example, the developer may accidentally skip a line of input or misinterpret a value.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

The developer may make an off-by-one error when counting the number of tasks or dependencies. This can lead to incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect logic**

The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the algorithm, leading to incorrect results. For example, the developer may forget to consider all possible dependencies or may not account for all possible cases.

**5. Uninitialized variables**

The developer may forget to initialize variables, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may initialize a variable to a value that is not used in the program.

**6. Memory leaks**

The developer may create a memory leak, which can lead to the program running out of memory. For example, the developer may create a variable that is never freed.

**7. Race conditions**

The developer may create a race condition, which can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing. For example, the developer may access a shared variable without locking it.

**8. Deadlocks**

The developer may create a deadlock, which can lead to the program being stuck in an infinite loop. For example, the developer may create two threads that are each waiting for the other to finish.

**9. Security vulnerabilities**

The developer may introduce a security vulnerability, which can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or system. For example, the developer may expose a sensitive data to an attacker.

CODEFORCES 931_B. World Cup

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a single line containing three integers separated by spaces. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to parse the input and will produce an error.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single line containing either "Final!" or an integer. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will produce an error.
3. **Off-by-one error.** When computing the round in which the two teams can meet, it is important to make sure that you account for the fact that the first round has only two teams. If you forget to do this, you will get the wrong answer.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The logic for computing the round in which the two teams can meet is relatively simple, but it is important to make sure that you understand it correctly. If you make a mistake in your logic, you will get the wrong answer.
5. **Memory leak.** If you do not free up the memory that you allocate during the execution of your program, you will eventually run out of memory and your program will crash. It is important to make sure that you free up any memory that you allocate as soon as you are finished with it.

CODEFORCES 958_E3. Guard Duty (hard)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input contains a line with more than two integers, the program may not be able to parse it correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to produce incorrect results. For example, if the output contains a line with less than one integer, the program may not be able to produce a valid solution.
3. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect, which may cause the program to produce incorrect results. For example, if the algorithm does not take into account the fact that the segments cannot intersect, the program may produce a solution that violates this constraint.
4. **Incorrect data.** The data used to test the program may be incorrect, which may cause the program to produce incorrect results. For example, if the data contains two points that are on the same line, the program may not be able to find a valid solution.
5. **Bugs in the implementation.** The program may contain bugs that cause it to produce incorrect results. For example, if the program does not correctly handle overflows, it may produce incorrect results for large inputs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 985_B. Switches and Lamps

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input contains two integers n and m, which represent the number of switches and the number of lamps, respectively. These values should be of type int. However, if the developer accidentally uses a different data type, such as float, the program will not work correctly.

**2. Forgetting to initialize variables**

Before using a variable, it is important to initialize it with a value. For example, the variable `count` is used to keep track of the number of lamps that are turned on. If the developer forgets to initialize `count`, the program will not work correctly.

**3. Using incorrect loops**

The program uses two nested loops to iterate over the switches and the lamps. The outer loop iterates over the switches, and the inner loop iterates over the lamps. If the developer uses the wrong type of loop, the program will not work correctly.

**4. Incorrect logic**

The program uses the following logic to determine if there is a switch that can be ignored:

1. Iterate over the switches.
2. For each switch, check if all of the lamps that it turns on are also turned on by another switch.
3. If all of the lamps that a switch turns on are also turned on by another switch, then the switch can be ignored.

If the developer's logic is incorrect, the program will not work correctly.

**5. Using incorrect code**

The program uses the following code to print the output:

```
if (count == m) {
    cout << "YES" << endl;
} else {
    cout << "NO" << endl;
}
```

If the developer accidentally uses incorrect code, the program will not work correctly.

**6. Not handling errors correctly**

The program should handle errors correctly. For example, if the input file does not exist, the program should exit with an error message.

**7. Not testing the program**

It is important to test the program thoroughly before releasing it. This will help to identify any bugs that may be present.
Test inputs:
```
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    bool a[n][m];

        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            cin >> a[i][j];
        }
    }

    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            if (a[i][j] == 1) {
                flag = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!flag) {

        }
    }

    if (count == 1) {
        cout << "YES" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "NO" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Incorrect data types**

```
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    bool a[n][m];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            cin >> a[i][j];
        }
    }

    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        bool flag = false;
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            if (a[i][j] == 1) {
                flag = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!flag) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    if (count == 1) {
        cout << "YES" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "NO" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This program will not work correctly because the variable `count` is of type int, but the value of `count` is greater than 2000.

**Forgetting to initialize variables**

```
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    bool a[n][m];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            cin >> a[i][j];
        }
    }

    int count;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        bool flag = false;
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            if (a[i][j] == 1) {
                flag = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!flag) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    if (count == 1) {
        cout << "YES" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "NO" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This program will not work correctly because the variable `count` is not initialized before it is used.

**Using incorrect loops**

```
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    bool a[n][m];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The developer may make a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer might forget to account for the fact that the string must contain at least one of each character, or they might not correctly calculate the number of possible strings.
2. **Incorrect input validation.** The developer may not correctly validate the input, which could lead to errors. For example, the developer might not check that the input is a valid integer, or they might not check that the input is within the specified range.
3. **Incorrect output formatting.** The developer may not correctly format the output, which could make it difficult to read and understand. For example, the developer might not use the correct number of digits, or they might not use the correct delimiters.
4. **Memory leaks.** The developer may not correctly free up memory that is no longer needed, which could lead to memory leaks. Memory leaks can eventually cause the program to crash.
5. **Race conditions.** The developer may not correctly synchronize access to shared data, which could lead to race conditions. Race conditions can cause the program to produce incorrect results or to crash.
6. **Deadlocks.** The developer may not correctly handle deadlocks, which can cause the program to hang indefinitely.
7. **Security vulnerabilities.** The developer may not correctly implement security features, which could allow attackers to exploit the program. For example, the developer might not correctly validate user input, or they might not use strong encryption algorithms.

Title:
HACKEREARTH bogo-sort-1

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect sorting algorithm**

The most common mistake is to use an incorrect sorting algorithm. For example, bubble sort or selection sort are both O(n^2) algorithms, which means that they will take quadratic time to sort an array of size n. This is prohibitively slow for large arrays.

**2. Using a naive implementation of the Bogosort algorithm**

The Bogosort algorithm is a very simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly shuffling the array until it is sorted. This algorithm is very inefficient, and it is not recommended for use in production code.

**3. Not handling edge cases correctly**

When sorting an array, it is important to handle edge cases correctly. For example, what happens if the array is empty? What happens if the array contains duplicate elements? It is important to make sure that your code handles these cases gracefully.

**4. Not using a robust data structure**

When sorting an array, it is important to use a robust data structure that can handle unexpected inputs. For example, if you are sorting an array of strings, you should use a string array instead of a char array. This will prevent your code from crashing if the input contains invalid characters.

**5. Not testing your code thoroughly**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before deploying it to production. This will help you to catch any bugs that may have been introduced during development. You should test your code with a variety of input data, including small arrays, large arrays, and arrays with duplicate elements.

Title:
HACKEREARTH cubic-currency

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly calculating the number of ways to pay a given amount.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. The key to getting the correct answer is to understand that the number of ways to pay a given amount is the same as the number of ways to express that amount as a sum of cubes. For example, the number of ways to pay 21 cubes is the same as the number of ways to express 21 as a sum of cubes, which is 3 (21 = 1 + 8 + 12).
2. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. The most efficient algorithm is the dynamic programming algorithm, which takes O(n) time and O(n) space, where n is the amount to be paid.
3. **Using incorrect data types.** The data types used to represent the amount to be paid and the number of ways to pay that amount must be large enough to accommodate the largest possible value. For example, if the amount to be paid is 10000, then the data type used to represent the amount must be at least 4 bytes long.
4. **Not handling edge cases correctly.** There are a few edge cases that developers should be aware of when solving this problem. For example, if the amount to be paid is 0, then the number of ways to pay that amount is 1. Additionally, if the amount to be paid is greater than the largest possible value that can be represented by the data type used to represent the amount, then the number of ways to pay that amount is 0.
5. **Not testing the code correctly.** It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. This can be done by creating a set of test cases that cover all of the possible scenarios that the code could encounter. Additionally, the code should be tested with both positive and negative values to ensure that it handles both cases correctly.

Title:
HACKEREARTH special-numbers-7

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain the number of test cases T, and each of the next T lines should contain one integer n. However, a developer may accidentally mistype the input format, or they may not properly handle invalid input. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to find the nth lucky number must be correct. A developer may make a mistake in their algorithm, or they may use an inefficient algorithm that takes too long to run. This could lead to the program running slowly or producing incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the program should output T lines, each containing the corresponding lucky number for that test case. However, a developer may accidentally mistype the output format, or they may not properly handle invalid output. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
4. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, they may accidentally use a variable that has not been initialized, or they may make a mistake in their error handling. These bugs could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.

Title:
HACKEREARTH trailing-zeroes-2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect factorial calculation.** The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120. When calculating the number of trailing zeros in a factorial, it is important to be careful not to include any numbers that are not factors of 5. For example, 25! includes the factor 25, which is not a factor of 5, so it should not be included in the calculation of the number of trailing zeros.
2. **Incorrect handling of negative numbers.** The factorial of a negative number is not defined. If a negative number is passed to the function, it should be ignored and the function should return 0.
3. **Incorrect handling of non-integer numbers.** The factorial of a non-integer number is not defined. If a non-integer number is passed to the function, it should be ignored and the function should return 0.
4. **Incorrect handling of large numbers.** The factorial of a large number can be very large. If a large number is passed to the function, it is important to be careful not to overflow the stack or the integer data type.
5. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.** Floating-point numbers are often used to represent fractional values. However, floating-point numbers are not always accurate, and they can sometimes produce incorrect results. It is important to be careful when using floating-point numbers in calculations involving factorials.
6. **Incorrect use of recursion.** Recursion is a powerful programming technique, but it can also be dangerous. If a recursive function is not written correctly, it can enter an infinite loop. It is important to be careful when using recursion to calculate the number of trailing zeros in a factorial.

ATCODER p02575 AtCoder Beginner Contest 177 - I hate Shortest Path Problem

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem states that "you cannot move down from the A_i-th, (A_i + 1)-th, \ldots, B_i-th squares from the left in the i-th row from the top". This means that you cannot move down from any square in the range `[A_i, B_i)`. However, some developers might incorrectly assume that you can move down from any square except for the squares in the range `[A_i, B_i)`. This would lead to incorrect solutions.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution to this problem involves dynamic programming. Some developers might make mistakes in their implementation of the dynamic programming algorithm, which would lead to incorrect solutions.
3. **Incorrect testing of the solution.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. Some developers might not test their solution enough, which could lead to them missing bugs.
4. **Incorrect submission of the solution.** Once you have verified that your solution is correct, you need to submit it to the AtCoder judging system. Some developers might make mistakes when submitting their solution, which could lead to them receiving a wrong answer.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement, carefully implement the solution, thoroughly test the solution, and correctly submit the solution.

Title:
ATCODER p02835 AtCoder Beginner Contest 147 - Blackjack

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input consists of three integers, so the developer should use an integer data type to store them. However, if the developer accidentally uses a floating-point data type, the results may be incorrect. For example, if the input is `5 7 9`, the sum of the three integers is 21. However, if the developer uses a floating-point data type, the sum may be rounded up to 22, which would result in the incorrect output of `bust`.

**2. Not checking for invalid input**

The input consists of three integers, but the problem statement only specifies that the integers must be between 1 and 13. The developer should check for invalid input, such as negative integers or integers greater than 13. If invalid input is encountered, the developer should print an error message and exit the program.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The problem statement states that if the sum of the three integers is greater than or equal to 22, the output should be `bust`. However, the developer may accidentally use incorrect logic and print `bust` when the sum is less than 22. For example, the developer may mistakenly think that the sum of the three integers must be exactly 22 in order for the output to be `bust`.

**4. Not using proper indentation**

The code should be properly indented to make it easier to read and understand. If the code is not properly indented, it may be difficult to debug.

**5. Using global variables**

Global variables should be avoided whenever possible. Global variables can make it difficult to track the flow of the program and can lead to unexpected bugs.

**6. Not using comments**

Comments should be used to explain the purpose of the code and to make it easier to understand. If the code is not properly commented, it may be difficult to debug.

**7. Not testing the code**

The code should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly. The developer should test the code with a variety of inputs and verify that the output is correct.

ATCODER p03108 AtCoder Beginner Contest 120 - Decayed Bridges

Pain points:
**1. Incorrectly counting the number of pairs of islands that are no longer connected after a bridge collapses.**

A common mistake is to only consider the pairs of islands that are directly connected by the collapsed bridge. However, it is also necessary to consider the pairs of islands that are indirectly connected by the collapsed bridge. For example, if the bridge between islands A and B collapses, then the pairs of islands (A, C) and (B, C) are also no longer connected.

**2. Using an incorrect data structure to represent the bridges.**

The bridges can be represented in a variety of ways, such as an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix. The choice of data structure will affect the performance of the algorithm.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm to find the inconvenience.**

The inconvenience can be found using a variety of algorithms, such as a depth-first search or a breadth-first search. The choice of algorithm will affect the performance of the algorithm.

**4. Not handling the case where the input is invalid.**

The input may be invalid in a variety of ways, such as if there are no bridges, if there are duplicate bridges, or if the bridges are not connected. The algorithm must be able to handle these cases gracefully.

**5. Not handling the case where the output is too large.**

The output may be too large to fit into a 32-bit integer type. The algorithm must be able to handle this case by using a larger integer type.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input is a list of strings, but the developer may accidentally treat it as a list of integers. This would cause the program to crash.

**2. Off-by-one error**

The developer may accidentally iterate over the list of strings one element too many or one element too few. This would cause the program to output an incorrect answer.

**3. Missing or incorrect boundary check**

The developer may forget to check if the list of strings is empty, or if the length of the list is less than the number of cards. This would cause the program to crash or output an incorrect answer.

**4. Incorrect logic**

The developer may incorrectly implement the logic for finding the maximum number of yen that Takahashi can earn. This would cause the program to output an incorrect answer.

**5. Using the wrong data structure**

The developer may use the wrong data structure to store the list of strings. This could lead to the program running slowly or using more memory than necessary.

ATCODER p03571 CODE FESTIVAL 2017 qual C - Cubes

Pain points:
**1. Overflow**

The output is modulo 10^9 + 7. However, the intermediate results may be much larger than 10^9 + 7. For example, if A = B = C = 10^9, and D = 1, then the number of blocks that satisfy the condition is 10^27. This is much larger than 10^9 + 7.

To avoid overflow, we can use the following trick. Let f(x) be the number of blocks that satisfy the condition, where x is the distance between the block (x, y, z) and the wire. Then, we can write f(x) as

```
f(x) = f(x - 1) + f(x - 2) + ... + f(x - D)
```

This is because the number of blocks that satisfy the condition, where x is the distance between the block (x, y, z) and the wire, is the same as the number of blocks that satisfy the condition, where x - 1 is the distance between the block (x - 1, y, z) and the wire, and so on.

We can then compute f(x) using dynamic programming.

**2. Incorrect modulo operation**

Another common mistake is to use the wrong modulo operation. For example, if A = B = C = 10^9, and D = 1, then the number of blocks that satisfy the condition is 10^27. However, if we use the modulo operation `%`, then the answer will be 0. This is because `10^27 % 10^9 + 7 = 0`.

To avoid this mistake, we can use the following trick. Let f(x) be the number of blocks that satisfy the condition, where x is the distance between the block (x, y, z) and the wire. Then, we can write f(x) as

```
f(x) = f(x - 1) + f(x - 2) + ... + f(x - D)
```

This is because the number of blocks that satisfy the condition, where x is the distance between the block (x, y, z) and the wire, is the same as the number of blocks that satisfy the condition, where x - 1 is the distance between the block (x - 1, y, z) and the wire, and so on.

We can then compute f(x) using dynamic programming.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the distance between two blocks**

The distance between two blocks (x, y, z) and (x', y', z') is given by

```
max(|x - x'|, |y - y'|, |z - z'|)
```

However, it is important to note that the distance between two blocks is not always an integer. For example, if (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0) and (x', y', z') = (1, 1, 1), then the distance between the two blocks is √3, which is not an integer.

To avoid this problem, we can round the distance between two blocks to the nearest integer. For example, if the distance between two blocks is √3, then we can round it to 2.

**4. Incorrect calculation of the number of blocks that satisfy the condition**

The number of blocks that satisfy the condition is given by

```
f(D) = f(D - 1) + f(D - 2) + ... + f(0)
```

However, it is important to note that the number of blocks that satisfy the condition is not always a non-negative integer. For example, if A = B = C = 10^9, and D = 1, then the number of blocks that satisfy the condition is 10^27. This is because there are 10^27 blocks in total.

To avoid this problem, we can use the following trick. Let f(x) be the number of blocks that satisfy the condition, where x is the distance between the block (x, y, z) and the wire. Then, we can write f(x) as

```
f(x) = f(x - 1) + f(x - 2) + ... + f(x - D)
```

This is because the number of blocks that satisfy the condition, where x is the distance between the block (x, y, z) and the wire, is

Title:
ATCODER p03726 AtCoder Grand Contest 014 - Black and White Tree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrectly handling the input data.** The input data is a list of integers representing the edges of a tree. The first integer is the number of vertices in the tree, and the remaining integers are pairs of vertices that are connected by an edge. It is important to make sure that the input data is valid, and that it is correctly parsed into a list of edges.
2. **Incorrectly implementing the game rules.** The game is played by two players, Takahashi and Aoki. Takahashi starts by choosing a vertex to paint white. Aoki then chooses a vertex to paint black. The players continue to take turns painting vertices until all of the vertices have been colored. After all of the vertices have been colored, the vertices that are adjacent to a black vertex are repainted black. The winner of the game is the player who has more white vertices remaining. It is important to correctly implement the game rules, and to make sure that the winner is correctly determined.
3. **Incorrectly handling the repainting step.** After all of the vertices have been colored, the vertices that are adjacent to a black vertex are repainted black. It is important to correctly implement this step, and to make sure that all of the affected vertices are repainted.
4. **Incorrectly determining the winner of the game.** The winner of the game is the player who has more white vertices remaining. It is important to correctly determine the winner of the game, and to make sure that the correct output is printed.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly handling the input data.** A developer might incorrectly parse the input data, and end up with an incorrect list of edges. This could lead to the game being incorrectly played, and the wrong winner being determined.
* **Incorrectly implementing the game rules.** A developer might incorrectly implement the game rules, and end up with a game that is not played correctly. This could lead to the wrong winner being determined.
* **Incorrectly handling the repainting step.** A developer might incorrectly implement the repainting step, and end up with some of the vertices being repainted incorrectly. This could lead to the wrong winner being determined.
* **Incorrectly determining the winner of the game.** A developer might incorrectly determine the winner of the game, and end up with the wrong output being printed.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the dynamic programming algorithm**

The dynamic programming algorithm used to solve this problem is complex and error-prone. It is important to carefully verify the correctness of the algorithm before using it to solve the problem.

**3. Incorrect input handling**

The input for this problem is not well-formatted. It is important to carefully parse the input to ensure that it is correctly interpreted.

**4. Incorrect output formatting**

Title:
AIZU p00128 Abacus

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be a single integer between 0 and 9999. If the input is not in the correct format, the program should print an error message and exit.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a row of abacus beads, with each bead represented by a *, a blank space, or an = sign. The beads should be arranged in the correct order, with the least significant digit on the left and the most significant digit on the right.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When converting the input integer to a string, it is easy to make a mistake and add or subtract one from the number. This can cause the output to be incorrect.
4. **Indexing errors**. When iterating over the string representation of the number, it is easy to make a mistake and access an index that is out of bounds. This can cause the program to crash or output incorrect results.
5. **Memory leaks**. If the program does not properly free the memory that it allocates, it can eventually run out of memory and crash.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design the program and test it thoroughly. The following tips can help to prevent errors:

* Use a unit testing framework to test the individual components of the program.
* Write clear and concise code that is easy to understand.
* Use a debugger to track down errors that are difficult to find.
* Use a memory leak detector to find memory leaks that are not caught by the unit tests.

Title:
AIZU p00639 Accelerated Railgun

Pain points:
```
Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect calculation of the projectile's trajectory.** The projectile's trajectory is a parabola, and the developer must correctly calculate the equations for the x- and y-coordinates of the projectile at any given time. This is a common mistake, and it can lead to the projectile either missing the laboratory or hitting it at the wrong time.
* **Incorrect handling of collisions with the virtual wall.** When the projectile collides with the virtual wall, it must be reflected so that the incident angle is equal to the reflection angle. The developer must correctly implement this reflection, or the projectile may not hit the laboratory at all.
* **Incorrect calculation of the range of the railgun.** The range of the railgun is limited by the distance that the projectile can travel before it hits the ground or the virtual wall. The developer must correctly calculate this range, or the program may output an incorrect answer.
* **Incorrect output of the results.** The program must output the distance that the projectile traveled until it hit the laboratory. The developer must correctly format this output, or the program may not be accepted by the judge.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems and bugs:

* Use a good mathematical library to help you calculate the projectile's trajectory. This will help you avoid errors in your calculations.
* Carefully implement the reflection of the projectile when it collides with the virtual wall. Make sure that the incident angle is equal to the reflection angle.
* Carefully calculate the range of the railgun. Make sure that you take into account the distance that the projectile can travel before it hits the ground or the virtual wall.
* Carefully format the output of the results. Make sure that the distance that the projectile traveled is correct and that it is formatted in the correct way.
