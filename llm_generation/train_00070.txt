Title:
CODECHEF lucky1

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for storing the number of digits.**

The number of digits in a number can be very large, so it is important to use a data type that can store large numbers. For example, using an integer to store the number of digits in a number could result in an overflow error.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm to find the number of pairs of numbers that satisfy the given condition.**

The naive algorithm for finding the number of pairs of numbers that satisfy the given condition is to iterate over all possible pairs of numbers and check if they satisfy the condition. This algorithm is very inefficient, as it has a time complexity of O(N^2).

**3. Not handling special cases correctly.**

The problem statement specifies that the number of digits in a lucky number can only be 1, 2, or 3. However, the naive algorithm for finding the number of pairs of numbers that satisfy the given condition does not handle this case correctly.

**4. Using incorrect boundary conditions.**

The problem statement specifies that the number of test cases is at most 100000. However, the naive algorithm for finding the number of pairs of numbers that satisfy the given condition does not check this boundary condition. This could result in an infinite loop or a segmentation fault.

**5. Not handling errors correctly.**

The problem statement does not specify what to do if there is an error. The naive algorithm for finding the number of pairs of numbers that satisfy the given condition does not handle errors correctly. This could result in the program crashing or producing incorrect output.

CODEFORCES 1036_G. Sources and Sinks

Pain points:
**1. The graph may not be acyclic.**

The problem statement states that the graph is acyclic, but there is no guarantee that the input graph is actually acyclic. If the input graph is not acyclic, then the algorithm will not terminate and the program will crash.

**2. The graph may not have any sources or sinks.**

The problem statement states that the graph must have at least one source and one sink, but there is no guarantee that the input graph actually has any sources or sinks. If the input graph does not have any sources or sinks, then the algorithm will not terminate and the program will crash.

**3. The graph may have multiple edges between the same two vertices.**

The problem statement states that the graph must not have any multiple edges, but there is no guarantee that the input graph actually does not have any multiple edges. If the input graph does have multiple edges between the same two vertices, then the algorithm will not terminate and the program will crash.

**4. The graph may have self-loops.**

The problem statement states that the graph must not have any self-loops, but there is no guarantee that the input graph actually does not have any self-loops. If the input graph does have self-loops, then the algorithm will not terminate and the program will crash.

**5. The number of sources and sinks in the graph may not be the same.**

The problem statement states that the number of sources in the graph must be the same as the number of sinks, but there is no guarantee that the input graph actually satisfies this condition. If the number of sources and sinks in the graph are not the same, then the algorithm will not terminate and the program will crash.

**6. The number of sources and sinks in the graph may exceed 20.**

The problem statement states that the number of sources and sinks in the graph must not exceed 20, but there is no guarantee that the input graph actually satisfies this condition. If the number of sources and sinks in the graph exceeds 20, then the algorithm will not terminate and the program will crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 105_A. Transmigration

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is very strict, so it is important to make sure that the input is formatted correctly. For example, if the number of skills is not an integer, or if the skill level is not a number, or if the skill name contains non-lowercase Latin characters, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly and will produce an error.
2. **Incorrect calculation of skill levels**. The skill levels are reduced according to the k coefficient, but it is important to round the result to the nearest integer. For example, if the skill level is 123 and the k coefficient is 0.75, the skill level should be rounded to 92, not 91.5.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be in the following format:

```
z
skill_name1 skill_level1
skill_name2 skill_level2
...
```

where z is the number of skills, and skill_namei and skill_leveli are the name and level of the ith skill, respectively. It is important to make sure that the output is formatted correctly, or the grader will not be able to evaluate your solution correctly.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. There are a few edge cases that the program should be able to handle correctly. For example, if the number of skills is 0, the program should print 0 on the first line and nothing else. Similarly, if the number of skills specific to the class into which the character is transmigrating is 0, the program should not print any of those skills in the output.
5. **Memory leaks**. The program should not allocate any memory that it does not need, and it should free any memory that it allocates when it is finished using it. Memory leaks can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
6. **Synchronization issues**. If the program is multi-threaded, it is important to make sure that the threads are synchronized properly so that they do not interfere with each other. For example, if two threads are trying to access the same data at the same time, the program could crash.
7. **Race conditions**. A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time and the order in which the threads access the data affects the outcome. For example, if two threads are trying to increment the same variable at the same time, the final value of the variable could be either of the two values that the threads tried to increment it to.
8. **Deadlocks**. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, and none of the threads can continue until the other threads release the resources. For example, if two threads are both trying to lock the same mutex, neither thread will be able to continue until the other thread releases the mutex.
9. **Unhandled exceptions**. The program should handle any exceptions that it can, and it should print a descriptive error message if it encounters an exception that it cannot handle. Unhandled exceptions can cause the program to crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1121_F. Compress String

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is specified in the problem statement. Make sure that you are reading the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also specified in the problem statement. Make sure that you are outputting the correct answer.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm you are using may not be correct. Make sure that you understand the problem statement and the solution carefully.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. These are common mistakes that can be made when coding. Make sure that you are checking all of your boundary conditions carefully.
5. **Memory errors**. Make sure that your program is not using too much memory. You can use the `valgrind` tool to check for memory errors.
6. **Time errors**. Make sure that your program is running in a reasonable amount of time. You can use the `time` command to check the running time of your program.
7. **Compilation errors**. Make sure that your program compiles without any errors. You can use the `gcc` or `clang` compiler to compile your program.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrect input format:** The input format specifies that the first line should contain three integers, separated by spaces. However, the following code will not work correctly:

```
n, a, b = input().split()
```

This code will split the input string into three substrings, but it will not convert the substrings into integers. To fix this, you can use the `int()` function to convert the substrings into integers:

```
n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
```

2. **Incorrect output format:** The output format specifies that the output should be a single integer. However, the following code will not work correctly:

```
print(n, a, b)
```

This code will print the three integers on separate lines. To fix this, you can use the `print()` function with the `end` argument to print the integers on the same line:

```
print(n, a, b, end='')
```

3. **Incorrect algorithm:** The following algorithm is incorrect:

```
def compress(s):
  """Compresses the string s.

  Args:
    s: The string to compress.

  Returns:
    The number of coins used to compress the string.
  """

  n = len(s)
  cost = 0
  for i in range(n):
    if i == 0:
      cost += a
    else:
      if s[i] == s[i - 1]:
        cost += b
      else:
        cost += a
  return cost
```

This algorithm will not work correctly because it does not take into account the fact that a string can be a substring of itself. For example, the string `'aaa'` can be compressed as `'a3'`, which costs 3 coins. However, the algorithm above will compress the string as `'a', 'a', 'a'`, which costs 6 coins.

To fix this, we need to add a check to see if the current character is a substring of the previous characters. If it is, we can compress the string as a substring, which will cost less coins.

```
def compress(s):
  """Compresses the string s.

  Args:
    s: The string to compress.

  Returns:
    The number of coins used to compress the string.
  """

  n = len(s)
  cost = 0
  for i in range(n):
    if i == 0:
      cost += a
    else:
      if s[i] == s[i - 1]:
        cost += b
      else:
        cost += a
        if i > 1 and s[i] == s[i - 2]:
          cost -= b
  return cost
```

4. **Off-by-one errors:** Off-by-one errors are common mistakes that can be made when coding. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
def compress(s):
  """Compresses the string s.

  Args:
    s: The string to compress.

  Returns:
    The number of coins used to compress the string.

CODEFORCES 116_E. Plumber

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain more than two integers, or the integers may not be separated by a single space. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not strictly followed. For example, the output may not be a single integer, or the integer may not be modulo 1000003. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect data type**

The data type of the input and output may not be correct. For example, the input may be a string instead of an integer, or the output may be a float instead of an integer. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

When counting the number of possible configurations, it is important to make sure that you do not count the same configuration twice. This can be done by using a set to store the already-counted configurations.

**5. Undefined behavior**

The program may not be defined for all possible inputs. For example, the program may crash if the input is a negative number.

**6. Memory leaks**

The program may not properly free the memory that it allocates. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

**7. Race conditions**

The program may not be thread-safe. This can lead to incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.

**8. Deadlocks**

The program may deadlock if two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can prevent the program from making any progress.

**9. Security vulnerabilities**

The program may contain security vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system. For example, the program may not properly validate user input, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the program.

CODEFORCES 1225_F. Tree Factory

Pain points:
```
Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is specific, and it is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly. For example, if you are expecting a list of integers, but you receive a list of strings, your program will not work correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format for this problem is also specific, and it is important to make sure that you are printing the output in the correct format. For example, if you are expected to print a list of integers, but you print a list of strings, your program will not be accepted.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when you forget to add or subtract one from a variable. For example, if you are trying to iterate through a list of numbers, but you forget to add one to the index each time, you will end up with an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of your program is another common source of bugs. For example, if you are trying to find the maximum value in a list, but you forget to check for negative numbers, your program will not work correctly.
5. **Memory errors.** Memory errors can occur when your program allocates too much or too little memory. For example, if you allocate a large amount of memory for a variable that you only use for a short period of time, your program may run out of memory and crash.
6. **Timeout errors.** Timeout errors can occur when your program takes too long to run. For example, if your program is trying to solve a computationally difficult problem, it may time out before it can find a solution.
7. **Incorrect data structures.** The data structures that you use in your program can have a significant impact on its performance. For example, if you are using a linked list to store a large amount of data, your program may run slower than if you were using a hash table.
8. **Incorrect algorithms.** The algorithms that you use in your program can also have a significant impact on its performance. For example, if you are using a brute-force algorithm to solve a problem, your program may run much slower than if you were using a more efficient algorithm.
9. **Bugs in third-party libraries.** Third-party libraries can be a source of bugs in your program. For example, if you are using a library that has a bug, your program may crash or produce incorrect results.
10. **User errors.** User errors can also cause problems with your program. For example, if a user enters incorrect input, your program may not be able to process it correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 124_B. Permutations

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when reading the input data. For example, if the input contains a number with more than k digits, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect logic**

The logic of the program should be correct, otherwise the output will be incorrect. For example, if the program does not take into account the leading zeros, the output will be incorrect.

**3. Incorrect implementation**

The program should be implemented correctly, otherwise it will not work. For example, if the program uses a wrong algorithm to find the minimum difference between the largest and the smallest number, the output will be incorrect.

**4. Runtime errors**

The program should not have any runtime errors. For example, if the program uses an unbounded array, it will crash when it runs out of memory.

**5. Memory leaks**

The program should not have any memory leaks. For example, if the program does not free the memory allocated for an array, it will eventually run out of memory.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1268_E. Happy Cactus

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the DFS algorithm.** The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that can be used to traverse a graph. It works by starting at a given vertex and recursively exploring all of its adjacent vertices. One common mistake that developers make when implementing the DFS algorithm is to forget to mark the vertices that have already been visited. This can lead to the algorithm getting stuck in an infinite loop.

**2. Incorrect handling of cycles in the graph.** A cycle in a graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. When traversing a graph with the DFS algorithm, it is important to be able to detect cycles. If a cycle is detected, the algorithm should terminate immediately. Otherwise, the algorithm may get stuck in an infinite loop.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the number of happy pairs.** The number of happy pairs between two vertices is the number of increasing paths that start at one vertex and end at the other. To calculate this number, it is necessary to keep track of the number of edges that are incident to each vertex. This information can be used to determine the number of possible paths that can be taken from one vertex to another.

**4. Incorrect output of the results.** The output of the program should be a list of integers, one for each vertex in the graph. Each integer should represent the number of happy pairs between the vertex and all other vertices in the graph.

**5. Runtime errors.** The program may run into runtime errors if it is not properly designed or implemented. These errors can be caused by a variety of factors, such as incorrect memory management or incorrect handling of exceptions.

**6. Incorrect test cases.** The program should be tested with a variety of test cases to ensure that it is working correctly. The test cases should include graphs with different numbers of vertices and edges, as well as graphs with cycles.
Test inputs:

CODEFORCES 1311_A. Add Odd or Subtract Even

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect variable initialization**

```
a, b = map(int, input().split())
```

This code will fail if the input is `0 0`.

The correct way to initialize variables is:

```
a, b = 0, 0
try:
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
except ValueError:
    print(0)
```

**2. Using the wrong data type**

```
a, b = map(int, input().split())

print(abs(b - a) // 2)
```

This code will fail if `b - a` is not even.

The correct way to calculate the number of moves is:

```
a, b = map(int, input().split())

moves = abs(b - a) // 2
if b - a % 2 == 1:
    moves += 1

print(moves)
```

**3. Not handling the edge cases**

```
a, b = map(int, input().split())

if a == b:
    print(0)
else:
    print(abs(b - a) // 2)
```

This code will fail if `a` is less than `b`.

The correct way to handle the edge cases is:

```
a, b = map(int, input().split())

if a == b:
    print(0)
elif a < b:
    print(abs(b - a) // 2)

Title:
CODEFORCES 1354_B. Ternary String

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of pointers.** When using pointers to iterate over a string, it is important to make sure that the pointer is not pointing to invalid memory. This can happen if the string is shorter than the pointer, or if the pointer is incremented past the end of the string. To avoid this, it is important to check the length of the string before using a pointer to iterate over it.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of mistake that can occur when programming. They happen when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one, which can lead to incorrect results. When working with strings, it is important to be careful about off-by-one errors, as they can be difficult to find and fix.
3. **Incorrect use of substrings.** When working with substrings, it is important to make sure that the substring is valid. This means that the substring must be a contiguous part of the original string, and it must not contain any invalid characters. To avoid this, it is important to check the start and end indices of the substring before using it.
4. **Incorrect use of loops.** When using loops, it is important to make sure that the loop terminates correctly. This means that the loop should not run forever, and it should not skip any iterations. To avoid this, it is important to check the loop condition before each iteration.
5. **Incorrect use of conditions.** When using conditions, it is important to make sure that the condition is correct. This means that the condition should evaluate to true or false, and it should not evaluate to an unexpected value. To avoid this, it is important to carefully check the condition before using it.
6. **Incorrect use of functions.** When using functions, it is important to make sure that the function is called correctly. This means that the function should be called with the correct arguments, and it should not be called with invalid arguments. To avoid this, it is important to carefully read the documentation for the function before using it.
7. **Incorrect use of variables.** When using variables, it is important to make sure that the variables are initialized correctly. This means that the variables should be assigned a value before they are used, and they should not be assigned an invalid value. To avoid this, it is important to carefully initialize variables before using them.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1373_G. Pawns

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement states that "the current board may not always be good". This means that there may be some cases where the board is not good even after all the changes have been made. A developer who does not understand this may incorrectly assume that the board will always be good after all the changes have been made, and may not write code to handle the case where the board is not good.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for solving this problem is not trivial. A developer who does not implement the algorithm correctly may not be able to solve the problem correctly.
3. **Incorrect testing.** The developer should test their code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. This includes testing the code on a variety of inputs, including inputs that are not in the expected format, inputs that are invalid, and inputs that are intentionally designed to cause the code to fail.
4. **Incorrect submission.** The developer should make sure that they submit their code correctly. This includes making sure that the code is formatted correctly, that the code is in the correct format, and that the code is uploaded to the correct submission server.
5. **Incorrect runtime.** The developer should make sure that their code runs within the time limit specified in the problem statement. This may require the developer to optimize their code.
6. **Incorrect memory usage.** The developer should make sure that their code does not use too much memory. This may require the developer to use efficient data structures and algorithms.
7. **Incorrect output.** The developer should make sure that their code outputs the correct answer. This may require the developer to check the output carefully to make sure that it is correct.

CODEFORCES 1397_A. Juggling Letters

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**.

The input format of the problem is:
```
The first line contains t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10): the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000): the number of strings.

n lines follow, the i-th line contains s_i (1 ≤ \lvert s_i \rvert ≤ 1000).

The sum of lengths of all strings in all test cases does not exceed 1000.
```

If the input format is not correct, the program will crash. For example, if the input is `1` instead of `t`, the program will crash.

**2. The output format is not correct**.

The output format of the problem is:
```
If it is possible to make the strings equal, print "YES" (without quotes).

Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).
```

If the output format is not correct, the program will crash. For example, if the output is `yes` instead of `YES`, the program will crash.

**3. The program does not handle the corner cases**.

The problem states that `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`. If the input is `n > 1000`, the program will crash.

**4. The program has a bug**.

The program may have a bug that causes it to output the wrong answer. For example, the program may output `YES` when the answer should be `NO`.

**5. The program is inefficient**.

The program may be inefficient and run in a long time. For example, the program may use a brute-force approach that takes a long time to run.

**6. The program is not well-written**.

The program may be difficult to read and understand. For example, the program may use a lot of global variables or have a lot of nested loops.

CODEFORCES 353_E. Antichain

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly handling the input data.** The input data may contain invalid characters or a number of vertices that is too large. Make sure to check for these conditions and handle them appropriately.
2. **Not considering all possible antichains.** An antichain is a set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are comparable. When finding the maximum antichain, you need to consider all possible sets of vertices and find the one with the largest size.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are many different algorithms that can be used to find the maximum antichain in a directed acyclic graph. Make sure to use an algorithm that is both efficient and correct.
4. **Making a mistake in your implementation.** Even if you use the correct algorithm, you can still make mistakes in your implementation. Be careful to check your code for errors before submitting it.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that you may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly handling the input data.** For example, you might assume that the input data will always be valid, when in reality it may contain invalid characters or a number of vertices that is too large. If you encounter this problem, you can check for invalid input data using the `isdigit()` function in Python or the `isalnum()` function in C++. You can also check for a number of vertices that is too large by using the `len()` function in Python or the `std::size()` function in C++.
* **Not considering all possible antichains.** For example, you might only consider antichains that are formed by consecutive vertices in the input data. However, there may be other antichains that are not formed by consecutive vertices. To avoid this problem, you can use a backtracking algorithm to generate all possible antichains.
* **Using an incorrect algorithm.** For example, you might use a greedy algorithm to find the maximum antichain. However, greedy algorithms are not always guaranteed to find the optimal solution. To avoid this problem, you can use a more sophisticated algorithm, such as a dynamic programming algorithm.
* **Making a mistake in your implementation.** For example, you might forget to initialize a variable or you might use the wrong data type. To avoid this problem, you should carefully check your code for errors before submitting it.

```

### Possible Problems

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correct. For example, the input may contain a string instead of an integer.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correct. For example, the output may contain a string instead of an integer.
* **Incorrect algorithm:** The algorithm may not be correct. For example, the algorithm may not find the optimal solution.
* **Memory limit exceeded:** The algorithm may use too much memory. For example, the algorithm may create a large array.
* **Time limit exceeded:** The algorithm may take too long to run. For example, the algorithm may be exponential.

### Possible Bugs

* **Off-by-one error:** The algorithm may make a mistake in the index of an array or list. For example, the algorithm may access an element that is out of bounds.
* **Arithmetic error:** The algorithm may make a mistake in an arithmetic operation. For example, the algorithm may divide by zero.
* **Null pointer dereference:** The algorithm may try to access a memory location that is not initialized. For example, the algorithm may try to access an element of an array that does not exist.
* **Infinite loop:** The algorithm may enter an infinite loop. For example, the algorithm may not have any terminating condition.

### How to Avoid These Problems

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format and output format. It is also important to carefully design the algorithm and to test it thoroughly. It is also important to be aware of the potential problems that can occur and to take steps to avoid them.

CODEFORCES 449_B. Jzzhu and Cities

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type.** The input data is given as a string, but the developer may mistakenly parse it as an integer. This would lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect algorithm.** The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. This could lead to incorrect results or a time-consuming solution.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** The developer may make a mistake when counting or indexing elements in the data. This could lead to incorrect results.
4. **Memory leaks.** The developer may not properly free memory that is allocated during the execution of the program. This could lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
5. **Synchronization issues.** The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data between multiple threads. This could lead to incorrect results or a deadlock.
6. **Security vulnerabilities.** The developer may introduce security vulnerabilities into the program by not properly validating user input or by using insecure coding practices. This could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or the system it is running on.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully review their code and test it thoroughly before deploying it to production. They should also use a debugger to identify and fix any errors that are found.

CODEFORCES 470_A. Crystal Ball Sequence

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect formula.** The formula for the nth element of the crystal ball sequence is `Hn = 3n(n + 1) + 1`. Some developers may accidentally use the formula `Hn = 3n^2 + 1` instead, which will result in incorrect output.
2. **Off-by-one error.** When computing the value of Hn, it is important to make sure that the index of the first element of the sequence is 0, not 1. Some developers may accidentally start the sequence with index 1, which will result in an off-by-one error in the output.
3. **Boundary cases.** The crystal ball sequence is defined for all non-negative integers n. Some developers may accidentally try to compute the value of Hn for a negative value of n, which will result in an error.
4. **Incorrect input handling.** The input for this problem is a single line containing an integer n. Some developers may accidentally read the input incorrectly, which will result in an incorrect output.
5. **Incorrect output formatting.** The output for this problem should be a single integer, representing the value of Hn. Some developers may accidentally output the value of Hn in a different format, such as a string or a list of numbers.
Test inputs:
1. Incorrect formula
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 493_D. Vasya and Chess

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 109). If the input is not in this format, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output for this problem should be a string "white" or "black", depending on who wins if the both players play optimally. If the answer is "white", then you should also print two integers r and c representing the cell (r, c), where the first player should make his first move to win. If there are multiple such cells, print the one with the minimum r. If there are still multiple squares, print the one with the minimum c. If the output is not in this format, the program will not produce the correct answer.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic for this problem is relatively simple. The first player should always try to capture the black queen, and the second player should always try to capture the white queen. However, there are a few edge cases that the developer should be aware of. For example, if the white queen is on the same row as the black queen, the white player cannot capture the black queen on the first move. In this case, the white player should capture a green pawn on the same row as the black queen.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that can occur when programming. In this problem, an off-by-one error could occur if the developer accidentally indexes the array one element past the end of the array. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
5. **Memory leaks.** Memory leaks can occur when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing. To avoid memory leaks, the developer should make sure to free any memory that is no longer needed.
6. **Race conditions.** Race conditions can occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash. To avoid race conditions, the developer should use synchronization mechanisms to ensure that only one thread can access the data at a time.
7. **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely. To avoid deadlocks, the developer should make sure that each thread releases all of its locks before waiting for another thread to release a lock.
8. **Unhandled exceptions.** Unhandled exceptions can occur when the program encounters an error that it cannot handle. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. To avoid unhandled exceptions, the developer should catch any exceptions that the program might throw and handle them appropriately.
9. **Security vulnerabilities.** Security vulnerabilities can occur when the program does not properly protect its data. This can allow attackers to access sensitive data or take control of the program. To avoid security vulnerabilities, the developer should make sure to use secure coding practices.
10. **Performance bottlenecks.** Performance bottlenecks can occur when the program takes too long to run. This can make the program unusable or cause it to crash. To avoid performance bottlenecks, the developer should optimize the program's performance.

CODEFORCES 518_C. Anya and Smartphone

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

1. **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not specified clearly. For example, it is not clear whether the integers in the input should be separated by spaces or not. This could lead to the program crashing or giving incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not specified clearly. For example, it is not clear whether the output should be a single integer or a list of integers. This could lead to the program crashing or giving incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect data type:** The data types of the input and output values are not specified clearly. For example, it is not clear whether the integers in the input should be interpreted as signed or unsigned integers. This could lead to the program crashing or giving incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect assumptions:** The program may make incorrect assumptions about the input data. For example, the program may assume that the input data is always valid, even if it is not. This could lead to the program crashing or giving incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect logic:** The program may contain incorrect logic. For example, the program may not correctly calculate the number of gestures that Anya needs to make. This could lead to the program giving incorrect results.
6. **Incorrect implementation:** The program may be incorrectly implemented. For example, the program may use inefficient algorithms or data structures. This could lead to the program running slowly or using too much memory.

Title:
CODEFORCES 544_C. Writing Code

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect modulo arithmetic**

One common mistake is to perform modulo arithmetic incorrectly. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
n, m, b, mod = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        ans += a[i]
        ans %= mod

print(ans)
```

This code would incorrectly count the number of good plans, because it would not take into account the fact that the number of bugs in a plan can be greater than b. To fix this, we need to use the following formula:

```
ans = sum([a[i] * (m - i) for i in range(n)]) % mod
```

This formula correctly counts the number of good plans, because it takes into account the fact that the number of bugs in a plan can be greater than b.

**2. Incorrect use of the binomial coefficient**

Another common mistake is to incorrectly use the binomial coefficient. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
n, m, b, mod = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 1
for i in range(n):
    ans *= (m - i + b - 1) // (b - 1)
    ans %= mod

print(ans)
```

This code would incorrectly count the number of good plans, because it would not take into account the fact that the number of bugs in a plan can be less than b. To fix this, we need to use the following formula:

```
ans = (m + b - 1) ** n // (b - 1) ** n % mod
```

This formula correctly counts the number of good plans, because it takes into account the fact that the number of bugs in a plan can be less than b.

**3. Incorrect use of the Euler's totient function**

Another common mistake is to incorrectly use the Euler's totient function. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
n, m, b, mod = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = phi(mod) ** n

print(ans)
```

This code would incorrectly count the number of good plans, because it would not take into account the fact that the number of bugs in a plan can be greater than b. To fix this, we need to use the following formula:

```
ans = phi(b) ** n % mod
```

This formula correctly counts the number of good plans, because it takes into account the fact that the number of bugs in a plan can be greater than b.

**4. Incorrect use of the Chinese remainder theorem**

Another common mistake is to incorrectly use the Chinese remainder theorem. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
n, m, b, mod = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    ans += pow(a[i], m, mod)
    ans %= mod

print(ans)
```

This code would incorrectly count the number of good plans, because it would not take into account the fact that the number of bugs in a plan can be greater than b. To fix this, we need to use the following formula:

```
ans = pow(prod(a), m, mod) % mod
```

This formula correctly counts the number of good plans, because it takes into account the fact that the number of bugs in a plan can be greater than b.

CODEFORCES 570_E. Pig and Palindromes

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is not very straightforward, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading in the data. For example, if you forget to read in the number of rows and columns, or if you read in the data in the wrong order, your program will not work correctly.
* **Incorrect implementation of the palindrome algorithm:** The palindrome algorithm is a bit tricky to implement correctly, and it is easy to make a mistake. For example, if you forget to check for the special case of a palindrome of length 1, or if you forget to handle the case where the first and last characters of the string are different, your program will not work correctly.
* **Incorrect handling of edge cases:** There are a few edge cases that you need to be aware of when solving this problem. For example, if the input string is empty, or if the input string is a palindrome of length 1, your program should return 1.
* **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic:** Modulo arithmetic is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a variety of problems, but it is important to use it correctly. For example, if you forget to add 1 to the result of your modulo operation, your program will not work correctly.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** One common mistake that developers make is to forget to read in the number of rows and columns. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
```

This code will only read in the first line of input, which is the number of rows. To read in the number of columns, you need to use the following code:

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
```

* **Incorrect implementation of the palindrome algorithm:** Another common mistake that developers make is to implement the palindrome algorithm incorrectly. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
def is_palindrome(s):
  for i in range(len(s) // 2):
    if s[i] != s[-i - 1]:
      return False
  return True
```

This code only checks for palindromes of even length. To check for palindromes of any length, you need to use the following code:

```
def is_palindrome(s):
  for i in range(len(s) // 2):
    if s[i] != s[-i - 1]:
      return False
  return True
```

* **Incorrect handling of edge cases:** Another common mistake that developers make is to not handle edge cases correctly. For example, the following code will not work correctly if the input string is empty:

```
def count_palindromes(s):
  if len(s) == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    return 0
```

To handle the case where the input string is empty, you need to use the following code:

```
def count_palindromes(s):
  if len(s) == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    return count_palindromes(s[1:]) + count_palindromes(s[:-1])
```

* **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic:** Another common mistake that developers make is to use modulo arithmetic incorrectly. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
def count_palindromes(s):
  count = 0
  for i in range(len(s)):
    count += is_palindrome(s[i:]) % 109 + 7
  return count
```

This code will not work correctly because the result of the modulo operation is not being added to the `count` variable. To fix this, you need to use the following code:

```
def count_palindromes(s):
  count = 0
  for i in range(len(s)):
    count += (is_palindrome(s[i:]) % 109 + 7)
  return count
```
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect input format:**

```
3 4
aaab
baaa
abba
```

This input is incorrect because it does not have the correct number of rows and columns. The correct input should be:

```
3 4
aaab
baaa
abba
```

2. **Incorrect implementation of the palindrome algorithm:**

```
def is_palindrome(s):
  for i in range(len(s) // 2):
    if s[i] != s[-i - 1]:
      return False
  return True
```

This implementation of the palindrome algorithm is incorrect because it only checks for palindromes of even length. To check for palindromes of any length, you need to use the following code:

```
def is_palindrome(s):
  for i in range(len(s)):
    if s[i] != s[-i - 1]:
      return False
  return True
```

3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases:**

```
def count_palindromes(s):
  if len(s) == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    return 0
```

This implementation of the `count_palindromes` function is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the input string is empty. To handle this case, you need to use the following code:

```
def count_palindromes(s):
  if len(s) == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    return count_palindromes(s[1:]) + count_palindromes(s[:-1])
```

4. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic:**

```
def count_palindromes(s):
  count = 0
  for i in range(len(s)):
    count += is_palindrome(s[i:]) % 109 + 7
  return count
```

This implementation of the `count_palindromes` function is incorrect because the result of the modulo operation is not being added to the `count` variable. To fix this, you need to use the following code:

```
def count_palindromes(s):
  count = 0
  for i in range(len(s)):
    count += (is_palindrome(s[i:]) % 109 + 7)
  return count
```

CODEFORCES 592_C. The Big Race

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type to store the input values.** The input values can be very large, so it is important to use the correct data type to store them. For example, using an integer to store a value that is larger than the maximum value of an integer will cause an overflow error.
2. **Using the wrong algorithm to solve the problem.** The problem can be solved using a variety of algorithms, but not all algorithms are efficient. It is important to choose an algorithm that is appropriate for the problem size. For example, a brute-force algorithm would not be efficient for solving this problem.
3. **Making a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm.** Even if the algorithm is correct, a mistake in the implementation could lead to incorrect results. It is important to carefully check the implementation of the algorithm to ensure that it is correct.
4. **Not handling all of the possible cases.** The problem statement may not explicitly state all of the possible cases, but it is important to consider all of the possible cases when solving the problem. For example, the problem statement does not explicitly state that the input values will be non-negative, but it is important to handle this case anyway.
5. **Not testing the solution.** It is important to test the solution to ensure that it is correct. This can be done by testing the solution on a variety of input values.

Title:
CODEFORCES 614_A. Link/Cut Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if the input contains a space between the first two numbers, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation of powers**. The exponentiation operation is not associative, so it is important to calculate the powers in the correct order. For example, if the input is `1 10 2`, the program should print `1 2 4 8`, but if the powers are calculated in the wrong order, the output will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when printing the output. For example, if the output contains a space between two numbers, the program will crash.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. The problem statement does not specify what to do if there are no powers of `k` within the specified range. The program should handle this case gracefully and print `-1`.
5. **Other bugs**. There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the program may crash due to a memory leak, or it may produce incorrect output due to a logic error. It is important to carefully test the program to ensure that it is correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 633_F. The Chocolate Spree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the graph traversal algorithm**

The most common mistake when solving this problem is to incorrectly implement the graph traversal algorithm. This can lead to the algorithm visiting the same vertex multiple times, or missing vertices entirely. To avoid this, it is important to carefully check the algorithm's implementation and make sure that it is correct.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of chocolates**

Once the graph has been traversed, the next step is to calculate the maximum number of chocolates that Alice and Bob can collect. This is done by summing the chocolates at each vertex that is visited by both Alice and Bob. However, it is important to make sure that the chocolates at each vertex are only counted once. To do this, it is necessary to keep track of the vertices that have already been visited by Alice and Bob.

**3. Insufficient memory**

If the graph is large, it may be necessary to use a data structure that can store a large number of vertices and edges. If the data structure is not large enough, the algorithm may run out of memory and crash. To avoid this, it is important to choose a data structure that is appropriate for the size of the graph.

**4. Incorrect input format**

The input for this problem is given in a specific format. If the input is not in the correct format, the algorithm may not be able to correctly solve the problem. It is important to carefully check the input format and make sure that it is correct.

**5. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem is a single integer. If the output is not in the correct format, the judge will not be able to correctly evaluate the solution. It is important to carefully check the output format and make sure that it is correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 662_A. Gambling Nim

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for storing the piles of stones.**

The input specifies that the number of stones in each pile can be up to 10^18. However, the standard integer data type in most programming languages can only store numbers up to 2^31-1. This means that if you try to store the number of stones in a pile using an integer, you will get an overflow error.

To avoid this problem, you can use a larger data type, such as a long integer or a big integer.

**2. Not taking into account the fact that the cards are shuffled.**

The problem states that the players put all the cards on the table, each card only one of its sides up, and this side is chosen independently and uniformly. This means that the probability of any given card being turned up is 1 / 2.

If you do not take this into account, you will get the wrong answer.

**3. Not considering all possible outcomes of the game.**

The problem asks you to find the probability of Petya's victory. To do this, you need to consider all possible outcomes of the game and calculate the probability of each outcome.

This can be a very difficult task, especially if there are a lot of possible outcomes. However, there are a number of techniques that you can use to make this task easier.

One technique is to use a decision tree. A decision tree is a graphical representation of the possible outcomes of a game. By constructing a decision tree, you can visualize the different ways that the game can play out and calculate the probability of each outcome.

Another technique is to use a Monte Carlo simulation. A Monte Carlo simulation is a computer simulation that is used to estimate the probability of an event. By running a Monte Carlo simulation, you can estimate the probability of Petya's victory.

**4. Making a mistake in your calculations.**

When calculating the probability of Petya's victory, it is very easy to make a mistake. One common mistake is to forget to take into account the fact that the cards are shuffled. Another common mistake is to forget to consider all possible outcomes of the game.

To avoid making mistakes in your calculations, it is important to be careful and to double-check your work.

Title:
CODEFORCES 686_D. Kay and Snowflake

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format of the problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the input parser will not be able to correctly parse the input.
2. **Incorrect tree traversal.** The centroid of a tree can be found by recursively traversing the tree and computing the size of each subtree. However, it's important to make sure that you traverse the tree in the correct order. If you traverse the tree in the wrong order, you may not find the correct centroid.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum size of the connected component.** The maximum size of the connected component is the largest number of nodes that can be reached from a single node in the tree. To calculate this value, you need to keep track of the size of each subtree as you traverse the tree.
4. **Incorrect identification of the centroid.** The centroid of a tree is the node whose removal would result in the maximum size of the connected component being at least two times smaller than the size of the initial tree. To identify the centroid, you need to compare the size of each subtree to the maximum size of the connected component.
5. **Incorrect output format.** The output format of the problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when printing the output. For example, if you forget to add a newline character at the end of each line, the output will not be correct.

CODEFORCES 709_C. Letters Cyclic Shift

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the cyclic shift algorithm.** The most common mistake is to forget to wrap around the alphabet when shifting a character past the end of it. For example, if the character `'z'` is shifted, it should be replaced with `'a'`, not `'y'`.
2. **Incorrect handling of empty substrings.** The problem statement specifies that the substring to be shifted must be non-empty, but some solutions may incorrectly shift an empty substring. This will result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect handling of multiple substrings.** The problem statement specifies that only one substring can be shifted, but some solutions may incorrectly shift multiple substrings. This will also result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect handling of the special case where the entire string is shifted.** If the entire string is shifted, the resulting string will be the same as the original string, but in reverse order. Some solutions may not handle this case correctly, resulting in an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect handling of the special case where the string contains only one character.** If the string contains only one character, it cannot be shifted, and the resulting string will be the same as the original string. Some solutions may not handle this case correctly, resulting in an incorrect answer.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement, and to test your solution thoroughly on a variety of input cases.
Test inputs:
```
# Problem: Letters Cyclic Shift

CODEFORCES 730_E. Award Ceremony

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input data. For example, if the input data contains a line with more than two integers, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when writing the output data. For example, if the output data contains a floating-point number instead of an integer, the program will not compile.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program should be correct, otherwise the program will not produce the correct output. For example, if the program does not take into account the fact that the team's score can change after unfreezing, the program will produce an incorrect output.
4. **Memory leaks.** The program should not leak memory, otherwise it will eventually crash. For example, if the program does not free the memory allocated for an array, the program will eventually run out of memory and crash.
5. **Synchronization issues.** If the program is multi-threaded, it is important to synchronize access to shared resources, otherwise the program may produce incorrect results. For example, if two threads try to update the same variable at the same time, the program may produce an incorrect value for the variable.
6. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program should not have any security vulnerabilities, otherwise it may be exploited by attackers. For example, if the program allows users to upload arbitrary files, the program may be used to upload malicious files that can damage the system.

**How to avoid these problems and bugs:**

1. **Use a well-defined input format.** The input format should be strictly defined so that it is easy to parse the input data. For example, the input data can be a list of lists, where each list contains two integers.
2. **Use a well-defined output format.** The output format should be strictly defined so that it is easy to write the output data. For example, the output data can be a list of integers.
3. **Write correct logic.** The logic of the program should be correct, otherwise the program will not produce the correct output. For example, the program should take into account the fact that the team's score can change after unfreezing.
4. **Avoid memory leaks.** The program should not leak memory, otherwise it will eventually crash. For example, the program should free the memory allocated for an array when it is no longer needed.
5. **Avoid synchronization issues.** If the program is multi-threaded, it is important to synchronize access to shared resources, otherwise the program may produce incorrect results. For example, the program should use locks to ensure that only one thread can access a shared variable at a time.
6. **Avoid security vulnerabilities.** The program should not have any security vulnerabilities, otherwise it may be exploited by attackers. For example, the program should not allow users to upload arbitrary files.

CODEFORCES 774_I. Composing Of String

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of strings in the input is not an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect string manipulation**. Strings are a common data type in programming, and it is important to manipulate them correctly. For example, if you try to concatenate two strings that are not of the same length, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be correct in order for it to work properly. For example, if you try to find the minimum number of strings in a set that contain a given substring, but the set does not contain the substring, the program will return an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect error handling**. It is important to handle errors correctly in order to prevent the program from crashing. For example, if the program tries to open a file that does not exist, it should print an error message and exit gracefully.
5. **Incorrect testing**. It is important to test your program thoroughly to ensure that it is working correctly. For example, you should test the program with different input values and make sure that it returns the correct output.

CODEFORCES 79_B. Colorful Field

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The input variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `t` are all integers, but the code uses `float` to store them. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect initialization.** The code initializes the variable `crop` to `0`, but this is incorrect because `crop` should be initialized to an empty list.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The code uses a for loop to iterate over the waste cells, but it does not check if the cell is actually waste. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect output.** The code prints the output in the wrong format. It should print the crop type for each query, followed by a newline character.
5. **Missing error handling.** The code does not handle errors gracefully. If an error occurs, it simply terminates the program.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully check the input and output formats, and make sure that your code is correct. You should also use unit tests to verify that your code is working correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 845_G. Shortest Path Problem?

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data structure**

The input graph is represented as a list of edges. This is not the most efficient data structure for this problem, as it requires O(m) time to find the shortest path between two vertices. A better data structure would be a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)), which allows for O(1) time lookups.

**2. Not handling negative weights correctly**

The problem statement states that the weights of the edges can be negative. However, the bitwise xor operation does not work correctly on negative numbers. This can lead to incorrect results if the weights of the edges are not all positive.

**3. Not handling multiple edges between the same two vertices correctly**

The problem statement states that the graph can contain multiple edges between the same two vertices. However, the bitwise xor operation does not work correctly on duplicate values. This can lead to incorrect results if there are multiple edges between the same two vertices.

**4. Not handling the case where the graph is not connected**

The problem statement states that the graph is connected. However, it is possible to construct a graph that is not connected. This can lead to incorrect results if the graph is not connected.

**5. Not handling the case where the shortest path does not exist**

The problem statement states that there is a shortest path between vertices 1 and n. However, it is possible to construct a graph where there is no shortest path between two vertices. This can lead to incorrect results if the shortest path does not exist.

**6. Not handling the case where the shortest path is not unique**

The problem statement states that there is a unique shortest path between vertices 1 and n. However, it is possible to construct a graph where there is more than one shortest path between two vertices. This can lead to incorrect results if the shortest path is not unique.

CODEFORCES 914_D. Bash and a Tough Math Puzzle

Pain points:
```
# Problem: https://codeforces.com/contest/914/problem/D
# Solution:

n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
q = int(input())

gcd_arr = [arr[0]]
for i in range(1, n):
    gcd_arr.append(gcd(gcd_arr[-1], arr[i]))

for _ in range(q):
    q_type = int(input())

        arr[l-1] = x
        gcd_arr.pop()
        gcd_arr.append(gcd(gcd_arr[-1], x))
```

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrect use of `gcd()` function.** The `gcd()` function takes two arguments and returns their greatest common divisor. In this problem, the developer may incorrectly use the `gcd()` function to find the greatest common divisor of more than two numbers. This would result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect use of `list()` function.** The `list()` function creates a new list from a given iterable. In this problem, the developer may incorrectly use the `list()` function to create a list of numbers from a string. This would result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect use of `pop()` function.** The `pop()` function removes the last element from a list. In this problem, the developer may incorrectly use the `pop()` function to remove an element from the middle of a list. This would result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect use of `%` operator.** The `%` operator returns the remainder of a division operation. In this problem, the developer may incorrectly use the `%` operator to check if two numbers are divisible by each other. This would result in an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect use of `if` statement.** The `if` statement checks if a condition is true and executes the code block if it is. In this problem, the developer may incorrectly use the `if` statement to check if two numbers are equal. This would result in an incorrect answer.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements. It is also important to test your code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct.

CODEFORCES 98_E. Help Shrek and Donkey

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the game rules.** The player who guesses the card on the table wins, not the player who makes the last move.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the probability of winning.** The probability of winning is not simply the number of winning moves divided by the total number of moves. The probability of winning depends on the order in which the players make their moves.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the number of winning moves or the total number of moves, it is easy to make a mistake and count one move too many or too few.
4. **Floating-point errors.** When calculating the probability of winning, it is important to use the correct floating-point arithmetic. Using the wrong rounding mode or using an incorrect number of significant digits can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Memory errors.** If the game is implemented using a recursive algorithm, it is important to ensure that the recursion stack does not overflow.
6. **Time complexity.** The algorithm for solving this problem should be efficient. A naive algorithm that simply enumerates all possible game states will have a time complexity of O(2^(m+n)), which is too slow for large values of m and n. A more efficient algorithm can be used to solve the problem in O(m+n).

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect variable type**. The variables used in the program must be of the correct type. For example, if a variable is declared as an integer, but a string is assigned to it, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be correct. For example, if the program is supposed to find the minimum value of a set of numbers, but it instead finds the maximum value, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the program misses or adds one element when iterating over a list or array. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output.
5. **Infinite loops**. Infinite loops occur when the program enters a loop that never terminates. This can happen if the loop condition is always true, or if the loop body contains a recursive function call. Infinite loops can cause the program to crash or run out of memory.
6. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when the program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
7. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same shared resource at the same time. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output or crash.
8. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, but neither thread can do so. This can cause the program to be stuck in a permanent state.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain an integer t, which is the number of test cases. However, if the input contains fewer than t test cases, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the winner's name and the total sum of points should be printed on a single line, separated by a space. However, if the output does not follow this format, the program will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The game is played by two players, Joey and Chandler. Joey always moves first, and Chandler always moves second. The game ends when neither player has a valid move. The winner is the player who has the most points. However, if both players have the same number of points, the game is a tie.
4. **Memory leaks.** The program should not allocate any memory that it does not need. If the program allocates memory that it does not need, it will eventually run out of memory and crash.
5. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program should not allow any malicious input that could be used to exploit security vulnerabilities.

HACKEREARTH digit

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect type conversion.** The problem states that the input values are positive integers, but the code may incorrectly convert them to strings or floating-point numbers. This can lead to errors in the calculation of the sum of digits or the divisibility check.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** The problem states that the numbers from A to B are divisible by K, but the code may incorrectly check for divisibility by K-1 or K+1. This can lead to errors in the output.
3. **Incorrect boundary conditions.** The problem states that A ≤ B, but the code may incorrectly check for A > B. This can lead to errors in the calculation of the number of numbers that are divisible by K.
4. **Infinite loops.** The problem states that the input values are positive integers, but the code may incorrectly allow negative or zero values. This can lead to infinite loops in the calculation of the sum of digits or the divisibility check.
5. **Memory errors.** The problem states that the input values are small enough to fit in memory, but the code may incorrectly allocate too much memory. This can lead to memory errors or crashes.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the constraints. The code should be carefully written to avoid incorrect type conversions, off-by-one errors, incorrect boundary conditions, infinite loops, and memory errors.

Title:
HACKEREARTH monk-in-the-real-estate

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data is a list of roads, which are represented by pairs of integers. If the developer uses the wrong data type to store the roads, it may cause incorrect results. For example, if the developer uses strings to store the roads, it will not be able to correctly compare the roads and determine if they are the same.

**2. Not handling invalid input**

The input data may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers that are too large. If the developer does not handle invalid input correctly, it may cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect results. For example, if the developer tries to divide by zero, it will cause the program to crash.

**3. Not using the correct algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a variety of algorithms. The developer must choose the correct algorithm for the problem, or it may not be able to solve the problem correctly or efficiently. For example, if the developer uses a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem, it may take a very long time to run.

**4. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and that it handles all possible cases. If the developer does not test the code, it may contain bugs that will not be discovered until it is deployed in production. For example, if the developer does not test the code with invalid input, it may not be able to handle invalid input correctly.

Title:
HACKEREARTH place-value-and-primes

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable types**. The input is a string, but the code tries to convert it to an integer. This will cause a ValueError.
2. **Incorrect loop conditions**. The code uses a for loop to iterate over the digits of the number, but the loop condition is incorrect. This will cause the loop to iterate over the same digit multiple times.
3. **Incorrect calculations**. The code calculates the place value of the digit incorrectly. This will cause the wrong prime number to be printed.
4. **Incorrect output**. The code prints the prime number as a string, but the output should be an integer.

To fix these problems, you can do the following:

1. Use the `int()` function to convert the input to an integer.
2. Use the `range()` function to iterate over the digits of the number.
3. Use the `pow()` function to calculate the place value of the digit.
4. Use the `is_prime()` function to check if the number is prime.
5. Print the prime number as an integer.

Here is an example of code that fixes these problems:

```python
def main():
    # Get the input.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        # Get the number and the digit.
        n, m, x = input().split()
        n = int(n)
        m = int(m)
        x = int(x)

        # Calculate the place value of the digit.
        place_value = n // (10 ** (x - 1)) % 10

        # Check if the number is prime.
        if place_value % 2 == 0:
            print(f"{place_value}th prime number: {2}")
        else:
            print(f"{place_value}th prime number: {place_value + 1}")

Title:
HACKEREARTH roy-and-texting-robot-2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of key presses.** The problem statement states that "To type "b", we need to press "2" twice. To type "?" we need to press "1" thrice. To type "5" we need to press "5" four times. To type "0" we need to press "0" twice." However, some developers may incorrectly count the number of key presses, for example, they may count "b" as 3 key presses instead of 2.
2. **Incorrectly counting the number of movements between keys.** The problem statement states that "It takes 1 second to move from one key to another." However, some developers may incorrectly count the number of movements between keys, for example, they may count the movement between "1" and "2" as 2 instead of 1.
3. **Incorrectly handling keys that are not on the keypad.** The problem statement states that the keypad only contains the characters ".", ",", "?", "!", [a-z], "_", and [0-9]. However, some developers may incorrectly handle keys that are not on the keypad, for example, they may try to type the letter "ñ".
4. **Incorrectly handling strings that contain multiple words.** The problem statement states that the messages Roy needs to send are strings. However, some developers may incorrectly handle strings that contain multiple words, for example, they may try to type the string "two words" as two separate strings, "two" and "words".
5. **Incorrectly handling strings that contain special characters.** The problem statement states that the messages Roy needs to send are strings. However, some developers may incorrectly handle strings that contain special characters, for example, they may try to type the string "123!@#$%^&*()_+-=" as a single string.

Title:
HACKEREARTH substring

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of `strchr()` function.** The `strchr()` function returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the specified character in the string. If the character is not found, the function returns `NULL`. In this problem, the developer used `strchr()` to check if a character is in the string, but they did not check if the return value of `strchr()` was `NULL`. This could lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect use of `strlen()` function.** The `strlen()` function returns the length of a string. In this problem, the developer used `strlen()` to calculate the number of characters in the string, but they did not subtract 1 from the return value of `strlen()`. This could lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect use of `for` loop.** The developer used a `for` loop to iterate over the characters in the string, but they did not initialize the loop variable. This could lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect use of `if` statement.** The developer used an `if` statement to check if a character is in the string, but they did not use the correct comparison operator. This could lead to incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect use of `&&` operator.** The developer used the `&&` operator to combine two conditions, but they did not use parentheses to group the conditions. This could lead to incorrect results.
6. **Incorrect use of `||` operator.** The developer used the `||` operator to combine two conditions, but they did not use parentheses to group the conditions. This could lead to incorrect results.
7. **Incorrect use of `++` operator.** The developer used the `++` operator to increment a variable, but they did not use parentheses to group the expression. This could lead to incorrect results.
8. **Incorrect use of `--` operator.** The developer used the `--` operator to decrement a variable, but they did not use parentheses to group the expression. This could lead to incorrect results.
9. **Incorrect use of `return` statement.** The developer used the `return` statement to return a value from a function, but they did not include a return value. This could lead to incorrect results.
10. **Incorrect use of `break` statement.** The developer used the `break` statement to break out of a loop, but they did not use the `break` statement inside the loop body. This could lead to incorrect results.

Title:
HACKEREARTH vasya-and-party

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect modular arithmetic**

When performing modular arithmetic, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct modulus. In this problem, the modulus is 10^9+7. This means that any number that is greater than or equal to 10^9+7 will wrap around to 0. For example, 10^10 mod 10^9+7 is equal to 0. This can lead to incorrect results if you are not careful.

**2. Incorrect use of the Sieve of Eratosthenes**

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a very efficient algorithm for finding all of the prime numbers up to a given limit. However, it is important to use the algorithm correctly. In this problem, the Sieve of Eratosthenes is used to find all of the prime numbers less than or equal to the maximum knowledge level of any person at the party. However, the algorithm is only guaranteed to find all of the prime numbers up to the square root of the maximum knowledge level. This means that some of the prime numbers that are needed to solve the problem may not be found by the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

**3. Incorrect use of the Chinese remainder theorem**

The Chinese remainder theorem is a powerful tool for solving systems of congruences. However, it is important to use the theorem correctly. In this problem, the Chinese remainder theorem is used to find the number of ways to choose a leader for each group of friends. However, the theorem is only guaranteed to work if the moduli are pairwise coprime. This means that the moduli cannot have any common factors other than 1. In this problem, the moduli are the knowledge levels of the people at the party. It is possible that some of these knowledge levels may have common factors. If this is the case, the Chinese remainder theorem will not work correctly.

**4. Incorrect use of the inclusion-exclusion principle**

The inclusion-exclusion principle is a powerful tool for counting the number of elements in a set. However, it is important to use the principle correctly. In this problem, the inclusion-exclusion principle is used to count the number of ways to choose a leader for each group of friends. However, the principle is only guaranteed to work if the sets are disjoint. This means that no element can be in more than one set. In this problem, the sets are the groups of friends. It is possible that some people may be in more than one group. If this is the case, the inclusion-exclusion principle will not work correctly.

Title:
ATCODER p03148 AtCoder Beginner Contest 116 - Various Sushi

Pain points:
**1. Not handling the case where K > N correctly.**

The problem states that `1 <= K <= N`, but some solutions will incorrectly return an error if `K > N`. This can be fixed by checking that `K <= N` before running the main algorithm.

**2. Not handling the case where there are no sushi pieces with a given topping.**

The problem states that `1 <= t_i <= N`, but some solutions will incorrectly assume that there is always at least one sushi piece with each topping. This can be fixed by checking that `t_i <= N` for each sushi piece before adding it to the list of sushi pieces to eat.

**3. Not using the most efficient data structure to store the sushi pieces.**

The problem states that `1 <= N <= 10^5`, so it is possible to have a large number of sushi pieces. Some solutions will use a data structure that is not efficient for storing a large number of elements, such as a list. This can lead to slow runtimes. A more efficient data structure to use would be a hash table, which allows for fast lookups of sushi pieces by their topping.

**4. Not using the most efficient algorithm to find the maximum satisfaction.**

The problem states that `K <= N`, so it is possible to find the maximum satisfaction by simply iterating over all possible subsets of the sushi pieces and choosing the subset that has the highest total deliciousness and variety bonus. However, this algorithm has a time complexity of `O(2^N)`, which can be prohibitively slow for large values of N. A more efficient algorithm would be to use dynamic programming, which has a time complexity of `O(N^2)`.

**5. Not handling the edge cases correctly.**

The problem has a few edge cases that some solutions may not handle correctly. For example, the problem states that `1 <= t_i <= N`, but it is possible for `t_i` to be equal to 0. Some solutions will incorrectly assume that `t_i` must be greater than 0, which will lead to an error. Another edge case is the case where `K = 1`. Some solutions will incorrectly assume that `K` must be greater than 1, which will lead to an incorrect answer.

ATCODER p03292 AtCoder Beginner Contest 103 - Task Scheduling Problem

Pain points:
**1. Not handling the case where all 3 numbers are equal**

If all 3 numbers are equal, then the optimal solution is to complete all 3 tasks at cost 0. However, some solutions may not handle this case correctly and output a wrong answer.

**2. Not handling the case where 2 numbers are equal**

If 2 of the numbers are equal, then the optimal solution is to complete the 3rd task first, then the 2 equal tasks. However, some solutions may not handle this case correctly and output a wrong answer.

**3. Not handling the case where the numbers are in increasing or decreasing order**

If the numbers are in increasing or decreasing order, then the optimal solution is to complete the tasks in the same order. However, some solutions may not handle this case correctly and output a wrong answer.

**4. Using incorrect algorithms**

Some solutions may use incorrect algorithms to solve the problem, which can lead to wrong answers. For example, some solutions may use a brute force approach, which can be very inefficient.

**5. Using incorrect data structures**

Some solutions may use incorrect data structures to store the data, which can lead to inefficient algorithms and wrong answers. For example, some solutions may use a linked list to store the data, which can be very inefficient for this problem.

**6. Not handling errors correctly**

Some solutions may not handle errors correctly, which can lead to incorrect answers or crashes. For example, some solutions may not check if the input is valid, which can lead to incorrect answers.

ATCODER p03769 AtCoder Grand Contest 012 - Tautonym Puzzle

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is `N`, where `N` is an integer. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is `|s|`, the length of `s`, followed by the elements of `s` in order, with spaces in between. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly produce the output and will produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect calculation of `|s|`**. The value of `|s|` must be between 1 and 200. If the value of `|s|` is outside of this range, the program will not be able to correctly calculate the value of `|s|` and will produce incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the elements of `s`**. The elements of `s` must be integers between 1 and 100. If any of the elements of `s` is outside of this range, the program will not be able to correctly calculate the elements of `s` and will produce incorrect output.
5. **Incorrect calculation of the number of good subsequences of `s`**. The number of good subsequences of `s` must be exactly `N`. If the number of good subsequences of `s` is not equal to `N`, the program will not be able to correctly calculate the number of good subsequences of `s` and will produce incorrect output.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format, output format, and calculation of `|s|`, the elements of `s`, and the number of good subsequences of `s`.

Title:
AIZU p00030 Sum of Integers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 9) and s (0 ≤ s ≤ 100) separated by a single space. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The number of combinations that add up to s can be calculated using the following formula:

```
C(n, k) = n! / k!(n - k)!
```

where n is the number of integers and k is the sum of the integers. If the calculation is incorrect, the program will output the wrong answer.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When calculating the number of combinations, it is important to make sure that the indices of the integers are correct. If an off-by-one error occurs, the program will output the wrong answer.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program should be careful not to allocate too much memory, as this can lead to a memory leak.
5. **Race conditions**. If multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is important to ensure that the data is accessed in a thread-safe manner. If a race condition occurs, the program may produce incorrect results.

Title:
AIZU p00488 Lunch

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is a list of integers, but the developer may accidentally treat it as a list of strings. This will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The program needs to find the minimum price of the set menu, which is the total price of pasta and juice minus 50 yen. The developer may accidentally calculate the total price of pasta and juice incorrectly, or may forget to subtract 50 yen. This will cause the program to output an incorrect answer.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The program needs to find the minimum price of the set menu, which means that it needs to find the smallest element in the list of prices. The developer may accidentally iterate over the list of prices one element too many or one element too few, which will cause the program to output an incorrect answer.
4. **Infinite loop**. The program may enter an infinite loop if it does not properly check for the end of the list of prices. This can happen if the developer forgets to check the `len()` function of the list of prices, or if the developer uses an infinite loop to iterate over the list of prices.
5. **Memory leak**. The program may leak memory if it does not properly free the memory allocated for the list of prices. This can happen if the developer forgets to call the `del()` function on the list of prices, or if the developer uses a garbage collection system that does not properly free memory.

Title:
AIZU p01081 Char Swap

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of operations needed.** The most common mistake is to count the number of operations needed to make the string a palindrome from the left side and the right side separately, and then add the two numbers together. However, this is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that some operations may cancel each other out. For example, if the string is "abba", then swapping the first two letters and the last two letters will result in a palindrome, but counting the number of operations needed from each side separately would give an answer of 2 + 2 = 4.
2. **Not considering the case where the string is not a palindrome.** If the string is not a palindrome, then it is not possible to make it a palindrome by swapping adjacent characters. In this case, the correct answer is -1.
3. **Using a brute-force approach.** A brute-force approach to this problem would be to try every possible combination of swaps and see if any of them results in a palindrome. This approach is inefficient and will not work for large strings.
4. **Using a recursive approach.** A recursive approach to this problem can be very inefficient, especially for large strings. This is because the recursive function will be called multiple times on the same subproblems, which can lead to a lot of wasted computation.
5. **Using an incorrect data structure.** The data structure used to store the string can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. For example, using a linked list to store the string will be much slower than using a vector.
6. **Not using the right algorithm.** The best algorithm for solving this problem is the Karp-Rabin algorithm. This algorithm is very efficient and can be used to solve the problem in O(n) time.

Title:
AIZU p01533 Acrophobia

Pain points:
**1. Input format errors**

The input format of the problem is not standard. The input format is as follows:

```
W H
S.M
...
...
M.G
```

where `W` and `H` are the width and height of the room, respectively, and `S.M` is the starting position of Yayoi. However, the input format of the example is as follows:

```
3 4
S.M
...
...
M.G
```

The input format of the example is missing the first line, which specifies the width and height of the room. This will cause the program to crash.

**2. Incorrect use of variables**

The problem states that the starting position of Yayoi is `S.M`. However, the example program uses the variable `S` to store the starting position of Yayoi. This will cause the program to output the wrong answer.

**3. Incorrect use of functions**

The problem states that the time it takes to move to the next tile is 1 second. However, the example program uses the function `time()` to calculate the time it takes to move to the next tile. This will cause the program to output the wrong answer.

**4. Incorrect use of loops**

The problem states that Yayoi can move to the top, bottom, left, and right tiles. However, the example program uses a `for` loop to iterate over all of the tiles in the room. This will cause the program to output the wrong answer.

**5. Incorrect use of conditions**

The problem states that Yayoi will be scared if she is close to a hole. However, the example program does not check if Yayoi is close to a hole. This will cause the program to output the wrong answer.

Title:
AIZU p01968 Hierarchical Calculator

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect variable type**

The problem statement mentions that the input is a list of integers. However, the code below incorrectly reads the input as a list of strings. This will cause errors when the code tries to perform arithmetic operations on the input.

```
N = int(input())
a = list(map(str, input().split()))
```

**2. Incorrect logic**

The problem statement states that the output should be a list of integers. However, the code below incorrectly outputs a list of strings. This will cause errors when the code is run.

```
for i in range(N):
    print(a[i])
```

**3. Missing error handling**

The problem statement does not specify what should happen if the input is invalid. The code below does not handle invalid input gracefully. If the input is invalid, the code will crash.

```
try:
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(str, input().split()))
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input")
```

**4. Inefficient code**

The code below is inefficient because it uses a nested loop to iterate over the input list. This can be improved by using a list comprehension.

```
for i in range(N):
    for j in range(N):
        print(a[i] + a[j])
```

**5. Unclear code**

The code below is unclear because it does not use descriptive variable names. This makes it difficult to understand what the code is doing.

```
N = int(input())
a = list(map(str, input().split()))
for i in range(N):
    for j in range(N):
        print(a[i] + a[j])
```

**6. Redundant code**

The code below contains redundant code. The first two lines of code could be combined into one line.

```
N = int(input())
a = list(map(str, input().split()))
```

**7. Unnecessary code**

The code below contains unnecessary code. The `try` and `except` blocks could be removed because the code does not handle invalid input.

Title:
AIZU p02255 Insertion Sort

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one errors.** The most common mistake when implementing an algorithm is to make an off-by-one error. This means that you accidentally increment or decrement an index by one too many or one too few. In this problem, it is important to be careful about the indices of the elements in the array as you iterate through them.
2. **Incorrect logic.** Another common mistake is to implement the algorithm incorrectly. This could be due to a misunderstanding of the algorithm, or a mistake in the coding. In this problem, it is important to understand the steps of the insertion sort algorithm and to implement them correctly.
3. **Incorrect output format.** The output format for this problem is very specific. You must output the intermediate sequence in a line for each step. The elements of the sequence should be separated by a single space. Make sure that your output matches the expected format.
4. **Runtime errors.** If your code is not running correctly, it could be due to a runtime error. This could be caused by a number of things, such as a division by zero error, an array out-of-bounds error, or a stack overflow error. Make sure that your code is free of runtime errors.
5. **Memory leaks.** If your code is using up too much memory, it could be due to a memory leak. This means that your code is allocating memory that it is not freeing up. Make sure that your code is free of memory leaks.

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is two integers separated by a single space. If the input format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of rows and columns**. The number of rows and columns of the rectangle is determined by the values of `H` and `W`. If the calculation is incorrect, the program may produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect printing of the rectangle**. The rectangle should be printed using the character `#`. If the character is incorrect, the program may produce incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect indentation**. The code should be properly indented to make it easy to read and understand. If the indentation is incorrect, the program may be difficult to debug.
5. **Incorrect use of variables**. The variables `h` and `w` should be used to store the height and width of the rectangle, respectively. If the variables are used incorrectly, the program may produce incorrect output.
6. **Incorrect use of loops**. The program should use a loop to print the rows of the rectangle. If the loop is incorrect, the program may produce incorrect output.
7. **Incorrect use of functions**. The program should use a function to print the rectangle. If the function is incorrect, the program may produce incorrect output.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. The code should be properly indented and the variables should be used correctly. The program should use loops and functions correctly to produce the correct output.
