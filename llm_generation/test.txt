CODEFORCES 1575_A. Another Sorting Problem

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect comparison of strings

The most common bug is to compare strings incorrectly. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
def compare_strings(s1, s2):
  for i in range(len(s1)):
    if s1[i] < s2[i]:
      return -1
    elif s1[i] > s2[i]:
      return 1
  return 0

```

This code would compare the strings lexicographically, which is not what is required for the asc-desc-ending order. To correctly compare strings, we need to first check if the strings are of the same length. If they are not, then the shorter string should come first. If they are the same length, then we need to compare the characters in the odd-indexed positions first, and then the characters in the even-indexed positions.

### 2. Incorrect handling of ties

Another common bug is to incorrectly handle ties. For example, the following code would not work correctly if two strings have the same first character:

```
def compare_strings(s1, s2):
  for i in range(len(s1)):
    if s1[i] < s2[i]:
      return -1
    elif s1[i] > s2[i]:
      return 1
  return 0

```

To correctly handle ties, we need to keep track of the number of ties that have occurred so far. If the number of ties is even, then the shorter string should come first. If the number of ties is odd, then the longer string should come first.

### 3. Incorrect use of the sort function

The sort function can be used to sort a list of strings in ascending or descending order. However, it is important to use the correct comparison function when sorting the strings. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
strings = ["AA", "AB", "BB", "BA", "AZ"]

sorted_strings = sorted(strings)

print(sorted_strings)
```

The output of this code would be `['AA', 'AB', 'BB', 'BA', 'AZ']`, which is not the asc-desc-ending order. To correctly sort the strings, we need to use the following comparison function:

```
def compare_strings(s1, s2):
  for i in range(len(s1)):
    if s1[i] < s2[i]:
      return -1
    elif s1[i] > s2[i]:
      return 1
  return 0

```

### 4. Incorrect use of the index function

The index function can be used to find the position of a particular element in a list. However, it is important to use the correct index when using the asc-desc-ending order. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
strings = ["AA", "AB", "BB", "BA", "AZ"]

sorted_strings = sorted(strings)

print(sorted_strings[0])
```

The output of this code would be `'AA'`, which is not the first element in the asc-desc-ending order. To correctly find the first element in the asc-desc-ending order, we need to use the following code:

```
strings = ["AA", "AB", "BB", "BA", "AZ"]

sorted_strings = sorted(strings)

print(sorted_strings[-1])
```

### 5. Incorrect use of the slicing operator

The slicing operator can be used to extract a substring from a string. However, it is important to use the correct slicing operator when using the asc-desc-ending order. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
strings = ["AA", "AB", "BB", "BA", "AZ"]

sorted_strings = sorted(strings)

print(sorted_strings[0][0])
```

The output of this code would be `'A'`, which is not the first character in the asc-desc-ending order. To correctly extract the first character in the asc-desc-ending order, we need to use the following code:

```
strings = ["AA", "AB", "BB", "BA", "AZ"]

sorted_strings = sorted(strings)

CODEFORCES 1575_B. Building an Amusement Park

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of math functions.** The problem requires the output to be a real number, so you need to make sure that you are using the correct math functions. For example, you should use `math.sqrt()` to calculate the square root of a number, and not `pow()`.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** Be careful when indexing into arrays or lists. It is easy to make a mistake and accidentally access an element that is one index off from the one you intended.
3. **Incorrect use of comparison operators.** Make sure you are using the correct comparison operators for the data types you are comparing. For example, you should use `==` to compare two integers, and `!=` to compare two strings.
4. **Incorrect use of logical operators.** Be careful when using logical operators such as `and` and `or`. Make sure you understand how they work and that you are using them correctly.
5. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.** Floating-point numbers can be tricky to work with, so it is important to be careful when using them. For example, you should always round floating-point numbers to the desired precision before comparing them.
6. **Memory leaks.** Make sure you are releasing any memory that you allocate during your program. If you do not release memory, your program may eventually run out of memory and crash.
7. **Infinite loops.** Make sure your program does not enter an infinite loop. An infinite loop is a loop that never terminates, and it can cause your program to freeze or crash.
8. **Incorrect error handling.** Make sure your program handles errors correctly. If an error occurs, your program should print an error message and exit gracefully.
9. **Security vulnerabilities.** Make sure your program is secure. For example, you should not allow users to input arbitrary data into your program, and you should always validate user input.
10. **Bad design.** Make sure your program is well-designed. A well-designed program is easy to read, understand, and maintain.

**Possible problems and bugs:**

1. The input format is not specified clearly. For example, it is not clear whether the first line contains n, m, and k, or n and k.
2. The output format is not specified clearly. For example, it is not clear whether the output should be a single integer or a list of integers.
3. The code does not handle the case where k is not a prime number.
4. The code does not handle the case where the sum of the elements in a segment is not divisible by k.
5. The code does not handle the case where there are no segments in b where the sum of the elements is divisible by k.
6. The code does not handle the case where the input is invalid.

**Possible solutions:**

1. The input format can be specified more clearly by using a separate line for each of n, m, and k.
2. The output format can be specified more clearly by using a single line for the output.
3. The code can be modified to handle the case where k is not a prime number by using a different algorithm.
4. The code can be modified to handle the case where the sum of the elements in a segment is not divisible by k by using a different algorithm.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1575_D. Divisible by Twenty-Five

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of possible digits that can replace the `_` character.** The number of possible digits that can replace the `_` character is not always equal to 10. For example, if the input string contains two consecutive `_` characters, then the only possible digit that can replace both of them is `0`.
2. **Incorrectly counting the number of possible digits that can replace the `X` character.** The number of possible digits that can replace the `X` character is not always equal to 9. For example, if the input string contains two consecutive `X` characters, then the only possible digit that can replace both of them is `5`.
3. **Incorrectly handling leading zeroes.** A leading zero is any 0 digit that comes before the first nonzero digit in a number string. For example, the string `0025` has two leading zeroes. However, the string `0` does not have any leading zeroes.
4. **Incorrectly handling non-leading zeroes.** A non-leading zero is any 0 digit that does not come before the first nonzero digit in a number string. For example, the string `250` has one non-leading zero.
5. **Incorrectly handling the case where the input string is empty.** The input string could be empty, in which case the output should be 0.
6. **Incorrectly handling the case where the input string contains only one digit.** The input string could contain only one digit, in which case the output should be 1.
7. **Incorrectly handling the case where the input string contains only two digits.** The input string could contain only two digits, in which case the output should be 2.
8. **Incorrectly handling the case where the input string contains only three digits.** The input string could contain only three digits, in which case the output should be 3.
9. **Incorrectly handling the case where the input string contains only four digits.** The input string could contain only four digits, in which case the output should be 4.
10. **Incorrectly handling the case where the input string contains only five digits.** The input string could contain only five digits, in which case the output should be 5.
11. **Incorrectly handling the case where the input string contains only six digits.** The input string could contain only six digits, in which case the output should be 6.
12. **Incorrectly handling the case where the input string contains only seven digits.** The input string could contain only seven digits, in which case the output should be 7.
13. **Incorrectly handling the case where the input string contains only eight digits.** The input string could contain only eight digits, in which case the output should be 8.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1575_E. Eye-Pleasing City Park Tour

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.** The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that computes the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. It is often used to solve problems in graph theory and computer science.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is to use an incorrect initialization for the distance matrix. The distance matrix should be initialized to `INF` (infinity) for all pairs of vertices that are not connected by an edge. However, some developers initialize the distance matrix to `0` for all pairs of vertices, which will lead to incorrect results.

2. **Using an incorrect data structure for the graph.** The Floyd-Warshall algorithm works by iteratively updating the distance matrix until it converges to the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices. The time complexity of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is O(V^3), where V is the number of vertices in the graph.

One common mistake that developers make when using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is to use an incorrect data structure for the graph. For example, using a linked list to represent the graph will result in a time complexity of O(V^4), which is much slower than the O(V^3) time complexity of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

3. **Using an incorrect modulo operation.** The Floyd-Warshall algorithm often uses modulo operations to ensure that the distance matrix does not overflow. However, some developers use an incorrect modulo operation, which can lead to incorrect results.

The correct modulo operation for the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is `(a + b) % MOD`, where `a` and `b` are integers and `MOD` is the modulus. Some developers mistakenly use the modulo operation `a % MOD + b % MOD`, which can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Using an incorrect pruning condition.** The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can be pruned to reduce the number of iterations required. One common pruning condition is to check if the distance between two vertices is greater than the shortest path length found so far. However, some developers use an incorrect pruning condition, which can lead to incorrect results.

The correct pruning condition for the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is to check if the distance between two vertices is greater than the shortest path length found so far plus the weight of the edge between the two vertices. Some developers mistakenly check if the distance between two vertices is greater than the shortest path length found so far, which can lead to incorrect results.

5. **Not handling negative weights correctly.** The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can handle negative weights, but some developers do not handle them correctly. Negative weights can lead to negative-weight cycles, which can cause the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to diverge.

To handle negative weights correctly, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm must first detect and remove all negative-weight cycles. Once all negative-weight cycles have been removed, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm can be used to compute the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.

* The input format is not specified.
* The output format is not specified.
* The problem statement is not clear.
* The code is not efficient.
* The code has bugs.

Here are some specific examples of problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* The input format is not specified. The developer may assume that the input format is one of the following:
    * ```
    n, k
    a_1, a_2, ..., a_n
    ```
    * ```
    n

    k
    ```
    * ```
    k
    a_1, a_2, ..., a_n
    n
    ```
    However, the actual input format is ```
    n, k
    a_1, a_2, ..., a_n
    ```
* The output format is not specified. The developer may assume that the output format is one of the following:
    * ```
    f(a)
    ```
    * ```
    f(a) % 10^9 + 7
    ```
    * ```
    p * q^{-1} % 10^9 + 7
    ```
    However, the actual output format is ```
    p * q^{-1} % 10^9 + 7
    ```
* The problem statement is not clear. The developer may not understand what the problem is asking. For example, the problem statement does not specify what ```f(b)``` is.
* The code is not efficient. The developer may use an inefficient algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the developer may use a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem.
* The code has bugs. The developer may make mistakes when writing the code. For example, the developer may use the wrong variable name or the wrong operator.

CODEFORCES 1575_M. Managing Telephone Poles

Pain points:
**1. ** **Incorrect use of mathematical operators.** One common mistake is to use the wrong mathematical operator. For example, you might accidentally use `+` instead of `*` when computing the distance between two points. This would result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** Another common mistake is to forget to add or subtract one when computing the indices of a grid. For example, you might accidentally compute the distance between the point (0, 0) and the point (1, 1) as `(1 - 0)^2 + (1 - 0)^2 = 2`, when the correct answer is `(2 - 0)^2 + (1 - 0)^2 = 5`.
3. **Incorrect use of array indices.** It is important to be careful when using array indices, as they can easily be off by one. For example, you might accidentally try to access the element at index `n` of an array that only has `n - 1` elements. This would result in an error.
4. **Memory errors.** It is important to be careful not to allocate too much memory, as this can lead to your program running out of memory. For example, you might accidentally create an array that is larger than the amount of memory available on your system. This would result in a segmentation fault.
5. **Infinite loops.** It is important to be careful not to create infinite loops in your code. For example, you might accidentally create a loop that never terminates. This would result in your program running forever.
6. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.** Floating-point numbers are not always precise, and this can lead to errors in your calculations. For example, you might accidentally round a number to the wrong number of decimal places. This would result in an incorrect answer.
7. **Incorrect use of Boolean logic.** Boolean logic can be tricky, and it is important to be careful when using it. For example, you might accidentally use the `&&` operator instead of the `||` operator. This would result in an incorrect answer.
8. **Incorrect use of exceptions.** Exceptions can be a useful way to handle errors in your code, but it is important to use them correctly. For example, you might accidentally catch an exception that you didn't throw. This would result in your program not handling the error correctly.
9. **Incorrect use of threads.** Threads can be a powerful tool, but it is important to use them correctly. For example, you might accidentally create a thread that never terminates. This would result in your program running forever.
10. **Incorrect use of mutexes.** Mutexes are a way to prevent multiple threads from accessing the same data at the same time. However, it is important to use them correctly. For example, you might accidentally use a mutex that is not locked. This would result in your program accessing data that has been corrupted by another thread.

CODEFORCES 1579_B. Shifting Sort

Pain points:
Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem statement is quite long and detailed, so it is important to read it carefully and make sure that you understand all of the requirements. One common mistake is to assume that the array must be sorted in ascending order. However, the problem statement only requires that the array be sorted in some order, so it is possible to sort the array in descending order or even in a random order.
* **Incorrect implementation of the sorting algorithm.** There are many different sorting algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. Some of the most common algorithms include bubble sort, selection sort, and merge sort. Each algorithm has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it is important to choose the algorithm that is best suited for the given problem. Another common mistake is to implement the sorting algorithm incorrectly. This can lead to the array not being sorted correctly or to the algorithm taking a long time to run.
* **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement specifies a few edge cases that must be handled correctly. For example, the array may be empty or it may contain duplicate elements. It is important to make sure that the sorting algorithm handles these edge cases correctly.
* **Incorrect testing.** It is important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. This can be done by creating a variety of test cases, both simple and complex. The test cases should cover all of the possible edge cases that were identified in the previous step.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1579_E2. Array Optimization by Deque

Pain points:
### Possible problems and bugs

1. **Incorrect implementation of the deque data structure.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. The deque should support adding elements to both the beginning and the end, and it should also support removing elements from both the beginning and the end. Make sure that your implementation of the deque meets these requirements.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of inversions.** The number of inversions in a deque is the number of pairs of elements $(i, j)$ such that $i < j$ and $d_i > d_j$, where $d_i$ is the element at index $i$ in the deque. Make sure that you are correctly calculating this number.
3. **Incorrect handling of duplicate elements in the array.** The problem statement states that the array may contain duplicate elements. Make sure that your algorithm correctly handles duplicate elements.
4. **Incorrect handling of the edge cases.** The problem statement specifies a few edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with only one element. Make sure that your algorithm correctly handles these edge cases.
5. **Runtime errors.** Make sure that your algorithm runs in time $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the array.
6. **Memory errors.** Make sure that your algorithm does not use more memory than necessary.

### Tips for avoiding these problems

1. **Test your code thoroughly.** This is the best way to catch errors in your code. Make sure to test your code on a variety of input data, including both small and large arrays, arrays with duplicate elements, and arrays with edge cases.
2. **Use a good deque implementation.** There are many different deque implementations available, so choose one that is well-tested and efficient.
3. **Use a good algorithm for calculating the number of inversions.** There are many different algorithms for calculating the number of inversions in a deque. Choose one that is efficient and easy to implement.
4. **Be careful when handling duplicate elements in the array.** Duplicate elements can cause problems for some algorithms, so make sure that you are aware of the potential issues and handle them correctly.
5. **Be careful when handling the edge cases.** The edge cases for this problem can be tricky, so make sure that you are aware of them and handle them correctly.
6. **Use a memory-efficient algorithm.** The problem statement specifies that the algorithm should run in time $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the array. Make sure that your algorithm does not use more memory than necessary.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1579_F. Array Stabilization (AND version)

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a list of integers. If you accidentally use a data type that is too small to store the integers, you will get an overflow error. For example, if you use `int` to store the array size `n`, and `n` is larger than `2^31 - 1`, you will get an overflow error.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks you to find the number of steps it takes for the array to stabilize. A naive algorithm would be to iterate over the array and check if each element is zero. If any element is not zero, then the array has not stabilized yet. This algorithm has a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the size of the array.

A more efficient algorithm would be to use dynamic programming. Dynamic programming allows us to store the results of subproblems and reuse them to solve larger problems. In this case, we can store the number of steps it takes for the array to stabilize after each shift. This allows us to quickly find the number of steps it takes for the array to stabilize after any number of shifts. The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(n)`.

**3. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

The problem states that the array size `n` is at most `10^6`. However, if you accidentally use a boundary condition that is too small, you may get an incorrect answer. For example, if you use a boundary condition of `n <= 100`, you may get an incorrect answer for an array with size `100000`.

**4. Not handling special cases**

The problem states that the array may contain all zeros or all ones. If you do not handle these special cases correctly, you may get an incorrect answer. For example, if the array contains all zeros, then the number of steps it takes for the array to stabilize is zero.

**5. Using incorrect code formatting**

The code you submit must be correctly formatted. If your code is not formatted correctly, it may be rejected by the judge. For example, you must use spaces between operators and operands.

**6. Making a syntax error**

The code you submit must be syntactically correct. If your code contains a syntax error, it will be rejected by the judge. For example, you must use curly braces to denote the body of a function.

**7. Using incorrect variable names**

The code you submit must use correct variable names. Variable names must start with a letter and can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. For example, you cannot use a variable name like `123abc`.

**8. Using undefined variables**

The code you submit must not use undefined variables. If you use an undefined variable, you will get a compiler error. For example, you cannot use a variable named `x` if you have not declared it before.

**9. Using uninitialized variables**

The code you submit must not use uninitialized variables. If you use an uninitialized variable, you will get a runtime error. For example, you cannot use a variable named `x` without first assigning it a value.

**10. Using incorrect operators**

The code you submit must use correct operators. For example, you must use the `+` operator to add two numbers, and the `*` operator to multiply two numbers.

CODEFORCES 1582_A. Luntik and Concerts

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input variables may not be correct, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program does not account for all possible cases, the results may be incorrect.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are common in programming, and can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program counts the number of elements in a list incorrectly, the results may be incorrect.
5. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks can occur when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions**. Race conditions can occur when two or more parts of a program access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
7. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks can occur when two or more parts of a program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish because it is waiting for the other. This can lead to the program running indefinitely or crashing.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can occur when a program is not properly protected from malicious attacks. This can lead to unauthorized access to the program or data, or the program being used to spread malware.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format, data types, logic, and other aspects of the program. It is also important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it produces the correct results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1582_F1. Korney Korneevich and XOR (easy version)

Pain points:
  1. **Incorrect use of `xor` operator.** The `xor` operator is a bitwise operator that performs a bitwise exclusive or operation on two operands. This means that the result of the operation is a new value that is equal to the bits that are different in the two operands. For example, if `a` is equal to `0100` and `b` is equal to `1010`, then the result of the `xor` operation will be `1110`.
2. **Incorrect use of `set` data structure.** A set is a data structure that stores a collection of unique elements. When you add an element to a set, the set will automatically remove any existing elements that are equal to the new element. This can cause problems if you are not careful, because it is possible to accidentally remove elements that you did not intend to remove.
3. **Incorrect use of `map` data structure.** A map is a data structure that stores a collection of key-value pairs. When you add a key-value pair to a map, the map will automatically create a new entry for the key if it does not already exist. This can cause problems if you are not careful, because it is possible to accidentally create duplicate entries.
4. **Incorrect use of `for` loop.** The `for` loop is a programming construct that allows you to iterate over a collection of elements. When you use a `for` loop, it is important to make sure that you are not iterating over the same element multiple times. This can cause problems because it is possible to miss elements or to process elements multiple times.
5. **Incorrect use of `if` statement.** The `if` statement is a programming construct that allows you to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true. When you use an `if` statement, it is important to make sure that the condition is correct. This can cause problems because it is possible to execute the block of code when it should not be executed, or to not execute the block of code when it should be executed.
6. **Incorrect use of `else` statement.** The `else` statement is a programming construct that allows you to execute a block of code if a certain condition is false. When you use an `else` statement, it is important to make sure that the condition is correct. This can cause problems because it is possible to execute the block of code when it should not be executed, or to not execute the block of code when it should be executed.
7. **Incorrect use of `break` statement.** The `break` statement is a programming construct that allows you to terminate a loop early. When you use a `break` statement, it is important to make sure that you are not terminating the loop at an incorrect time. This can cause problems because it is possible to miss elements or to process elements multiple times.
8. **Incorrect use of `continue` statement.** The `continue` statement is a programming construct that allows you to skip the current iteration of a loop. When you use a `continue` statement, it is important to make sure that you are not skipping an iteration that you need to process. This can cause problems because it is possible to miss elements or to process elements multiple times.
9. **Incorrect use of `return` statement.** The `return` statement is a programming construct that allows you to terminate a function early. When you use a `return` statement, it is important to make sure that you are not returning a value that is incorrect. This can cause problems because it is possible to return a value that is not expected, or to not return a value when one is expected.
10. **Incorrect use of `global` keyword.** The `global` keyword is a programming construct that allows you to access a variable that is declared outside of the current function. When you use the `global` keyword, it is important to make sure that you are not accessing a variable that you do not have permission to access. This can cause problems because it is possible to overwrite a variable that is used by another part of the program.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1586_A. Windblume Ode

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of integers. If we use an incorrect data type to store the input data, it may cause problems when we perform mathematical operations on the data. For example, if we use a `string` to store the input data, we will not be able to perform mathematical operations on the data.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the largest subset of the input data such that its sum is a composite number. A naive algorithm would be to iterate through all possible subsets of the input data and check if the sum of each subset is a composite number. However, this algorithm is very inefficient. A more efficient algorithm would be to use a greedy algorithm.

**3. Not handling corner cases**

The problem statement does not explicitly mention any corner cases. However, there are a few corner cases that we need to handle when solving this problem. For example, we need to handle the case where the input data is empty. We also need to handle the case where the sum of all elements in the input data is a prime number.

**4. Insufficient testing**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it to the judge. This will help you to identify and fix any bugs in your code. You should test your code with a variety of input data, including both valid and invalid input data. You should also test your code with different data types and different sizes of input data.

**5. Not following the problem statement**

It is important to read and understand the problem statement carefully before starting to work on a solution. This will help you to avoid making mistakes. If you are not sure about what the problem statement is asking you to do, you should ask for clarification.
Test inputs:
```
# 1. Using incorrect data type

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(3)
print(1, 2, 3)
```

This code will fail because the input data is a list of integers, but we are storing it in a `string`. This will cause problems when we try to perform mathematical operations on the data.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(3)
print(1, 2, 3)
```

This code will also fail because it is using a naive algorithm to find the largest subset of the input data such that its sum is a composite number. This algorithm is very inefficient and will not be able to solve large input data sets.

**3. Not handling corner cases**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(3)
print(1, 2, 3)
```

This code will also fail because it does not handle the case where the input data is empty. In this case, the correct output should be `0`.

**4. Insufficient testing**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(3)
print(1, 2, 3)
```

This code does not test for any invalid input data. For example, it does not test for the case where the input data contains a negative number.

**5. Not following the problem statement**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(3)
print(1, 2, 3)
```

This code does not follow the problem statement because it does not output the indices of the elements in the largest subset. The correct output should be a list of integers, not a string.

Here are some program inputs that will test for each of the potential problems listed above:

**1. Using incorrect data type**

```
n = "3"
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(3)
print(1, 2, 3)
```

This program input will cause the code to fail because the input data is a string, not a list of integers.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(3)
print(1, 2, 3)
```

This program input will cause the code to fail because it is using a naive algorithm to find the largest subset of the input data such that its sum is a composite number. This algorithm is very inefficient and will not be able to solve large input data sets.

**3. Not handling corner cases**

```
n = 0
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(3)
print(1, 2, 3)
```

This program input will cause the code to fail because it does not handle the case where the input data is empty. In this case, the correct output should be `0`.

**4. Insufficient testing**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(3)
print(1, 2, 3)
```

This program input does not test for any invalid input data. For example, it does not test for the case where the input data contains a negative number.

**5. Not following the problem statement**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(3)
print(1, 2, 3)
```

This program input does not follow the problem statement because it does not output the indices of the elements in the largest subset. The correct output should be a list of integers, not a string.

CODEFORCES 1586_B. Omkar and Heavenly Tree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrectly counting the number of nodes or edges.** This is a common mistake that can be easily avoided by carefully reading the problem statement and making sure that you understand the input and output formats.
2. **Misunderstanding the restrictions.** The restrictions in this problem are somewhat complex, so it is important to make sure that you understand them before you start solving the problem.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem, but not all of them are guaranteed to work. It is important to choose an algorithm that is appropriate for the problem and that you are familiar with.
4. **Making a programming error.** This is always a possibility when writing any kind of program, but it is especially important to be careful when writing code for a problem like this one, where even a small mistake can cause the program to fail.
5. **Not testing your code thoroughly.** It is always important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it, even if you are confident that it is correct. This will help you to catch any errors that you may have missed and ensure that your code is actually correct.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly counting the number of nodes or edges.** For example, a developer might forget to subtract 1 from the number of nodes when calculating the number of edges, or they might count an edge twice.
* **Misunderstanding the restrictions.** For example, a developer might think that a restriction means that node b cannot be adjacent to either node a or node c, when in reality it means that node b cannot lie on the simple path between node a and node c.
* **Using an incorrect algorithm.** For example, a developer might use a brute-force algorithm to solve this problem, when a more efficient algorithm is available.
* **Making a programming error.** For example, a developer might forget to initialize a variable or they might use the wrong data type.
* **Not testing your code thoroughly.** For example, a developer might only test their code on a few small test cases, when they should be testing it on a variety of different test cases.

By avoiding these common problems and bugs, you can increase your chances of successfully solving this problem.

CODEFORCES 1586_E. Moment of Bloom

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect graph representation:** The input graph may not be represented correctly, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, if two edges are represented as having the same endpoints, the algorithm may not be able to correctly determine whether they are part of the same cycle.
* **Incorrect query representation:** The queries may not be represented correctly, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, if a query specifies two nodes that are not connected by an edge, the algorithm may not be able to correctly determine whether it is possible to satisfy the query.
* **Incorrect edge weight representation:** The edge weights may not be represented correctly, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, if an edge is represented as having a weight of 1, the algorithm may not be able to correctly determine whether it is even or odd.
* **Incorrect number of queries:** The number of queries may not be represented correctly, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, if the number of queries is less than the number of edges in the graph, the algorithm may not be able to find a solution.
* **Incorrect solution representation:** The solution may not be represented correctly, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, if the solution specifies a path that does not exist in the graph, the algorithm may not be able to correctly verify that it is a valid solution.
* **Incorrect error handling:** The algorithm may not handle errors correctly, which could lead to incorrect results or a crash. For example, if the algorithm encounters an invalid input, it may not be able to correctly handle the error and may return incorrect results or crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1586_F. Defender of Childhood Dreams

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**

The input format is "n k", where n and k are integers. However, the input format in the example is "5 3". This is not correct because there is no space between the two integers.

**2. The output format is not correct**

The output format is "c\ncolors", where c is an integer and colors is a list of integers. However, the output format in the example is "2\n1 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1". This is not correct because there is no newline character between the two lines.

**3. The code does not work**

The code does not work because it does not account for the case where k is equal to n. In this case, all paths of length k or longer are automatically rainbow paths, so there is no need to color any of the edges.

**4. The code is not efficient**

The code is not efficient because it uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible combinations of colors. This is very inefficient, especially for large values of n and k.

**5. The code is not readable**

The code is not readable because it is not well-commented and uses a lot of abbreviations. This makes it difficult for other developers to understand what the code is doing.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1586_G. Omkar and Time Travel

Pain points:
**Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs That a Developer May Encounter When Solving This Problem:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the time travel rules.** The time travel rules are complex and easy to get wrong. For example, it is important to remember that Okabe can only time travel to a time when he has not already completed the task. Another important detail is that Okabe's time travel can undo tasks that he has already completed.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the funny scene condition.** The funny scene condition is also complex and easy to get wrong. It is important to remember that the funny scene only occurs when all of the tasks in the set $s$ are simultaneously completed.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the modulo operation.** The modulo operation is used throughout the solution, and it is important to make sure that it is implemented correctly.
4. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The solution uses a number of data structures, such as arrays and sets. It is important to make sure that these data structures are used correctly.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The solution should handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input is invalid, the solution should print an error message and exit.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

CODEFORCES 1586_H. Omkar and Tours

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm.** The Dijkstra algorithm is a very common algorithm for finding the shortest path between two vertices in a graph. However, it is important to implement the algorithm correctly, or you may get incorrect results.
* **Incorrect handling of negative edge weights.** The Dijkstra algorithm can handle negative edge weights, but it is important to be careful when doing so. If you are not careful, you may end up with an infinite loop.
* **Incorrect handling of multiple sources or destinations.** The Dijkstra algorithm can be used to find the shortest path from a single source to a single destination. However, it can also be used to find the shortest path from multiple sources to a single destination, or from a single source to multiple destinations. It is important to be careful when implementing the algorithm in these cases, or you may get incorrect results.
* **Incorrect handling of edge capacities.** The Dijkstra algorithm can be used to find the shortest path between two vertices in a graph, even if the edges have capacities. However, it is important to be careful when doing so, or you may get incorrect results.
* **Incorrect handling of tolls.** The Dijkstra algorithm can be used to find the shortest path between two vertices in a graph, even if the edges have tolls. However, it is important to be careful when doing so, or you may get incorrect results.

**Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:**

* **Test your implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm thoroughly.** Make sure that you test your implementation on a variety of graphs, with both positive and negative edge weights, and with both single and multiple sources and destinations.
* **Be careful when handling negative edge weights.** Make sure that you check for negative cycles in your graph, and handle them correctly.
* **Be careful when handling multiple sources or destinations.** Make sure that you correctly initialize the priority queue in your implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm.
* **Be careful when handling edge capacities.** Make sure that you correctly update the edge capacities in your implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm.
* **Be careful when handling tolls.** Make sure that you correctly update the tolls in your implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm.

CODEFORCES 1591_A. Life of a Flower

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program, which will lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may forget to check if the flower is watered for two days in a row, or may incorrectly calculate the flower's height.
2. **Incorrect data types**. The developer may use the wrong data types for the input and output values, which will lead to errors. For example, the developer may use an integer to store the flower's height, when it should actually be a floating-point number.
3. **Incorrect error handling**. The developer may not handle errors correctly, which could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results. For example, the developer may not check if the input values are valid, or may not handle the case where the flower dies.
4. **Inefficient code**. The developer may write inefficient code, which will slow down the program. For example, the developer may use a nested loop to iterate over the input values, when a single loop would be sufficient.
5. **Unclear code**. The developer may write code that is unclear or difficult to understand, which makes it difficult to debug and maintain. For example, the developer may use abbreviations or cryptic variable names.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1591_B. Array Eversion

Pain points:
```
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem states that "after several eversions the array a stops changing". This means that the array will eventually reach a state where it does not change after any further eversions. A common mistake is to assume that the array will stop changing after a certain number of eversions. This is not necessarily true, and can lead to incorrect solutions.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the eversion operation.** The eversion operation partitions the array into two parts: left and right. The left part contains the elements of the array that are not greater than the pivot element, and the right part contains the elements of the array that are greater than the pivot element. The order of elements in each part is kept the same as before the operation. A common mistake is to incorrectly implement the eversion operation, which can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem states that the array a may contain duplicate elements. A common mistake is to incorrectly handle duplicate elements, which can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem states that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. This means that the array a may contain up to 2 * 10^5 elements. A common mistake is to use an inefficient data structure to store the array a, which can lead to a time limit exceeded error.
5. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** The problem states that the array a stops changing after a certain number of eversions. This means that the array a must eventually reach a state where it is sorted. A common mistake is to use an inefficient algorithm to sort the array a, which can lead to a time limit exceeded error.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1591_C. Minimize Distance

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly parsed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is "1 2 3", the first integer "1" will be interpreted as the number of test cases, and the second and third integers "2 3" will be interpreted as the number of depots and the capacity of each bag, respectively. This will result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum distance**. The minimum distance may be incorrectly calculated, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the depots are located at [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and the capacity of each bag is 1, the minimum distance is 25, not 20.
3. **Incorrect handling of duplicate depots**. The depots may be duplicated, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the depots are located at [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and the capacity of each bag is 1, the minimum distance is 25, not 20.
4. **Incorrect handling of the boundary cases**. The boundary cases may not be handled correctly, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the number of depots is 0, the minimum distance is 0, not 1.
5. **Incorrect handling of the special cases**. The special cases may not be handled correctly, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the depots are all located at the same position, the minimum distance is 0, not 1.

CODEFORCES 1591_D. Yet Another Sorting Problem

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong data type. For example, the numbers in the input may be strings instead of integers. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating through the input data, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one or more elements. This can lead to the program producing incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect. For example, the program may not be able to correctly identify the 3-cycles that need to be applied to sort the array. This can lead to the program producing incorrect output.
5. **Memory leaks**. The program may not be releasing memory that it is no longer using. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions**. The program may not be thread-safe. This can lead to incorrect output if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may contain security vulnerabilities, such as allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1591_E. Frequency Queries

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. The tree traversal algorithm should visit each vertex exactly once, and the order in which the vertices are visited should not matter. If the algorithm is not implemented correctly, it may miss some vertices or visit them multiple times, which will lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the frequency counting algorithm.** The frequency counting algorithm should count the number of occurrences of each integer in the sequence of integers on the path from the vertex v to the root. If the algorithm is not implemented correctly, it may count some integers incorrectly, which will lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the sorting algorithm.** The sorting algorithm should sort the sequence of integers on the path from the vertex v to the root by the number of occurrences in the original list in increasing order. If the algorithm is not implemented correctly, it may not sort the sequence correctly, which will lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect implementation of the answer selection algorithm.** The answer selection algorithm should select the k-th number in the remaining sequence. If the algorithm is not implemented correctly, it may select the wrong number, which will lead to incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect input validation.** The input should be validated to ensure that it is correct. If the input is not validated correctly, it may lead to incorrect results or errors.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements. They should also carefully implement the tree traversal algorithm, the frequency counting algorithm, the sorting algorithm, the answer selection algorithm, and the input validation.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1594_C. Make Them Equal

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly parsed by the compiler, which can lead to unexpected errors. For example, if the input contains a newline character instead of a space, the compiler may interpret the input as a single line of text, instead of two separate lines. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect variable type**. The variable type used to store the input data must be compatible with the data type of the input. For example, if the input is a string, the variable used to store it must be of type `string`. If the variable type is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The program may contain errors in the calculation of the output data. For example, the program may incorrectly calculate the number of operations required to make all the characters equal to `c`. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the program must be correct. For example, the output must be a single line of numbers, separated by spaces. If the output format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.
5. **Other bugs**. There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. Some common examples include:
    * Using the wrong variable name
    * Forgetting to initialize a variable
    * Using an incorrect data type
    * Making a logical error in the code
    * Misusing a library function

It is important to be aware of these possible problems and to carefully check your code for errors before submitting it.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1594_D. The Number of Imposters

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The developer may incorrectly type a variable, resulting in a bug. For example, they might type `int n = 'a'` instead of `int n = 'a'`. This would cause the program to crash.
2. **Off-by-one error:** The developer may forget to increment or decrement a variable by one, resulting in an incorrect output. For example, they might iterate over a list of numbers from 0 to 9, but forget to include 10 in the list. This would cause the program to miss the last number in the list.
3. **Logic error:** The developer may make a mistake in their logic, resulting in an incorrect output. For example, they might assume that a variable is always positive, when it could actually be negative. This would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
4. **Memory leak:** The developer may allocate memory for a variable and then forget to free it, resulting in a memory leak. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
5. **Race condition:** The developer may write code that accesses shared data without locking it, resulting in a race condition. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
6. **Deadlock:** The developer may write code that creates a situation where two or more threads are waiting for each other to finish, resulting in a deadlock. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely.
7. **Security vulnerability:** The developer may write code that is vulnerable to attack, such as a buffer overflow or SQL injection. This can allow an attacker to gain access to the program's data or even take control of the program.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1594_E1. Rubik's Cube Coloring (easy version)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is an integer, but the developer may mistakenly use a float or string. This will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The developer may make a mistake in the calculation of the number of colorings. This could result in an incorrect answer or a runtime error.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may forget to add or subtract 1 when calculating the number of nodes in the tree. This will result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Memory leak**. The developer may not properly free the memory allocated for the tree. This will eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
5. **Infinite loop**. The developer may write a loop that never terminates. This will cause the program to run indefinitely and eventually crash.
6. **Incorrect input handling**. The developer may not properly handle invalid input. This could result in the program crashing or producing an incorrect output.
7. **Security vulnerability**. The developer may introduce a security vulnerability by using insecure coding practices. This could allow an attacker to gain access to the program's data or control the program's execution.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully review their code and test it thoroughly. They should also use a debugger to help identify any errors.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1594_E2. Rubik's Cube Coloring (hard version)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The problem statement specifies that the input should be an integer, but the following code incorrectly reads it as a string:

```
k = input()
```

This will cause the program to crash when it tries to perform arithmetic operations on the input.

2. **Off-by-one error.** The following code incorrectly calculates the number of nodes in the tree:

```
n = int(input())
nodes = [0] * (2 ** k)
```

This will cause the program to miss the last node in the tree, which will result in an incorrect answer.

3. **Incorrect array bounds.** The following code incorrectly accesses an element of the `nodes` array that is out of bounds:

```
nodes[n] = 1
```

This will cause the program to crash.

4. **Incorrect modulo arithmetic.** The following code incorrectly calculates the number of good colorings:

```
ans = (ans * 6) % MOD
```

This will cause the program to overflow and return an incorrect answer.

5. **Incorrect use of the `pow()` function.** The following code incorrectly uses the `pow()` function to calculate the number of good colorings:

```
ans = pow(6, n, MOD)
```

This will cause the program to return an incorrect answer.

6. **Incorrect use of the `gcd()` function.** The following code incorrectly uses the `gcd()` function to calculate the number of good colorings:

```
ans = gcd(ans, MOD)
```

This will cause the program to return an incorrect answer.

7. **Incorrect use of the `mod()` function.** The following code incorrectly uses the `mod()` function to calculate the number of good colorings:

Title:
CODEFORCES 1598_A. Computer Game

Pain points:
**1. Input Format**

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of columns.

The next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level — the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.

**2. Output Format**

For each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.

**3. Constraints**

Additional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.

**4. Examples**

```

```

**5. Solution**

The following are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly identifying the starting and ending cells.** The starting cell is always (1, 1), and the ending cell is always (2, n). If the developer incorrectly identifies either of these cells, the solution will be incorrect.
* **Incorrectly checking for traps.** The cells at (1, 1) and (2, n) are always safe, so the developer should not check for traps in these cells.
* **Incorrectly checking for reachable cells.** A cell is reachable if it is adjacent to the current cell and is not a trap. The developer should make sure to check for all possible adjacent cells, including cells that are diagonally adjacent.
* **Incorrectly implementing the backtracking algorithm.** The backtracking algorithm is a recursive algorithm that can be used to find all possible paths from a starting cell to an ending cell. The developer should make sure to correctly implement the backtracking algorithm, or the solution will be incorrect.

**6. Testing**

The following are some tests that can be used to test the solution:

* A test case with a single cell that is not a trap.
* A test case with two cells that are not traps.
* A test case with three cells that are not traps.
* A test case with four cells that are not traps.
* A test case with five cells that are not traps.
* A test case with six cells that are not traps.
* A test case with seven cells that are not traps.
* A test case with eight cells that are not traps.
* A test case with nine cells that are not traps.
* A test case with ten cells that are not traps.

**7. Conclusion**

The following are some tips for debugging the solution:

* Use a debugger to step through the code and identify the line where the error occurs.
* Print out the values of the variables at each step of the program to see how they are changing.
* Use a test harness to test the solution with different input values.
* Ask for help from a mentor or other experienced developer.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1598_C. Delete Two Elements

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect calculation of the mathematical mean.** The mathematical mean of an array is the sum of its elements divided by the number of elements. It is important to make sure that you are dividing by the correct number of elements, especially if the array is empty or has zero elements.
2. **Incorrectly identifying pairs of elements that can be deleted.** In order to find the number of pairs of elements that can be deleted, you need to consider all possible pairs of elements and check whether the mathematical mean of the remaining elements is still equal to k. This can be a time-consuming process, so it is important to optimize your code as much as possible.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** There are a few edge cases that you need to be aware of when solving this problem. For example, what happens if the array is empty or has zero elements? What happens if the mathematical mean of the array is not an integer?

**Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:**

1. **Use a test suite to thoroughly test your code.** A test suite will help you identify any bugs in your code before you submit it.
2. **Use a debugger to step through your code and identify errors.** A debugger can help you track down errors in your code and understand how it is working.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1598_E. Staircases

Pain points:
**Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs That a Developer May Encounter When Solving This Problem:**

* **Incorrectly counting the number of staircases.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. They often forget to take into account the fact that a staircase can start and end in any cell of the matrix, not just in the top-left and bottom-right cells.
* **Not handling queries correctly.** The queries in this problem can change the state of any cell in the matrix, so it is important to make sure that you are correctly updating your data structures to reflect these changes.
* **Time complexity.** The naive solution to this problem has a time complexity of O(n^2 * m^2), which is too slow for large inputs. A more efficient solution can be obtained by using dynamic programming.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that developers may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly counting the number of staircases.** A developer might incorrectly count the number of staircases by only considering the staircases that start and end in the top-left and bottom-right cells of the matrix. This will result in an incorrect answer, as there are many other staircases that can exist in the matrix.
* **Not handling queries correctly.** A developer might not correctly handle queries that change the state of a cell in the matrix. This could result in the developer incorrectly counting the number of staircases or in the developer's data structures becoming corrupted.
* **Time complexity.** A developer might use a naive solution to this problem that has a time complexity of O(n^2 * m^2). This solution will be too slow for large inputs. A more efficient solution can be obtained by using dynamic programming.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* **Be careful when counting the number of staircases.** Make sure that you are correctly taking into account the fact that a staircase can start and end in any cell of the matrix.
* **Test your code thoroughly.** Make sure that you test your code with a variety of inputs, including inputs that contain queries that change the state of cells in the matrix.
* **Use efficient data structures.** Use data structures that are designed for dynamic programming problems, such as hash tables and binary heaps.
* **Optimize your code.** Use compiler optimizations and other techniques to improve the performance of your code.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1598_F. RBS

Pain points:
**Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs That a Developer May Encounter When Solving This Problem:**

1. **Incorrectly counting the number of RBS prefixes.** This is a common mistake that can be made when the input contains multiple strings. It is important to remember that each string can only be used once in the final answer, so you cannot simply count the number of RBS prefixes in each string and add them together. Instead, you need to consider the order in which the strings are concatenated.
2. **Not handling unbalanced parentheses correctly.** Another common mistake is to not handle unbalanced parentheses correctly. This can happen when a string ends with a closing parenthesis or when two strings are concatenated together and the resulting string has an odd number of parentheses. In these cases, you need to make sure that the final answer does not contain any RBS prefixes that start with a closing parenthesis.
3. **Using incorrect data structures.** The input to this problem is a list of strings, so it is important to use a data structure that is designed to store and manipulate lists. A common mistake is to use a list of characters instead of a list of strings. This can lead to errors when you try to count the number of RBS prefixes in each string.
4. **Not using efficient algorithms.** The time complexity of your solution should be O(n), where n is the number of strings in the input. A common mistake is to use a recursive algorithm to solve this problem. This can lead to a time complexity of O(2^n), which is not efficient enough for large inputs.
5. **Not testing your code thoroughly.** It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it to Codeforces. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed. A common mistake is to only test your code on small inputs. This can lead to errors when you try to run your code on large inputs.

CODEFORCES 1599_E. Two Arrays

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of Fibonacci sequence.** The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

```
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1
```

A common mistake is to implement the Fibonacci sequence as follows:

```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

This implementation is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the Fibonacci sequence is defined for all non-negative integers. To fix this, we can add an additional check to the `if` statement to ensure that `n` is non-negative:

```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be non-negative")
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

2. **Incorrect handling of queries.** The problem statement specifies that each query must be of one of the following types:

* 1 k l r x
* 2 k l r x
* 3 k l r x
* 4 l r

A common mistake is to forget to check the type of the query before processing it. This can lead to errors such as accessing elements of arrays out of bounds or performing invalid operations on the data.

To avoid this mistake, we can use a switch statement to check the type of the query and then call the appropriate function to process it. For example:

```
def process_query(query):
    type, k, l, r, x = query
    switch(type):
        case 1:
            process_query_type_1(k, l, r, x)
        case 2:
            process_query_type_2(k, l, r, x)
        case 3:
            process_query_type_3(k, l, r, x)
        case 4:
            process_query_type_4(l, r)
```

3. **Incorrect calculation of Fibonacci numbers.** The Fibonacci numbers are calculated using the following formula:

```
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
```

A common mistake is to use this formula incorrectly, such as by using the wrong values for `n-1` and `n-2`. This can lead to errors in the calculation of the Fibonacci numbers, which can in turn lead to incorrect answers to the queries.

To avoid this mistake, we can use a lookup table to store the values of the Fibonacci numbers. This will allow us to quickly and easily calculate the Fibonacci numbers for any given value of `n`.

4. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The Fibonacci numbers can grow very quickly, and it is possible for them to overflow the data type of the variables that are used to store them. This can lead to errors such as incorrect calculations or segmentation faults.

To avoid this problem, we can use a large data type to store the Fibonacci numbers. For example, we can use the `long` data type in Python or the `int64` data type in C++.

5. **Incorrect use of dynamic memory allocation.** The problem statement specifies that the arrays `A1` and `A2` can have a maximum length of `N`. This means that we need to dynamically allocate memory for these arrays.

A common mistake is to forget to free the memory that is allocated for these arrays. This can lead to memory leaks, which can eventually cause the program to crash.

To avoid this problem, we can use the `free()` function to free the memory that is allocated for these arrays.

6. **Incorrect use of pointers.** The problem statement specifies that the arrays `A1` and `A2` are passed to the functions as pointers. This means that we need to make sure that we use these pointers correctly.

A common mistake is to dereference a pointer that is not valid. This can lead to errors such as segmentation faults.

To avoid this problem, we can check the validity of the pointers before dereferencing them.

7. **Incorrect use of arrays.** The problem statement specifies that the arrays `A1` and

Title:
CODEFORCES 1599_F. Mars

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for storing the input or output.**

The input and output of this problem are integers. If you use the wrong data type, such as strings or floats, you will get incorrect results.

**2. Not handling the corner cases correctly.**

The problem states that the length of the array of cities and the number of queries are both at most 2\*10^5. If you do not handle this case correctly, your code may run into an out-of-bounds error.

**3. Making a mistake in the algorithm.**

The algorithm for solving this problem is relatively simple. However, it is easy to make a mistake, such as forgetting to update a variable or using the wrong formula.

**4. Not using efficient data structures.**

The problem can be solved using a simple array to store the input and a queue to store the queries. However, you can use more efficient data structures, such as a hash table or a binary search tree, to improve the performance of your code.

**5. Not testing your code thoroughly.**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it to the judge. This will help you catch any bugs that you may have missed.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1599_G. Shortest path

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is two integers, N and K, followed by N lines of two integers, A<sub>i</sub> and B<sub>i</sub>. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output for this problem should be a single floating-point number, the shortest distance to visit all of the points. If the output format is not correct, the program will not be accepted by the judge.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the shortest distance.** The shortest distance to visit all of the points is the sum of the distances between each pair of points. To calculate this distance, you can use the Pythagorean theorem.
4. **Inefficient algorithm.** The naive algorithm for solving this problem would be to calculate the distance between each pair of points and then find the shortest path. This algorithm would be very inefficient, as it would require O(N<sup>2</sup>) time.
5. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.** Floating-point numbers are subject to rounding errors, which can cause the program to produce incorrect results. To avoid this problem, you should use the `<math.h>` library to perform floating-point calculations.
6. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that can occur when programming. In this problem, an off-by-one error could occur when calculating the index of a point or when calculating the distance between two points.
7. **Logic errors.** Logic errors are another common type of error that can occur when programming. In this problem, a logic error could occur when determining the order in which to visit the points or when calculating the shortest distance.
8. **Memory errors.** Memory errors can occur when a program allocates too much or too little memory. In this problem, a memory error could occur if the program allocates too much memory for the points or if the program does not free the memory that it has allocated.
9. **Timeout errors.** Timeout errors can occur when a program takes too long to run. In this problem, a timeout error could occur if the program is not efficient enough.
10. **Presentation errors.** Presentation errors are errors that occur when the output of the program is not formatted correctly. In this problem, a presentation error could occur if the output is not in the correct format or if the output is not readable.
Test inputs:
**Incorrect input format:**

```
5 2
0 0
-1 1
2 -2
0 1
-2 2
```

This input is incorrect because the first line does not contain two integers. The program should return an error.

**Incorrect output format:**

```
5 2
0 0
-1 1
2 -2
0 1
-2 2

7.4787091
```

This output is incorrect because it is not a floating-point number. The program should return an error.

**Incorrect calculation of the shortest distance:**

```
5 2
0 0
-1 1
2 -2
0 1
-2 2

1000000000
```

This output is incorrect because it is not the shortest distance to visit all of the points. The program should return the correct answer.

**Inefficient algorithm:**

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    int n, k;
    scanf(" %d%d ", &n, &k);
    int i, j;
    double a[n], b[n];
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf(" %lf%lf ", &a[i], &b[i]);
    }
    double d = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            d += sqrt((a[i] - a[j]) * (a[i] - a[j]) + (b[i] - b[j]) * (b[i] - b[j]));
        }
    }
    printf(" %lf ", d);
    return 0;
}
```

This program is inefficient because it calculates the distance between each pair of points, even though only a subset of the points are on the same line. The program should only calculate the distance between the points that are not on the same line.

**Incorrect use of floating-point numbers:**

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    int n, k;
    scanf(" %d%d ", &n, &k);
    int i, j;
    double a[n], b[n];
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf(" %lf%lf ", &a[i], &b[i]);
    }
    double d = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            d += sqrt((a[i] - a[j]) * (a[i] - a[j]) + (b[i] - b[j]) * (b[i] - b[j]));
        }
    }
    printf(" %.15lf ", d);
    return 0;
}
```

This program uses the `%.15lf` format specifier to print the output, which is too many digits for the precision of the floating-point numbers. The program should use the `%.12lf` format specifier to print the output.

**Off-by-one errors:**

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    int n, k;
    scanf(" %d%d ", &n, &k);
    int i, j;
    double a[n], b[n];
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf(" %lf%lf ", &a[i], &b[i]);
    }
    double d = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (j = i + 2; j < n; j++) {
            d += sqrt((a[i] - a[j]) * (a[i] - a[j]) + (b[i] - b[j]) * (b[i] - b[j]));
        }
    }
    printf(" %lf ", d);
    return 0;

Title:
CODEFORCES 1601_A. Array Elimination

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data is given as integers. However, the problem states that the elements of the array can be up to 2^30. This means that we need to use a data type that can store such large numbers. Using an integer data type will lead to an overflow error.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The problem states that we need to find all possible values of k such that it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to 0 using a finite number of elimination operations with parameter k. A naive algorithm would be to iterate over all possible values of k and check if it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to 0 using k elimination operations. However, this algorithm would have a time complexity of O(nk), which is too slow.

**3. Not handling special cases**

The problem states that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 200,000. This means that we need to handle the case where n is equal to 200,000. A naive algorithm would not handle this case correctly.

**4. Using incorrect logic**

The problem states that we need to find all possible values of k such that it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to 0 using a finite number of elimination operations with parameter k. However, a naive algorithm would only find one possible value of k.

**5. Not testing your code**

It's important to test your code before submitting it to the judge. This will help you to catch any errors in your code and ensure that it is correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1601_C. Optimal Insertion

Pain points:
**Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of merge sort**. The most common mistake is to implement merge sort incorrectly. This can lead to incorrect results and incorrect time complexity.
2. **Incorrect handling of duplicates**. When merging two sorted arrays, it is important to handle duplicates correctly. If duplicates are not handled correctly, this can lead to incorrect results and incorrect time complexity.
3. **Inefficient data structures**. Using inefficient data structures can lead to slow runtimes. For example, using a linked list to store the elements of an array will be much slower than using an array.
4. **Incorrect use of binary search**. Binary search is a very powerful tool, but it is important to use it correctly. If binary search is used incorrectly, this can lead to incorrect results and incorrect time complexity.
5. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that can be difficult to find. These errors occur when a programmer accidentally counts one element too many or one element too few.
6. **Arithmetic errors**. Arithmetic errors can occur when a programmer accidentally miscalculates an expression. These errors can be difficult to find, especially when the expression is complex.
7. **Logic errors**. Logic errors occur when a programmer makes a mistake in their reasoning. These errors can be difficult to find, especially when the code is complex.

**Tips for Avoiding Problems and Bugs:**

1. **Test your code thoroughly**. The best way to find bugs is to test your code thoroughly. This means testing your code with a variety of inputs and checking for both correct results and incorrect results.
2. **Use a debugger**. A debugger can be a helpful tool for finding bugs. A debugger allows you to step through your code line by line and watch the values of variables change. This can help you identify the source of a bug.
3. **Get help from others**. If you are stuck on a bug, don't be afraid to ask for help from others. There are many online resources available, such as forums and Stack Overflow. You can also ask for help from your friends or colleagues.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1601_F. Two Sorts

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**

The modulo operator in Python is denoted by `%`. However, in this problem, we need to use the modulo operator `%` with a large modulus, `998244353`. If we accidentally use the modulo operator `%` with a smaller modulus, such as `10`, our answer will be incorrect.

For example, the following code will return the wrong answer:

```python
n = int(input())

sum = 0
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    sum += (i % 10)

print(sum % 10)
```

The correct answer is `289817887`, but the above code will return `994733045`.

**2. Using the wrong data type**

The input `n` is a positive integer, so we need to use the `int` data type to store it. If we accidentally use the `str` data type to store `n`, our code will not work correctly.

For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```python
n = input()

sum = 0
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    sum += (i % 10)

print(sum % 10)
```

The above code will raise a `TypeError` exception because the `str` data type does not have a `%` operator.

**3. Using the wrong algorithm**

The correct algorithm for this problem is to use the following formula:

```
sum = (n * (n + 1)) // 2
```

However, if we accidentally use a different algorithm, our answer will be incorrect.

For example, the following code will return the wrong answer:

```python
n = int(input())

sum = 0
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    sum += i

print(sum % 10)
```

The correct answer is `289817887`, but the above code will return `978932159`.

**4. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

The input `n` is a positive integer, so we need to make sure that we check for the boundary condition `n <= 0`. If we do not check for this boundary condition, our code will not work correctly for inputs such as `n = 0`.

For example, the following code will not work correctly for inputs such as `n = 0`:

```python
n = int(input())

sum = 0
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    sum += (i % 10)

print(sum % 10)
```

The above code will raise a `ValueError` exception because the `range()` function does not support inputs such as `n = 0`.

CODEFORCES 1604_C. Di-visible Confusion

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem states that the first line of each test case should contain a single integer n. However, if the input format is incorrect, such as if the first line of a test case contains two integers, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem states that the output should be either "YES" or "NO". However, if the output is incorrect, such as if the output is "yes" or "no", the program will not be accepted.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem must be correct in order for the program to be accepted. For example, if the algorithm does not consider all possible cases, the program will not be accepted.
4. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the variables used in the program must be correct in order for the program to be accepted. For example, if the variable n is declared as a string, the program will not be accepted.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1604_D. Moderate Modular Mode

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input constraints for this problem are 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^18. However, if you use an integer data type, you will only be able to store numbers up to 2^31 - 1. This means that you will not be able to correctly handle inputs that are larger than this.

To avoid this problem, you should use a long long data type, which can store numbers up to 2^63 - 1.

**2. Not handling negative numbers correctly**

The input for this problem does not specify whether the numbers x and y can be negative. However, the output must be a positive number.

To avoid this problem, you should check if either x or y is negative. If either of them is negative, you should add 2 * x to both x and y. This will make both of them positive, and the output will still be correct.

**3. Using the wrong modulo operator**

The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. For example, 10 % 3 = 1. However, this is not the same as the congruence operator (≡). The congruence operator returns the smallest integer that is congruent to a modulo m. For example, 10 ≡ 7 (mod 3).

To avoid this problem, you should use the congruence operator instead of the modulo operator.

**4. Not using the Chinese remainder theorem**

The Chinese remainder theorem is a theorem that allows you to find the smallest integer that is congruent to a₁ modulo m₁, a₂ modulo m₂, ..., aₙ modulo mₙ. This is exactly what you need to do in this problem.

To use the Chinese remainder theorem, you need to find the least common multiple of m₁, m₂, ..., mₙ. Then, you need to find integers x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ such that x₁ ≡ a₁ (mod m₁), x₂ ≡ a₂ (mod m₂), ..., xₙ ≡ aₙ (mod mₙ). Finally, you need to return the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ.

**5. Not handling overflow correctly**

When you are adding or multiplying large numbers, you need to be careful about overflow. Overflow occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be represented by the data type that you are using.

To avoid overflow, you should use the following techniques:

* Use the long long data type for storing numbers.
* Use the bitwise shift operator (<<) to multiply numbers by powers of 2.
* Use the bitwise AND operator (&) to check if a number is negative.
* Use the bitwise OR operator (|) to add numbers.

CODEFORCES 1604_E. Extreme Extension

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect implementation of the dynamic programming algorithm.** This is the most common mistake that programmers make when solving this problem. The dynamic programming algorithm for this problem is relatively simple, but it is easy to make a mistake in the implementation.
* **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The input to this problem may contain some edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with all elements equal. It is important to handle these edge cases correctly.
* **Incorrect use of modular arithmetic.** This problem requires the use of modular arithmetic, and it is important to use it correctly. For example, you should be careful not to overflow the modulus when performing arithmetic operations.
* **Incorrect use of data structures.** The input to this problem is an array of integers, and you need to use a data structure to store the information about the extreme values of all subarrays. It is important to choose the right data structure for this problem.
* **Incorrect time complexity.** The dynamic programming algorithm for this problem has a time complexity of O(n^2). It is important to make sure that your implementation does not have a worse time complexity.
* **Incorrect space complexity.** The dynamic programming algorithm for this problem has a space complexity of O(n^2). It is important to make sure that your implementation does not have a worse space complexity.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1606_A. AB Balance

Pain points:
**Possible Problems**

1. **Incorrectly counting the number of occurrences of ab and ba substrings.** This is a common mistake that can be made when solving this problem. To avoid this, make sure that you are correctly counting the number of occurrences of each substring. One way to do this is to use a sliding window to keep track of the number of occurrences of each substring.
2. **Not considering all possible solutions.** When solving this problem, it is important to consider all possible solutions. This means that you should not just look for the first solution that you find. Instead, you should try to find all possible solutions and then choose the one that requires the fewest number of steps.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. However, not all of these algorithms are correct. Make sure that you are using an algorithm that is guaranteed to find the optimal solution.
4. **Making a mistake in your implementation.** Even if you have a correct algorithm, you can still make a mistake in your implementation. This can happen if you make a typo or if you misunderstand the problem statement. To avoid this, carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand what you are being asked to do. Then, carefully implement your algorithm and test it on a few small examples to make sure that it is correct.

**Possible Bugs**

1. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that can occur when programming. This type of bug occurs when you accidentally miscount by one. For example, if you are trying to count the number of occurrences of a substring in a string, you might accidentally count one occurrence too many or one occurrence too few.
2. **Incorrectly handling boundary conditions.** Boundary conditions are another common type of bug that can occur when programming. This type of bug occurs when you do not handle the edge cases correctly. For example, if you are trying to find the minimum number of steps to balance the number of ab and ba substrings in a string, you need to make sure that you handle the case where the string is empty or the string only contains one character.
3. **Using incorrect data types.** Using incorrect data types can also lead to bugs. For example, if you are trying to count the number of occurrences of a substring in a string, you should use an integer data type to store the count. Using a floating-point data type could lead to rounding errors, which could cause your program to produce incorrect results.
4. **Using incorrect mathematical operators.** Using incorrect mathematical operators can also lead to bugs. For example, if you are trying to find the minimum number of steps to balance the number of ab and ba substrings in a string, you should use the minimum operator (min) to find the smallest possible number of steps. Using the subtraction operator (-) could lead to incorrect results.

Pain points:
 * n=1, k=1: 
    1. during the first hour, we copy the update files from the computer 1 to the computer 1. 
 **Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is "8 3", the program may incorrectly parse it as "83", which is not a valid input.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of hours:** The minimum number of hours required to copy the update files to all n computers is not correctly calculated. For example, if the input is "8 3", the program may incorrectly calculate the minimum number of hours as 3, when the correct answer is 4.
3. **Incorrect use of variables:** The variables are not used correctly, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the variable `n` is used to store the number of computers, the program may incorrectly use it to store the number of patch cables.
4. **Incorrect logic:** The logic of the program is not correct, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may incorrectly copy the update files from the computer 1 to the computer 2, when the update files are already installed on the computer 2.
5. **Off-by-one errors:** The program may make off-by-one errors, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may incorrectly copy the update files to the computer 7, when the computer 7 does not exist.
6. **Memory leaks:** The program may leak memory, which can lead to performance problems. For example, the program may create a new array for each iteration of the loop, when the array could be reused.
7. **Stack overflow:** The program may cause a stack overflow, which can lead to the program crashing. For example, the program may create a recursive function that calls itself too many times.
8. **Garbage collection errors:** The program may cause garbage collection errors, which can lead to performance problems. For example, the program may create a large object that is never used, which will eventually be garbage collected.
9. **Synchronization errors:** The program may cause synchronization errors, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may access a shared resource without first acquiring a lock.
10. **Race conditions:** The program may cause race conditions, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may update a shared resource without first synchronizing with other threads.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1607_F. Robot on the Board 2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is a string, but the code is expecting an integer. This can be fixed by using the `int()` function to convert the string to an integer.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The code is counting the number of rows and columns incorrectly. This can be fixed by adding one to each of the values.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code is not correctly determining the starting cell for the robot. This can be fixed by using a different algorithm to find the starting cell.
4. **Memory leak**. The code is not freeing up memory after it is used. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually crash the program. This can be fixed by using the `del` keyword to delete objects that are no longer needed.
5. **Race condition**. The code is not thread-safe. This means that it can be interrupted by another thread, which can lead to incorrect results. This can be fixed by using locks to protect shared data.
6. **Security vulnerability**. The code is not secure. This means that it is vulnerable to attacks such as injection attacks and cross-site scripting attacks. This can be fixed by using proper input validation and escaping of output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1607_H. Banquet Preparations 2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program's execution. For example, if the number of dishes is not specified, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The data type of the input values must be correctly specified, otherwise the program will not be able to process them correctly. For example, if the number of dishes is specified as a string, the program will not be able to convert it to an integer and will crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when the programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to incorrect results or even the program crashing. For example, if the program is supposed to print the first 100 numbers, but the programmer forgets to increment the counter by one, the program will only print the first 99 numbers.
4. **Logic errors.** Logic errors occur when the programmer makes a mistake in the logic of the program. This can lead to incorrect results or even the program crashing. For example, if the program is supposed to find the minimum value in an array, but the programmer accidentally compares the first element with the second element, the program will return the wrong answer.
5. **Memory errors.** Memory errors occur when the program allocates more memory than it needs or fails to free memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to the program crashing or running slowly. For example, if the program allocates a large array of memory but only uses a small portion of it, the program will waste memory and run slower than necessary.
6. **Synchronization errors.** Synchronization errors occur when multiple threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to data corruption or the program crashing. For example, if two threads are both trying to update the same variable, the program may end up with an incorrect value for the variable.
7. **Security vulnerabilities.** Security vulnerabilities occur when the program is not properly protected from malicious attacks. This can allow attackers to access sensitive data or even take control of the program. For example, if the program does not properly validate user input, an attacker could send the program malicious data that could be used to exploit a security vulnerability.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line of each test case should contain a single integer n, but some test cases may have a different format. For example, the input `1` may be interpreted as a test case with 1 player, or as a test case with no players.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that each test case should print a string of length n, but some solutions may print a string of a different length. For example, the solution `'1'` may be interpreted as a test case with 1 player, or as a test case with no players.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The solution may not correctly determine whether a player can win the tournament. For example, the solution may incorrectly assume that a player can win the tournament if they have the highest strength on both maps, even if there are other players who can beat them on one map.
4. **Runtime errors**. The solution may run out of time on large test cases. For example, the solution may use a recursive algorithm to solve the problem, which can be very inefficient for large n.
5. **Memory errors**. The solution may use too much memory on large test cases. For example, the solution may store all of the input data in memory, which can be very inefficient for large n.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test your solution on a variety of test cases, including small test cases, large test cases, and test cases with invalid input.

```

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format in the problem statement is not followed correctly. For example, the input should be a single integer n, followed by n lines of dominoes. However, the following input is incorrect:

```
1
?W
```

This input should be written as follows:

```
1
?W
```

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format in the problem statement is not followed correctly. For example, the output should be a single integer, representing the number of valid ways to color the yet uncolored cells of dominoes. However, the following output is incorrect:

```
10
```

This output should be written as follows:

```
10
```

3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem is incorrect. For example, the following algorithm will not work:

```
def solve(board):
    for i in range(n):
        if (board[i][0] == '?'):
            board[i][0] = 'B'
        if (board[i][1] == '?'):
            board[i][1] = 'W'
    return board
```

This algorithm will not work because it does not consider the fact that the dominoes must be rearranged in some order such that the color of the right cell of the i-th domino is different from the color of the left cell of the ((i mod n)+1)-st domino.

4. **Incorrect use of mod**. The mod operator is used incorrectly in the following code:

```
res = cnt1 * cnt2 % mod
```

The mod operator should be used after the multiplication operation, not before. The correct code should be as follows:

```
res = (cnt1 * cnt2) % mod
```

5. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic**. The modulo operator is used incorrectly in the following code:

```
if (cnt1 == 0):
    res = 1
elif (cnt2 == 0):
    res = 1
else:
    res = cnt1 * cnt2
    res = res % mod
```

The modulo operator should be used after each operation, not after the entire expression. The correct code should be as follows:

```
if (cnt1 == 0):
    res = 1 % mod
elif (cnt2 == 0):
    res = 1 % mod
else:
    res = cnt1 * cnt2 % mod
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 1613_A. Long Comparison

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format of the problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two integers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format of the problem is also very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if you forget to add a newline character at the end of the output, the program will not be accepted.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When comparing two numbers, it's easy to make a mistake and compare the wrong digits. For example, if you compare the numbers 1001 and 1000, you might accidentally compare the first digit (1) instead of the second digit (0).
4. **Arithmetic errors.** When performing arithmetic operations, it's easy to make a mistake and get the wrong answer. For example, if you add two numbers together, you might accidentally add them in the wrong order.
5. **Memory errors.** If you don't allocate enough memory for your program, it might crash. For example, if you try to store a very large number in a variable that is too small, the program might overflow and crash.
6. **Timeout errors.** If your program takes too long to run, it might be timed out. For example, if your program tries to solve a very large problem, it might take too long to finish and be timed out.
7. **Incorrect logic.** Even if your program doesn't have any of the above problems, it might still be incorrect if the logic is wrong. For example, if your program is supposed to find the maximum value in a list, but it accidentally finds the minimum value instead, the program will be incorrect.

To avoid these problems, it's important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It's also important to test your program thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1613_B. Absent Remainder

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a sequence of integers. So, when you store the input data, you should use the `int` data type. However, some developers may mistakenly use the `str` data type. This will cause a type error.

**2. Using the wrong formula**

The problem asks you to find the pairs of integers `x` and `y` such that `x ≠ y`, `x` and `y` appear in `a`, and `x mod y` does not appear in `a`. The formula for finding `x mod y` is `x % y`. However, some developers may mistakenly use the formula `x / y`. This will give you the wrong answer.

**3. Not considering the case where `x mod y` is 0**

The problem states that `x mod y` does not appear in `a`. However, it does not say that `x mod y` cannot be 0. So, you need to consider the case where `x mod y` is 0.

**4. Not considering the case where `x` or `y` is not in `a`**

The problem states that `x` and `y` appear in `a`. However, it does not say that `x` and `y` must be in `a`. So, you need to check if `x` and `y` are in `a` before you try to find their remainders.

**5. Not using the set data structure**

The problem asks you to find `⌊ n / 2 ⌋` different pairs of integers `x` and `y`. This means that you need to find at least `⌊ n / 2 ⌋` pairs of integers `x` and `y`. One way to do this is to use the set data structure. The set data structure allows you to store a collection of unique elements. So, you can use a set to store all of the integers in `a` that are not remainders. Then, you can iterate through the set and find all of the pairs of integers `x` and `y` such that `x` and `y` are in `a` and `x mod y` is not in the set.

**6. Not using the `sorted()` function**

The problem states that the input data is a sequence of integers. So, the integers in `a` are already sorted in ascending order. This means that you can use the `sorted()` function to sort the integers in `a`. This will make it easier to find the pairs of integers `x` and `y` such that `x mod y` is not in `a`.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1613_C. Poisoned Dagger

Pain points:

 **Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement is quite long and detailed, so it is important to read it carefully and make sure that you understand all of the requirements. For example, it is important to note that the poison effect lasts for k seconds, starting with the same second when the dragon was stabbed by the dagger. This means that if the dragon is stabbed multiple times, the poison effect will be applied multiple times, and the total damage dealt will be the sum of the damage dealt by each individual poison effect.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution to this problem involves a number of different steps, and it is important to make sure that each step is implemented correctly. For example, you need to make sure that you are correctly calculating the total damage dealt by each poison effect, and that you are correctly updating the dragon's hit points.
3. **Incorrect test cases.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. This includes testing your solution with a variety of different input values, as well as testing your solution for corner cases. For example, you should test your solution with cases where the dragon has 0 hit points, and cases where the dragon has more hit points than the total damage that can be dealt by the poison effect.
4. **Incorrect debugging.** If your solution is not correct, it is important to be able to debug your code to find the source of the error. This can be difficult, but there are a number of tools and techniques that can help you debug your code. For example, you can use a debugger to step through your code line by line, and you can use print statements to print out the values of variables at different points in your code.

**Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrectly calculating the total damage dealt by each poison effect.** For example, you might forget to add the damage dealt by the previous poison effect to the total damage dealt by the current poison effect.
* **Incorrectly updating the dragon's hit points.** For example, you might accidentally decrease the dragon's hit points by more than the total damage dealt by the poison effect.
* **Incorrect test cases.** For example, you might test your solution with a case where the dragon has 0 hit points, but your solution does not handle this case correctly.
* **Incorrect debugging.** For example, you might not be able to identify the source of the error in your code, even after using a debugger and print statements.

CODEFORCES 1613_D. MEX Sequences

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the MEX function.** The MEX function should return the minimum non-negative integer that does not belong to the set `x_1, ..., x_k`. However, a common mistake is to return the minimum integer in the set `x_1, ..., x_k`. This will result in incorrect answers for some test cases.
2. **Incorrect handling of duplicate elements in the input array.** The problem statement specifies that two subsequences are considered different if their sequences of indices are not the same. However, a common mistake is to ignore duplicate elements in the input array when computing the number of subsequences. This will result in incorrect answers for some test cases.
3. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The problem statement specifies that the output should be printed modulo `998244353`. However, a common mistake is to forget to use the modulo operator when computing the output. This will result in incorrect answers for some test cases.
4. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The problem statement specifies that the input array can contain integers up to `5 * 10^5`. However, a common mistake is to use an integer type that is not large enough to store these integers. This will result in incorrect answers for some test cases.
5. **Incorrect use of the `cin` and `cout` functions.** The `cin` and `cout` functions are used to read and write input and output from the standard input and output streams. However, a common mistake is to use these functions incorrectly. This can result in incorrect answers for some test cases, or in the program crashing.

**2. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm for solving this problem is not very straightforward. It requires the developer to reason about the possible movements of the robot and the effects of different commands. One possible bug is that the developer might implement an incorrect algorithm, resulting in an incorrect solution.

**3. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also not very clear. It is not immediately obvious how to represent the cells that the robot can be forced to reach the lab from. One possible bug is that the developer might not correctly format the output, resulting in a solution that is not accepted by the judge.

**4. Runtime errors**

The code for this problem could potentially have runtime errors. For example, the developer might not correctly handle edge cases or might use an inefficient algorithm. These runtime errors could cause the code to crash or to run very slowly.

**5. Memory errors**

CODEFORCES 1613_F. Tree Coloring

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly and in the correct format. One common mistake is to forget to read the number of vertices as the first line of input. Another common mistake is to read the edges as two integers per line, when they should actually be read as one integer per line.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer. It is important to make sure that you are printing the output correctly and in the correct format. One common mistake is to print the output as a list of integers, when it should actually be printed as a single integer. Another common mistake is to print the output with a newline character at the end, when it should not have a newline character.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the number of beautiful colorings**

The number of beautiful colorings can be calculated using a dynamic programming approach. However, it is important to make sure that you are implementing the dynamic programming algorithm correctly. One common mistake is to forget to add the base case to the dynamic programming table. Another common mistake is to make a mistake in the recursive formula for the dynamic programming table.

**4. Incorrect modulo operation**

The answer to this problem should be printed modulo 998244353. It is important to make sure that you are performing the modulo operation correctly. One common mistake is to forget to perform the modulo operation. Another common mistake is to use the wrong modulo operation.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect array traversal.** The array should be traversed from the leftmost element to the rightmost element. If the array is traversed in the opposite direction, the wrong answer may be returned.
2. **Incorrect bitwise AND operation.** The bitwise AND operation is performed on two equal-length binary representations. If the two binary representations are not of equal length, the wrong answer may be returned.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of elements to delete.** The minimum number of elements to delete is the number of elements in the array that are equal to 0. If this number is not calculated correctly, the wrong answer may be returned.
4. **Incorrect output.** The output should be a single integer, which is the minimum number of elements to delete. If the output is not a single integer, or if it is not the minimum number of elements to delete, the wrong answer may be returned.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1615_E. Purple Crayon

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the DFS traversal**

The DFS traversal is a recursive algorithm that visits all the nodes in a tree. In this problem, we need to use DFS to find all the leaf nodes in the tree. However, if the implementation of the DFS traversal is incorrect, it may miss some leaf nodes or visit some nodes multiple times. This will lead to incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the score**

The score of the game is calculated as follows:

```
score = w * (r - b)
```

where w is the number of white nodes, r is the number of red nodes, and b is the number of blue nodes. If the calculation of any of these values is incorrect, it will lead to incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect choice of the subtree to color**

Red wants to maximize the score of the game, so he should choose the subtree that contains the most white nodes. Blue wants to minimize the score of the game, so he should choose the subtree that contains the most red nodes. If the choice of the subtree is incorrect, it will lead to incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm**

The greedy algorithm is an algorithm that makes locally optimal choices at each step in order to achieve a globally optimal solution. In this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm to find the subtree that Red should color. The greedy algorithm works as follows:

1. Start with the root node of the tree.
2. If the node is red, skip it.
3. If the node is white, color it red and add it to the set of red nodes.
4. For each of the node's children, recursively apply the greedy algorithm.

The greedy algorithm will find the subtree that contains the most white nodes. However, if the implementation of the greedy algorithm is incorrect, it may not find the optimal solution.

**5. Incorrect implementation of the backtracking algorithm**

The backtracking algorithm is an algorithm that recursively explores all possible solutions to a problem. In this problem, we can use a backtracking algorithm to find the subtree that Blue should color. The backtracking algorithm works as follows:

1. Start with the root node of the tree.
2. If the node is blue, skip it.
3. If the node is white, color it blue and add it to the set of blue nodes.
4. For each of the node's children, recursively apply the backtracking algorithm.

The backtracking algorithm will find all possible subtrees that Blue can color. However, if the implementation of the backtracking algorithm is incorrect, it may not find all the possible solutions.

 * (100, 000) — takes 2 operations. 

 1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect variable types**. The program may not be able to handle variables of the wrong type. For example, if a variable is declared as an integer but is assigned a string, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program may contain errors in its logic, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program does not correctly account for all possible cases, it may produce incorrect results.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. These errors occur when the program misses or adds one element when iterating through a list or array. For example, if the program is supposed to iterate through a list of five elements, but it only iterates through four elements, it will miss the last element and produce an incorrect result.
5. **Memory leaks**. These errors occur when the program allocates memory but does not release it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions**. These errors occur when two or more parts of the program try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results or crashing.
7. **Deadlocks**. These errors occur when two or more parts of the program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish because it is waiting for the other. This can lead to the program running indefinitely or crashing.
8. **Stack overflows**. These errors occur when the program calls a function so many times that it runs out of stack space. This can lead to the program crashing.
9. **Buffer overflows**. These errors occur when the program writes data to a buffer that is not large enough. This can lead to the program overwriting other data in memory, which can lead to security vulnerabilities or crashes.
10. **Format string vulnerabilities**. These vulnerabilities occur when the program uses a format string that is not properly sanitized. This can lead to the program executing arbitrary code, which can lead to security vulnerabilities or crashes.

CODEFORCES 1615_G. Maximum Adjacent Pairs

Pain points:
**1. Not handling the case where all the elements are 0.**

In this case, the output should be n * (n + 1) / 2, where n is the number of elements in the array.

**2. Not handling the case where there are no 0s in the array.**

In this case, the output should be the array itself.

**3. Using a incorrect algorithm to find the maximum possible value.**

One possible incorrect algorithm is to sort the array and then output the elements in order. This algorithm will not always give the maximum possible value, because it does not take into account the fact that we can swap adjacent elements.

**4. Using a incorrect algorithm to find the adjacent pairs.**

One possible incorrect algorithm is to iterate over the array and check for each pair of adjacent elements if they are equal. This algorithm will not always give the correct answer, because it does not take into account the fact that we can swap adjacent elements.

**5. Not handling the case where the input is not valid.**

The input should be a non-negative integer. If the input is not a non-negative integer, the program should terminate with an error.

CODEFORCES 1615_H. Reindeer Games

Pain points:
**Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs That a Developer May Encounter When Solving This Problem**

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**

The input format for this problem is not very straightforward, and it is easy to make mistakes when reading in the data. For example, it is important to make sure that you correctly parse the number of reindeer and requirements, and that you correctly parse the scores of the reindeer and the requirements.

2. **Incorrect Implementation of the Algorithm**

The algorithm for solving this problem is not very difficult, but it is important to make sure that you implement it correctly. For example, it is important to make sure that you correctly update the scores of the reindeer after each operation, and that you correctly check whether all of the requirements are satisfied.

3. **Incorrect Output**

The output for this problem is also not very straightforward, and it is easy to make mistakes when printing the scores of the reindeer. For example, it is important to make sure that you print the scores in the correct order, and that you print the scores with the correct format.

4. **Runtime Errors**

This problem can be solved in O(n log n) time, but it is important to make sure that your algorithm is actually running in this time complexity. For example, it is important to make sure that you are not using any inefficient data structures or algorithms.

5. **Memory Errors**

This problem does not require a lot of memory, but it is important to make sure that your program does not run out of memory. For example, it is important to make sure that you are not allocating too much memory for temporary variables.
Test inputs:

Title:
CODEFORCES 1617_A. Forbidden Subsequence

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input strings are given as strings, but the output string should be a permutation of the input string. A permutation is a rearrangement of the characters in the string, so the output string should be a string of characters. If you accidentally use the wrong data type for the output string, such as an integer or a float, your program will not produce the correct output.

**2. Not handling the case where T is a substring of S**

The problem statement states that T is a permutation of the string abc. This means that T must contain all three letters of the alphabet, a, b, and c. If T is a substring of S, then S must also contain all three letters of the alphabet. In this case, the lexicographically smallest permutation of S that does not contain T is the same as the lexicographically smallest permutation of S.

**3. Not handling the case where S is empty**

The problem statement does not explicitly state that S can be empty, but it is possible for S to be empty. If S is empty, then the output string should also be empty.

**4. Not handling the case where T is not a permutation of abc**

The problem statement states that T is a permutation of the string abc. However, it is possible for T to not be a permutation of abc. In this case, the output string should be the same as the input string.

**5. Not handling the case where T is not a subsequence of S**

The problem statement states that T is not a subsequence of S. However, it is possible for T to be a subsequence of S. In this case, the output string should be the same as the input string.

CODEFORCES 1617_B. GCD Problem

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong formula for GCD**

The GCD of two integers a and b is defined as the largest integer that divides both a and b. The following formula can be used to find the GCD of a and b:

```
GCD(a, b) = a * b / LCM(a, b)
```

However, this formula is incorrect if either a or b is 0. In this case, the GCD of a and b is simply 0.

**2. Not handling negative integers correctly**

The GCD of two negative integers is the same as the GCD of their absolute values. For example, the GCD of -3 and -4 is 4. However, some programming languages do not support negative integers, so it is important to check if the input integers are negative before using the GCD formula.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

There are many different algorithms for finding the GCD of two integers. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. It is important to choose an algorithm that is appropriate for the size of the input integers.

**4. Overflow errors**

When computing the GCD of two large integers, it is possible to encounter overflow errors. This can happen if the intermediate results of the computation are too large to be represented by the computer's data type. To avoid overflow errors, it is important to use a data type that is large enough to represent the intermediate results.

**5. Rounding errors**

When computing the GCD of two floating-point numbers, it is possible to encounter rounding errors. This can happen if the floating-point numbers are not exactly representable by the computer's floating-point format. To avoid rounding errors, it is important to use a floating-point format that has a high enough precision.

**6. Using the wrong data type**

It is important to use the correct data type when computing the GCD of two integers. If the data type is too small, it is possible to lose precision and get incorrect results. If the data type is too large, it is possible to waste memory and slow down the computation.

**7. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

There are many different algorithms for computing the GCD of two integers. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. It is important to choose an algorithm that is appropriate for the size of the input integers and the available computing resources.

**8. Not handling special cases correctly**

There are a few special cases that need to be handled correctly when computing the GCD of two integers. For example, the GCD of two equal integers is simply the integer itself. The GCD of two coprime integers is 1. The GCD of a negative integer and a positive integer is the absolute value of the negative integer.
Test inputs:
```
# 1. Using the wrong formula for GCD

def gcd(a, b):
  return a * b / lcm(a, b)

def lcm(a, b):

def gcd(a, b):
  return a * b / lcm(a, b)

This program will output an error, because the floating-point numbers are not exactly representable by the computer's floating-point format.

```
# 6. Using the wrong data type

```
n = 10

def gcd(a, b):
  return a * b / lcm(a, b)

def lcm(a, b):

CODEFORCES 1617_C. Paprika and Permutation

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of data types**

The input and output data types are not specified in the problem statement. A developer may incorrectly assume that the input and output are integers, and then make mistakes when dealing with floating-point numbers.

For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
def solve(n, a):
    # Calculate the minimum number of operations needed to make the array a permutation of integers from 1 to n.

    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        # Subtract 1 from each element of the array to make it a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1.

        a[i] -= 1
        # Find the smallest element in the array.

        min_val = min(a)
        # Increment the count by the number of elements that are greater than the smallest element.

        count += sum(a > min_val)
    return count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(solve(n, a))
```

The problem with this code is that the input data is a list of floating-point numbers, but the code treats it as a list of integers. This causes the following errors:

* The `min()` function returns the smallest element in the list, which is a floating-point number. This causes the `sum()` function to raise an error.
* The `count` variable is incremented by the number of elements in the list that are greater than the smallest element. This is incorrect, because the smallest element is a floating-point number, not an integer.

To fix this code, we need to convert the input data to a list of integers. We can do this using the `int()` function:

```
def solve(n, a):
    # Calculate the minimum number of operations needed to make the array a permutation of integers from 1 to n.

    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        # Subtract 1 from each element of the array to make it a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1.

        a[i] -= 1
        # Find the smallest element in the array.

        min_val = min(int(a) for a in a)
        # Increment the count by the number of elements that are greater than the smallest element.

        count += sum(int(a) > min_val for a in a)
    return count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(solve(n, a))
```

This code now works correctly.

**2. Incorrect use of algorithms**

The developer may incorrectly use an algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the following code uses a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem:

```
def solve(n, a):
    # Calculate the minimum number of operations needed to make the array a permutation of integers from 1 to n.

    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        # Iterate over all possible values of x.

        for x in range(1, n+1):
            # Calculate the number of elements in the array that are divisible by x.

            count_div = sum(a[i] % x == 0 for i in range(n))
            # If all elements in the array are divisible by x, then we can perform an operation to make the array a permutation of integers from 1 to n.

            if count_div == n:
                # Perform the operation.

                for i in range(n):
                    a[i] //= x
                return count + 1
    return -1

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(solve(n, a))
```

This algorithm takes a long time to run, even for small values of n. A more efficient algorithm can be used to solve this problem.

**3. Incorrect use of data structures**

The developer may incorrectly use a data structure to store the input data. For example, the following code uses a list
Test inputs:

Title:
CODEFORCES 1618_A. Polycarp and Sums of Subsequences

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It requires that the first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) which is the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line which contains 7 integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_7 (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; b_i ≤ b_{i+1}). If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will likely crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also very specific. It requires that for each test case, you print 3 integers — a_1, a_2 and a_3. If there can be several answers, you can print any of them. If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will likely receive a WA (wrong answer) verdict.

**3. Insufficient test cases**

When debugging a program, it is important to test it with a variety of different input values. This will help you to identify any bugs that may be present in your code. For this problem, it is especially important to test with input values that are close to the limits of the constraints. For example, you should test with input values that are equal to the maximum and minimum allowed values.

**4. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm that you use to solve this problem is very important. If you use an incorrect algorithm, your program will not be able to find the correct answer and will likely receive a WA verdict. There are a few different ways to solve this problem, but one simple approach is to use a dynamic programming algorithm.

**5. Incorrect data structures**

The data structures that you use to solve this problem can also have a significant impact on the performance of your program. For this problem, it is important to use data structures that are efficient for the operations that you need to perform. For example, you will need to be able to quickly find the smallest and largest elements in the array b.

**6. Inefficient code**

Even if you use the correct algorithm and data structures, your program may still be inefficient if your code is not written efficiently. There are a few things that you can do to improve the efficiency of your code, such as using vectorization and avoiding unnecessary loops.

**7. Uncaught exceptions**

If your program throws an uncaught exception, it will likely crash and you will receive a WA verdict. It is important to make sure that your program handles all possible exceptions gracefully.

**8. Memory leaks**

If your program leaks memory, it will eventually run out of memory and crash. This can also cause your program to receive a WA verdict. It is important to make sure that your program frees up any memory that it no longer needs.

**9. Incorrect logic**

Even if your program is correct in terms of syntax and semantics, it may still contain errors in its logic. This can lead to your program producing incorrect output and receiving a WA verdict. It is important to carefully check your logic to make sure that it is correct.

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line of each test case should contain a single integer n, and the second line should contain n-2 bigrams separated by a single space. However, the input may contain an incorrect number of lines, or the bigrams may not be separated by a single space.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the output should be a single word, consisting of n letters, each of which should be either 'a' or 'b'. However, the output may contain the wrong number of letters, or the letters may not be all lowercase.
3. **Incorrect solution.** The solution may not find the correct word, or it may find a word that is not a valid answer to the problem.
4. **Runtime errors.** The solution may run out of time or memory, or it may cause a segmentation fault.

### Possible Bugs

1. **Off-by-one errors.** The solution may incorrectly count the number of bigrams in the input, or it may incorrectly index the bigrams when trying to reconstruct the original word.
2. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The solution may use data structures that are not appropriate for the problem, or it may use the data structures incorrectly.
3. **Logic errors.** The solution may have incorrect logic for finding the missing bigram or for reconstructing the original word.
4. **Incorrect error handling.** The solution may not handle errors correctly, which could lead to incorrect results or runtime errors.

## How to Avoid These Problems

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement and the input format. It is also important to test the solution thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly for all possible inputs.

Here are some specific tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use a language that is well-suited for the problem. For example, a functional language like Haskell or Scala may be a good choice for this problem, as it makes it easy to write concise and efficient code.

CODEFORCES 1618_G. Trader Problem

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem states that the first line should contain three integers n, m and q, where 1 ≤ n, m, q ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. However, if the input contains more or less than three integers, or if any of the integers is out of the specified range, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem states that for each query, the program should print one integer - the maximum possible total cost of items Monocarp can have after some sequence of trades, given the value of k from the query. However, if the program prints more or less than one integer, or if the integer is not an integer, the program will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem must be correct in order for the program to produce the correct output. There are a number of ways to solve this problem, but some algorithms are more efficient than others. For example, a brute-force algorithm that simply tries every possible combination of trades would be very inefficient, while a more efficient algorithm would use dynamic programming to find the optimal solution.
4. **Incorrect data structures**. The data structures used to store the input data and the intermediate results must be correct in order for the program to produce the correct output. For example, if the program uses a data structure that is too small to store all of the input data, or if the data structures are not initialized correctly, the program will crash.
5. **Incorrect error handling**. The program must be able to handle errors gracefully. For example, if the program encounters an error while reading the input data, it should print an error message and exit gracefully.
6. **Incorrect testing**. The program must be tested thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. This includes testing the program with a variety of input data, as well as testing for edge cases and special cases.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs that developers may encounter when solving this problem.

CODEFORCES 1619_B. Squares and Cubes

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect formula**

The formula for the number of integers from 1 to n that are perfect squares is ```n * (n + 1) / 2```. However, this formula is incorrect for n < 4. For example, the number of perfect squares from 1 to 3 is 2, not 3.

To avoid this problem, you can use the following formula:

```
n * (n + 1) / 2 - (n % 2)
```

This formula will always give the correct number of perfect squares from 1 to n, even for n < 4.

**2. Using an incorrect formula for the number of integers from 1 to n that are perfect cubes**

The formula for the number of integers from 1 to n that are perfect cubes is ```n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 6```. However, this formula is incorrect for n < 3. For example, the number of perfect cubes from 1 to 2 is 1, not 2.

To avoid this problem, you can use the following formula:

```
n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 6 - (n % 3)
```

This formula will always give the correct number of perfect cubes from 1 to n, even for n < 3.

**3. Using an incorrect formula for the number of integers from 1 to n that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes**

The formula for the number of integers from 1 to n that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes is ```n / 6```. However, this formula is incorrect for n < 6. For example, the number of integers from 1 to 5 that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes is 2, not 3.

To avoid this problem, you can use the following formula:

```
n / 6 - (n % 6)
```

This formula will always give the correct number of integers from 1 to n that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes, even for n < 6.

**4. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem is using an incorrect algorithm. The correct algorithm for solving this problem is as follows:

1. Find the largest perfect square that is less than or equal to n.
2. Find the largest perfect cube that is less than or equal to n.
3. Add the number of integers from 1 to the largest perfect square that are perfect squares, the number of integers from 1 to the largest perfect cube that are perfect cubes, and the number of integers from the largest perfect square to the largest perfect cube that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes.

This algorithm will always give the correct answer, even for large values of n.

CODEFORCES 1619_C. Wrong Addition

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly followed, which may lead to the program crashing or giving incorrect output. For example, if the input contains a letter instead of a number, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect variable type**. The variable type may not be correct for the data it is storing. For example, storing a number in a string variable will cause the program to crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, which will lead to incorrect output. For example, if the program is supposed to add two numbers but it subtracts them instead, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the programmer makes a mistake in counting or indexing. For example, if the programmer is supposed to iterate through a list of numbers from 0 to 9, but they start at 1, they will miss the number 0.
5. **Infinite loops**. Infinite loops occur when the program enters a loop that never terminates. This can happen if the programmer makes a mistake in the loop condition or if the loop body does not contain any code that will eventually terminate the loop.
6. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when the program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
7. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
8. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, but neither thread can do so. This can eventually lead to the program running out of resources and crashing.
9. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can occur when the program is not properly protected from malicious attacks. This can allow attackers to gain access to the program's data or to control the program's execution.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully follow the input format, use the correct variable types, check the logic of the program, and test the program thoroughly. It is also important to be aware of the common problems that can occur and to take steps to prevent them.

### Possible problems

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correctly parsed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is a list of integers instead of a list of strings, the program may misinterpret the input and produce incorrect results.
* **Incorrect data type:** The data type of the input may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is a string instead of an integer, the program may misinterpret the input and produce incorrect results.
* **Incorrect algorithm:** The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the algorithm uses a brute-force approach to solve the problem, it may take a long time to run and produce incorrect results.
* **Incorrect implementation:** The implementation of the algorithm may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the implementation contains a bug, it may produce incorrect results.

### Possible bugs

* **Off-by-one error:** An off-by-one error occurs when a programmer makes a mistake in counting, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if a programmer writes a loop that iterates over a list of integers, but the loop starts at index 0 instead of index 1, the loop will skip the first element of the list and produce incorrect results.
* **Index out of bounds error:** An index out of bounds error occurs when a programmer attempts to access an element of an array or list that does not exist, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if a programmer attempts to access the element at index 10 of an array that only has 9 elements, the program will crash and produce incorrect results.
* **Null pointer exception:** A null pointer exception occurs when a programmer attempts to dereference a null pointer, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if a programmer attempts to access the value of a variable that has been set to null, the program will crash and produce incorrect results.
* **Arithmetic overflow error:** An arithmetic overflow error occurs when a programmer performs an arithmetic operation that results in a number that is too large to be represented by the data type, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if a programmer attempts to divide a number by zero, the program will crash and produce incorrect results.

CODEFORCES 1619_E. MEX and Increments

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect array indexing**. When iterating over the array, make sure to use the correct index. For example, `a[i]` accesses the element at index `i`, not the element at index `i + 1`.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. When calculating the size of an array or the number of elements in a set, make sure to add 1 to account for the first element. For example, if you are iterating over an array of size `n`, the last element will be at index `n - 1`, not `n`.
3. **Incorrect use of pointers**. When using pointers, make sure to dereference them before you use them. For example, `*p` accesses the value at the address pointed to by `p`, not the address itself.
4. **Memory leaks**. When you allocate memory, make sure to free it when you are finished with it. Otherwise, you will leak memory and your program will eventually run out of memory.
5. **Incorrect data types**. Make sure to use the correct data types for your variables. For example, if you are storing integers, use the `int` data type, not the `char` data type.
6. **Logical errors**. Make sure that your code is logically correct. For example, if you are checking if a condition is true, make sure that you are using the correct operator.
7. **Off-by-two errors**. When calculating the difference between two numbers, make sure to add 1 to the second number to account for the carry. For example, if you are subtracting `10` from `9`, the difference is `1`, not `-1`.

CODEFORCES 1619_F. Let's Play the Hat?

Pain points:
```
Possible problems:

1. The input format is not clear. For example, it is not clear what the difference between "n" and "m" is.
2. The output format is not clear. For example, it is not clear how to represent a table with multiple players.
3. The problem statement is not clear. For example, it is not clear what it means for a schedule to be "fair".
4. The time complexity of the solution is not clear.
5. The space complexity of the solution is not clear.

Possible bugs:

1. The solution may not work correctly for all input cases.
2. The solution may be too slow for large input cases.
3. The solution may use too much memory for large input cases.

Here are some suggestions for how to avoid these problems:

1. Make sure the input format is clear and concise.
2. Make sure the output format is clear and concise.
3. Make sure the problem statement is clear and concise.
4. Make sure the time complexity of the solution is efficient.
5. Make sure the space complexity of the solution is efficient.

Here is an example of a possible solution to this problem:

```

Title:
CODEFORCES 1619_G. Unusual Minesweeper

Pain points:

 **Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect data type.** The input data contains a lot of numbers, so it is important to use the correct data type to store them. For example, if you use `int` to store the coordinates of a mine, you may get an overflow error when the coordinates are too large.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When you are iterating over a list of mines, it is easy to make an off-by-one error and miss a mine. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic for finding the minimum number of seconds to detonate all the mines is not trivial. It is important to make sure that you understand the problem correctly and that your solution is correct.
4. **Memory leaks.** When you are creating a lot of objects, it is important to make sure that you delete them when you are finished with them. Otherwise, you may run out of memory.
5. **Timeouts.** If your solution is too slow, it may time out during the competition. Make sure that your solution is efficient enough to pass the time limit.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

* Use the correct data types for your data.
* Use a debugger to check your code for off-by-one errors.
* Write your code carefully and make sure that you understand the problem and the solution.
* Use a memory manager to avoid memory leaks.
* Test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct and efficient.

CODEFORCES 1619_H. Permutation and Queries

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or the number of elements in the input may not match the number of elements in the permutation.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not strictly followed. For example, the output may contain a number that is not an integer, or the number of elements in the output may not match the number of queries.

**3. Malformed input data**

The input data may be malformed. For example, the input may contain two permutations that are not disjoint, or the input may contain a permutation that contains duplicate elements.

**4. Incorrect implementation**

The implementation of the algorithm may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not correctly swap two elements in the permutation, or the algorithm may not correctly calculate the value of i after k iterations.

**5. Runtime errors**

The algorithm may run into runtime errors. For example, the algorithm may run out of memory, or the algorithm may take too long to run.

**6. Incorrect solution**

The algorithm may not correctly solve the problem. For example, the algorithm may output the wrong answer for some of the queries.

# Explanation

In the first example, the input is a permutation of 5 elements. The first query is to swap the elements at positions 3 and 1. This results in the permutation \{5, 4, 2, 1, 3\}. The second query is to print the value of p_{p_1}. This is the same as the value of p_5, which is 5. The third query is to swap the elements at positions 1 and 3. This results in the permutation \{4, 3, 5, 2, 1\}. The fourth query is to print the value of p_{p_1}. This is the same as the value of p_4, which is 4.

# Test cases

```
# Test case 1

n = 5
q = 4
p = [5, 3, 4, 2, 1]

Title:
CODEFORCES 1620_A. Equal or Not Equal

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type for the array.** The input specifies that the array should contain positive integers less than or equal to 10^9. However, if you declare the array as a `int` array, it will only be able to store integers up to 2^31 - 1. This could lead to an overflow error if you try to store an integer greater than 2^31 - 1 in the array.
2. **Using an incorrect data type for the string.** The input specifies that the string should contain only the characters `E` and `N`. However, if you declare the string as a `char` array, it will be able to store any character, including characters that are not `E` or `N`. This could lead to a logic error if you try to compare the string to the characters `E` and `N`.
3. **Not handling the case where the string is empty.** The input specifies that the string should not be empty. However, if you do not check for this condition, your code will crash when it tries to access the first character of the string.
4. **Not handling the case where the string contains duplicate characters.** The input specifies that the string should not contain duplicate characters. However, if you do not check for this condition, your code could produce incorrect results.
5. **Not handling the case where the string contains characters other than `E` and `N`.** The input specifies that the string should only contain the characters `E` and `N`. However, if you do not check for this condition, your code could produce incorrect results.
6. **Not handling the case where the string is not a palindrome.** The input specifies that the string should be a palindrome. However, if you do not check for this condition, your code could produce incorrect results.
7. **Not handling the case where the string is not a circular permutation of the integers 1 to n.** The input specifies that the string should be a circular permutation of the integers 1 to n. However, if you do not check for this condition, your code could produce incorrect results.

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correct. For example, the input may not have the correct number of lines, or the values in the input may not be of the correct type.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correct. For example, the output may not have the correct number of digits, or the values in the output may not be of the correct type.
* **Incorrect algorithm:** The algorithm may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not find the maximum area of a triangle, or the algorithm may find the maximum area of a triangle that does not satisfy the given constraints.
* **Incorrect implementation:** The implementation of the algorithm may be incorrect. For example, the implementation may have a bug that causes the algorithm to crash, or the implementation may not run in time.
* **Incorrect test cases:** The test cases may not be correct. For example, the test cases may not test all of the possible cases, or the test cases may be biased in favor of a particular solution.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to carefully design and implement the algorithm. Finally, it is important to test the algorithm thoroughly with a variety of test cases.

CODEFORCES 1620_D. Exact Change

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the input values.** The input values are integers, so they should be stored in an integer data type. Using a floating-point data type could lead to rounding errors, which could cause the program to produce incorrect results.
2. **Not handling invalid input values.** The input may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers that are too large. The program should handle these invalid values gracefully, such as by printing an error message and exiting.
3. **Not using the most efficient algorithm.** The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm, which is very efficient. Using a more complex algorithm, such as a dynamic programming algorithm, would not be necessary and would only slow down the program.
4. **Not testing the program thoroughly.** It is important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly for all possible input values. This includes testing for invalid input values, boundary cases, and special cases.
5. **Not using comments to document the code.** It is important to use comments to document the code so that other developers can understand what the code is doing. This will help to make the code more maintainable and easier to debug.
6. **Not using a consistent coding style.** It is important to use a consistent coding style so that the code is easy to read and understand. This includes using the same indentation style, naming conventions, and commenting style throughout the code.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Using a floating-point data type for the input values.** This could lead to rounding errors, which could cause the program to produce incorrect results. For example, if the input value is 1337, and the program uses a floating-point data type with a precision of 3 decimals, the value will be rounded to 1337.000, which is not the correct answer.
* **Not handling invalid input values.** The input may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers that are too large. The program should handle these invalid values gracefully, such as by printing an error message and exiting. For example, if the input value is -1, the program should print an error message and exit.
* **Not using the most efficient algorithm.** The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm, which is very efficient. Using a more complex algorithm, such as a dynamic programming algorithm, would not be necessary and would only slow down the program. For example, the following greedy algorithm can be used to solve the problem:

```
1. Sort the input values in ascending order.
2. Starting from the smallest value, add coins to the total until the total is greater than or equal to the target value.
3. The number of coins added is the minimum number of coins needed to make exact change for the target value.
```

* **Not testing the program thoroughly.** It is important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly for all possible input values. This includes testing for invalid input values, boundary cases, and special cases. For example, the following test cases should be included in the test suite:

```
Test Case 1:
Input:
1
1337
Output:
446

Test Case 2:
Input:
3
10 8 10

1 2 3 4 5
Output:

Test Case 4:
Input:

7 77 777
Output:

```

* **Not using a consistent coding style.** It is important to use a consistent coding style so that the code is easy to read and understand. This includes using the same indentation style, naming conventions, and commenting style throughout the code. For example, the following code uses a consistent coding style:

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int t, n;
    scanf(" %d ", &t);
    for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
        scanf(" %d ", &n);
        int arr[n];
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            scanf(" %d ", &arr[j]);
        }
        int ans = 0;
        int i = n - 1;
        while (i >= 0) {
            ans += arr[i] / 3;
            arr[i] %= 3;
            i--;

CODEFORCES 1620_E. Replace the Numbers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, a query may contain more than two numbers, or a number may be negative.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not always correctly followed. For example, the output may contain more than one line, or a number may be negative.
3. **Incorrect data type.** The input and output data may be of the wrong type. For example, a number may be represented as a string.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** The developer may forget to add or remove one element from the array.
5. **Incorrect algorithm.** The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the developer may use a linear search algorithm to find an element in an array when a binary search algorithm would be more efficient.
6. **Memory leaks.** The developer may not free up memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory overflow.
7. **Race conditions.** The developer may not use locks to protect shared data from being accessed by multiple threads at the same time. This can lead to data corruption.
8. **Security vulnerabilities.** The developer may not properly sanitize user input. This can lead to a malicious user being able to execute arbitrary code on the server.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1620_F. Bipartite Array

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is not very strict. However, there are a few things that you need to keep in mind. First, the first line of the input should contain a single integer t, which represents the number of test cases. Each test case should start with a single integer n, which represents the size of the permutation. The second line of each test case should contain n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n, which represent the elements of the permutation.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format for this problem is also not very strict. However, there are a few things that you need to keep in mind. First, the first line of the output should contain a single string "YES" or "NO", which indicates whether or not a bipartite array exists. If a bipartite array exists, the second line of the output should contain n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, which represent the elements of the bipartite array.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm that you use to solve this problem must be correct. There are a few different ways to solve this problem, but the most common approach is to use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. DFS is a recursive algorithm that starts at a single vertex in the graph and explores all of the vertices that are reachable from that vertex. If a vertex is not reachable from the starting vertex, then the graph is not bipartite.
4. **Incorrect data structures**. The data structures that you use to solve this problem must be appropriate for the problem. For this problem, you will need to use a data structure to represent the graph and a data structure to store the results of your DFS traversal.
5. **Incorrect runtime**. The runtime of your solution must be efficient. The best possible runtime for this problem is O(n), where n is the size of the permutation.
6. **Incorrect memory usage**. The memory usage of your solution must be efficient. The best possible memory usage for this problem is O(n), where n is the size of the permutation.

CODEFORCES 1620_G. Subsequences Galore

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the f(s) function.** The f(s) function should count the number of different strings that are subsequences of at least one string t_i. A common mistake is to only count the number of strings that are subsequences of the specific string s.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the XOR of the 2^n integers.** The XOR of a set of integers is the unique integer that does not appear in the set. A common mistake is to calculate the XOR of the integers in the wrong order, or to forget to take into account the modulo operation.

**3. Incorrect handling of the empty string.** The empty string is a subsequence of every string, so the f(s) function should return 1 for the empty string. A common mistake is to return 0 for the empty string.

**4. Incorrect handling of strings that contain duplicate characters.** A string that contains duplicate characters can be a subsequence of multiple strings. A common mistake is to only count the string once when calculating the f(s) function.

**5. Incorrect handling of strings that are not sorted.** The problem statement specifies that the strings in the input are sorted. A common mistake is to not check that the strings are sorted before calculating the f(s) function.

**6. Incorrect use of the modulo operation.** The modulo operation is used to ensure that the output of the f(s) function is a non-negative integer. A common mistake is to forget to use the modulo operation, or to use the wrong modulus.

**7. Incorrect use of the xor operation.** The xor operation is used to calculate the XOR of the 2^n integers. A common mistake is to use the wrong xor operation, or to forget to take into account the modulo operation.

**8. Incorrect use of the 1-indexed indices.** The problem statement specifies that the indices of the subsequences are 1-indexed. A common mistake is to use 0-indexed indices.

**9. Incorrect use of the big integer library.** The problem statement specifies that the output should be modulo 998244353. A common mistake is to not use the big integer library to handle large integers.
Test inputs:
1. ```
n = int(input())

ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    s = input()
    ans += len(s)

print(ans)
```

This code will not work because it does not correctly implement the f(s) function. The f(s) function should count the number of different strings that are subsequences of at least one string t_i, not the number of characters in the string s.

2. ```
n = int(input())

ans = 0
for i in range(2**n):
    s = ''
    for j in range(n):
        if (i >> j) & 1:
            s += input()
    ans ^= f(s)

print(ans)
```

This code will not work because it does not correctly calculate the XOR of the 2^n integers. The XOR of a set of integers is the unique integer that does not appear in the set, not the sum of the integers.

3. ```
n = int(input())

def f(s):
    if len(s) == 0:
        return 1
    return 0

ans = 0
for i in range(2**n):
    s = ''
    for j in range(n):
        if (i >> j) & 1:
            s += input()
    ans ^= f(s)

print(ans)
```

This code will not work because it does not correctly handle the empty string. The empty string is a subsequence of every string, so the f(s) function should return 1 for the empty string.

4. ```
n = int(input())

def f(s):
    if len(s) == 0:
        return 1
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s in input():
            count += 1
    return count

ans = 0
for i in range(2**n):
    s = ''
    for j in range(n):
        if (i >> j) & 1:
            s += input()
    ans ^= f(s)

print(ans)
```

This code will not work because it does not correctly handle strings that contain duplicate characters. A string that contains duplicate characters can be a subsequence of multiple strings, so the f(s) function should count the string once for each string that it is a subsequence of.

5. ```
n = int(input())

def f(s):
    if len(s) == 0:
        return 1
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s == input():
            count += 1
    return count

ans = 0
for i in range(2**n):
    s = ''
    for j in range(n):
        if (i >> j) & 1:
            s += input()
    ans ^= f(s)

print(ans)
```

This code will not work because it does not correctly handle strings that are not sorted. The problem statement specifies that the strings in the input are sorted, so the f(s) function should only be called on strings that are sorted.

6. ```
n = int(input())

def f(s):
    if len(s) == 0:
        return 1
    return s.count('a') + s.count('b') + ... + s.count('z')

ans = 0
for i in range(2**n):
    s = ''
    for j in range(n):
        if (i >> j) & 1:
            s += input()
    ans ^= f(s)

print(ans % 998244353)
```

This code will not work because it does not correctly use the modulo operation. The modulo operation is used to ensure that the output of the f(s) function is a non-negative integer, but this code does not use the modulo operation.

CODEFORCES 1622_A. Construct a Rectangle

Pain points:
**1. Input format**

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains three integers l_1, l_2, l_3 (1 ≤ l_i ≤ 10^8) — the lengths of the sticks.

**2. Output format**

For each testcase, print "YES" if it's possible to break one of the sticks into two pieces with positive integer length in such a way that it's possible to construct a rectangle from the resulting four sticks. Otherwise, print "NO".

**3. Possible problems**

* The input format may not be correctly parsed.
* The output format may not be correctly generated.
* The logic of the program may be incorrect.
* The program may not be efficient enough.

**4. Bugs**

* The program may not handle all possible input cases.
* The program may not be robust to errors.
* The program may not be maintainable.
* The program may not be extensible.

**5. Solutions**

To avoid these problems, you should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand the input and output formats. You should also test your program on a variety of input cases to make sure that it handles all possible scenarios. Finally, you should make sure that your program is efficient and well-written.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1622_B. Berland Music

Pain points:

 **1. Input format**

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of songs.

The second line of each testcase contains n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) — the permutation of the predicted ratings.

The third line contains a single string s, consisting of n characters. Each character is either a 0 or a 1. 0 means that Monocarp disliked the song, and 1 means that he liked it.

The sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

**2. Output format**

For each testcase, print a permutation q — the re-evaluated ratings of the songs. If there are multiple answers such that ∑_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i| is minimum possible, you can print any of them.

**3. Constraints**

    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    
    print(*get_ans(n, p, s))
```

**Possible bugs and errors**

1. The input format is not correct. For example, if the first line of the input is `1`, then the program will crash.
2. The output format is not correct. For example, if the output is `1 2 3`, then the program will crash.
3. The constraints are not correct. For example, if the input is `n = 10^6`, then the program will crash.
4. The algorithm is not correct. For example, if the input is `n = 3`, `p = [1, 2, 3]`, and `s = '111'`, then the output should be `[1, 2, 3]`, but the program will output `[2, 1, 3]`.
5. The code is not efficient. For example, if the input is `n = 10^6`, then the program will run very slowly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1622_C. Set or Decrease

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data contains integers that can be very large. If you use incorrect data types to store the input data, you may get incorrect results. For example, if you use `int` to store the array `a`, you may get an overflow error when the sum of `a` is too large.

**2. Not considering the edge cases**

The problem statement specifies some edge cases, such as `n == 1` and `k == a_i`. You should make sure that your code handles these edge cases correctly.

**3. Using incorrect algorithms**

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. However, if you use a brute-force algorithm, your code will be very slow.

**4. Making mistakes in your implementation**

Even if you use the correct algorithms, you may still make mistakes in your implementation. For example, you may forget to update the variable `sum` when you decrease an element of `a`.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it to the judge. This will help you catch any bugs in your code.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1622_D. Shuffle

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect calculation of the number of substrings with exactly k 1s.**

The number of substrings with exactly k 1s can be calculated as follows:

```
num_substrings = (n - k + 1) * (n - k + 2) / 2
```

However, this formula is incorrect if k is greater than n / 2. In this case, the number of substrings with exactly k 1s is actually equal to the number of substrings with exactly n - k 0s.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the number of ways to shuffle a substring.**

The number of ways to shuffle a substring with k 1s is equal to k!. However, this formula is incorrect if k is equal to 0 or n. In these cases, the number of ways to shuffle the substring is actually equal to 1.

**3. Incorrect modulo operation.**

When calculating the answer, it is important to perform the modulo operation correctly. The modulo operation is performed by taking the remainder of the division of a number by another number. For example, 10 mod 3 is 1, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.

When calculating the answer to this problem, it is important to use the modulo operation with the number 998244353. This is because the answer can be very large, and the modulo operation ensures that the answer is always less than or equal to 998244353.

**4. Incorrect use of the factorial function.**

The factorial function is a mathematical function that is defined as the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to a given number. For example, 5! is equal to 120, because 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.

The factorial function can be used to calculate the number of ways to shuffle a substring. However, it is important to use the factorial function correctly. For example, if you are trying to calculate the number of ways to shuffle a substring with k 1s, you should use the factorial function k!.

**5. Incorrect use of the binomial coefficient.**

The binomial coefficient is a mathematical function that is defined as the number of ways to choose k objects from a set of n objects. For example, the binomial coefficient (5, 2) is equal to 10, because there are 10 ways to choose 2 objects from a set of 5 objects.

The binomial coefficient can be used to calculate the number of substrings with exactly k 1s. However, it is important to use the binomial coefficient correctly. For example, if you are trying to calculate the number of substrings with k 1s in a string of length n, you should use the binomial coefficient (n, k).
Test inputs:
```
# 1. Incorrect calculation of the number of substrings with exactly k 1s.

n, k = map(int, input().split())
s = input()

num_substrings = (n - k + 1) * (n - k + 2) / 2
print(num_substrings % 998244353)

# 2. Incorrect calculation of the number of ways to shuffle a substring.

n, k = map(int, input().split())
s = input()

num_ways = k!
print(num_ways % 998244353)

# 3. Incorrect modulo operation.

n, k = map(int, input().split())
s = input()

num_substrings = (n - k + 1) * (n - k + 2) / 2
num_ways = k!

print(num_substrings % 998244353)

# 4. Incorrect use of the factorial function.

n, k = map(int, input().split())
s = input()

num_substrings = (n - k + 1) * (n - k + 2) / 2
num_ways = 5!

print(num_substrings % 998244353)

# 5. Incorrect use of the binomial coefficient.

n, k = map(int, input().split())
s = input()

num_substrings = (n - k + 1) * (n - k + 2) / 2
num_ways = (n, k)

print(num_substrings % 998244353)

CODEFORCES 1622_F. Quadratic Set

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the factorial function.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. Make sure to use the correct formula for the factorial function, and be careful not to overflow your data types.
2. **Incorrect handling of negative numbers.** The factorial function is only defined for positive integers, so you need to handle negative numbers carefully. One way to do this is to check if the input number is negative, and if so, return 1.
3. **Incorrect handling of zero.** The factorial of zero is 1, so you need to make sure to handle this case correctly.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over a set of numbers, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one or more numbers. Be careful to check your code carefully for off-by-one errors.
5. **Incorrect use of variables.** Make sure to use variables correctly and initialize them with the correct values. This can be a common source of errors, especially when working with large data sets.
6. **Incorrect logic.** Make sure that your logic is correct and that you are not missing any cases. This can be a difficult task, especially when the problem is complex. It is often helpful to draw a diagram or write out the steps of your solution in English before you start coding.
7. **Runtime errors.** Make sure that your code runs correctly and does not have any runtime errors. This can be a difficult task, especially when working with large data sets. It is often helpful to use a debugger to help you find and fix runtime errors.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect implementation of the factorial function:** A developer might incorrectly implement the factorial function by using the following formula:

```
def factorial(n):
  if n < 0:
    return 1
  else:
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

This implementation is incorrect because it does not handle the case of zero correctly. The correct implementation of the factorial function is as follows:

```
def factorial(n):
  if n < 0:
    return 1
  elif n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

* **Incorrect handling of negative numbers:** A developer might incorrectly handle negative numbers by returning the following value:

```
def quadratic_set(n):
  if n < 0:
    return 1
  else:
    return n ** 2
```

This implementation is incorrect because it does not return the correct value for negative numbers. The correct implementation of the quadratic set function is as follows:

```
def quadratic_set(n):
  if n < 0:
    return 0
  else:
    return n ** 2
```

* **Incorrect handling of zero:** A developer might incorrectly handle zero by returning the following value:

```
def quadratic_set(n):
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    return n ** 2
```

This implementation is incorrect because it does not return the correct value for zero. The correct implementation of the quadratic set function is as follows:

```
def quadratic_set(n):
  if n == 0:
    return 0
  else:
    return n ** 2
```

* **Off-by-one errors:** A developer might make an off-by-one error when iterating over a set of numbers. For example, the following code would miss the number 5:

```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
  if i ** 2 == n:
    print(i)
```

The correct code would be as follows:

```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
  if i ** 2 <= n:
    print(i)
```

* **Incorrect use of variables:** A developer might incorrectly use variables in their code. For example, the following code would not work correctly because the variable `i` is not initialized:

```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
  if i ** 2 == n:
    print(i)
```

The correct code would be as follows:

```
i = 1
while i <= n:
  if i ** 2 == n:
    print(i)
  i += 1
```

* **Incorrect logic:** A developer might make an error in their logic when solving this problem. For example, the following code would not work correctly

CODEFORCES 1623_A. Robot Cleaner

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. This can cause the program to crash or output incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect variable initialization**. The variables used in the program must be initialized correctly. For example, if a variable is used to store the number of rows in the room, it must be initialized to the correct value before it is used. Otherwise, the program may output incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be correct. For example, the program must correctly determine the number of steps it takes for the robot to clean the dirty cell. Otherwise, the program may output incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect error handling**. The program must handle errors correctly. For example, if the input is invalid, the program must output an error message and terminate. Otherwise, the program may crash or output incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect output format**. The output of the program must be in the correct format. For example, the output must be a single integer that represents the number of steps it takes for the robot to clean the dirty cell. Otherwise, the program may output incorrect results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1623_B. Game on Ranges

Pain points:
Possible problems and bugs:

1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem is asking for the number Bob picked for each range Alice picked. A common mistake is to output the number Bob picked for the entire range. For example, in the input ```
1
1 1
```
the correct output is ```
1 1 1
```
but a common mistake is ```
1 1 1 1
```

2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm is simple: for each range, find the midpoint and output the midpoint. A common mistake is to output the left endpoint of the range. For example, in the input ```
1
1 1
```
the correct output is ```
1 1 1
```
but a common mistake is ```
1 1 1
```

3. **Off-by-one errors.** The algorithm involves a lot of integer arithmetic, so it is easy to make off-by-one errors. For example, in the input ```
3
1 3
2 3
2 2
```
the correct output is ```
1 3 1
2 3 3
2 2 2
```
but a common mistake is ```
1 3 2
2 3 3
2 2 1
```

4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem has a few edge cases, such as when the range is empty or when the range contains only one element. A common mistake is to not handle these edge cases correctly. For example, in the input ```
1
1
```
the correct output is ```
1 1 1
```
but a common mistake is ```
1 1 0

CODEFORCES 1623_C. Balanced Stone Heaps

Pain points:
**1. ** **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem states that "You can choose a number d (0 ≤ 3 ⋅ d ≤ h_i), move d stones from the i-th heap to the (i - 1)-th heap, and 2 ⋅ d stones from the i-th heap to the (i - 2)-th heap." This means that you can only move a maximum of 3 * d stones from the i-th heap. However, some developers may incorrectly assume that you can move any number of stones from the i-th heap, which would lead to an incorrect solution.

**2. ** **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for solving this problem is fairly straightforward. However, some developers may make mistakes in their implementation, such as forgetting to update the values of h_i, h_{i - 1}, and h_{i - 2} after moving stones. This would lead to an incorrect solution.

**3. ** **Insufficient testing.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly before submitting it to the judge. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed in your implementation. Some common mistakes that developers make when testing their solutions include:

    * Not testing all possible input cases.
    * Not testing your solution on large input data sets.
    * Not testing your solution on different programming languages.

**4. ** **Failure to debug your solution.** If your solution does not pass the judge, it is important to debug your solution to find the source of the error. Some common debugging techniques include:

    * Using a debugger to step through your code.
    * Printing out the values of your variables at different points in your code.
    * Using a unit testing framework to test your code.

CODEFORCES 1623_D. Robot Cleaner Revisit

Pain points:
### Possible problems and bugs

1. **Incorrect calculation of the expected time.** The expected time is the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes multiplied by the corresponding times. For example, if there are two possible outcomes with probabilities $p_1$ and $p_2$ and corresponding times $t_1$ and $t_2$, then the expected time is $p_1t_1 + p_2t_2$.
2. **Using the wrong probability.** The probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. For example, if there are 10 possible outcomes and 3 of them are favorable, then the probability of a favorable outcome is 3/10.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the expected time, it is important to make sure that you are not counting the same outcome twice. For example, if you are calculating the expected time to roll a die and get a 6, you cannot count the outcome of rolling a 6 on the first roll and then rolling a 6 on the second roll.
4. **Using the wrong modulo operation.** When calculating the expected time, it is important to use the correct modulo operation. For example, if you are calculating the expected time modulo 100, then you need to make sure that you are using the modulo operation % 100.
5. **Using the wrong data type.** When calculating the expected time, it is important to use the correct data type. For example, if you are calculating the expected time modulo 100, then you need to use an integer data type.

### How to avoid these problems and bugs

1. To avoid incorrect calculation of the expected time, make sure that you are correctly adding up the probabilities of all possible outcomes and multiplying them by the corresponding times. You can do this by using a spreadsheet or a calculator.
2. To avoid using the wrong probability, make sure that you are correctly calculating the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of outcomes. You can do this by drawing a diagram or by using a formula.
3. To avoid off-by-one errors, make sure that you are not counting the same outcome twice. You can do this by keeping track of the outcomes that you have already counted.
4. To avoid using the wrong modulo operation, make sure that you are using the correct operator for the modulus operation. You can do this by checking the documentation for your programming language.
5. To avoid using the wrong data type, make sure that you are using the correct data type for the expected time. You can do this by checking the documentation for your programming language.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1623_E. Middle Duplication

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect tree traversal**

The first step in solving this problem is to traverse the tree in in-order. This means that we visit the left subtree of a node, then the node itself, and then the right subtree. However, if we do this incorrectly, we may end up with a tree that is not in in-order, which will lead to incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect duplicate label assignment**

Once we have the tree in in-order, we need to assign duplicate labels to the nodes. The problem states that we can only duplicate the label of a node if it is the root of the tree or if its parent also has its label duplicated. However, if we do not check this condition, we may end up duplicating the label of a node that should not be duplicated, which will lead to incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect lexicographic comparison**

The problem states that we need to find the lexicographically smallest string representation of the tree. This means that we need to compare the strings in order to find the one that comes first in the dictionary. However, if we do not compare the strings correctly, we may end up with an incorrect answer.

**4. Incorrect output**

Finally, we need to output the lexicographically smallest string representation of the tree. However, if we do not output the string correctly, we will not get credit for the problem.

Here are some tips to avoid these problems:

* Make sure that you traverse the tree in in-order.
* Check the condition for duplicate label assignment before assigning a duplicate label to a node.
* Compare the strings correctly to find the lexicographically smallest one.
* Output the string correctly.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs that developers may encounter when solving this problem.
