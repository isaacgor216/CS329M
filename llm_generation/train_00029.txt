Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the input numbers.** The input numbers are given as integers, but they can be very large. If you use a data type that is not large enough, you will get an overflow error.
2. **Using the wrong data type for the output.** The output is the sum of a large number of integers, so it can also be very large. If you use a data type that is not large enough, you will get an overflow error.
3. **Not using the correct algorithm.** The problem can be solved using a simple algorithm, but there are more efficient algorithms that can be used for larger inputs.
4. **Making a mistake in your implementation.** This is the most common cause of bugs. Make sure you carefully check your code for errors before submitting it.
5. **Not handling edge cases correctly.** The problem statement specifies a few edge cases that you need to handle correctly. Make sure you don't miss any of these cases.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that you might encounter when solving this problem:

* Using `int` to store the input numbers when they are larger than `int` can represent.
* Using `int` to store the output when it is larger than `int` can represent.
* Using a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem when a more efficient algorithm is available.
* Making a mistake in your implementation of the algorithm.
* Not handling the edge cases correctly.

By avoiding these common problems, you can increase your chances of solving this problem correctly.

Title:
CODECHEF sprnmbrs

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of Euler's totient function.** The Euler's totient function $\phi(n)$ counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ that are coprime with $n$. A common mistake is to use the formula $\phi(n) = n - 1$ for all $n$. However, this formula is only correct for prime numbers. For composite numbers, the formula is more complicated.
2. **Incorrect use of modular arithmetic.** Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic where the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are performed modulo a fixed integer $m$. This means that when performing these operations, the results are always reduced modulo $m$. A common mistake is to forget to reduce the results modulo $m$, which can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** When working with large integers, it is important to be aware of the possibility of overflow. Overflow occurs when an integer is too large to be represented in the computer's memory. If overflow occurs, the results of the computation will be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.** Floating-point numbers are a type of data that represents real numbers using a limited number of bits. This can lead to rounding errors, which can cause incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect use of the bitwise operators.** The bitwise operators &, |, ^, and ~ are used to perform bitwise operations on integers. A common mistake is to use these operators incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect results.
6. **Incorrect use of the logical operators && and ||.** The logical operators && and || are used to perform logical operations on boolean values. A common mistake is to use these operators incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect results.
7. **Incorrect use of the conditional operator ? :.** The conditional operator ? : is used to evaluate a condition and return one of two values depending on the result of the condition. A common mistake is to use this operator incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect results.
8. **Incorrect use of the switch statement.** The switch statement is used to select one of several statements to execute based on the value of a variable. A common mistake is to use this statement incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect results.
9. **Incorrect use of the break statement.** The break statement is used to terminate a loop or switch statement early. A common mistake is to use this statement incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect results.
10. **Incorrect use of the continue statement.** The continue statement is used to skip the remainder of the current iteration of a loop. A common mistake is to use this statement incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect results.

CODEFORCES 1006_D. Two Strings Swaps

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem statement is quite long and detailed, so it is easy to miss some important details. For example, it is important to note that you cannot apply preprocess moves to the string b or make any preprocess moves after the first change is made.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution to this problem is not very difficult, but there are a few subtle details that can be easy to get wrong. For example, you need to make sure that you are only applying preprocess moves to the string a, and that you are not applying any preprocess moves after the first change is made.
3. **Incorrect testing of the solution.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. This can be done by generating a variety of test cases and checking that your solution produces the correct output for each case.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly counting the number of preprocess moves needed.** A common mistake is to count the number of preprocess moves needed as the number of characters in a that are not equal to the corresponding characters in b. However, this is not correct because you can also apply preprocess moves to the string a to make it equal to b. For example, if a = "abacaba" and b = "bacabaa", then you can apply the preprocess moves a_1 := 'b', a_3 := 'c', a_4 := 'a', and a_5 := 'b' to make a equal to b. This requires 4 preprocess moves, even though there are only 3 characters in a that are not equal to the corresponding characters in b.
* **Applying preprocess moves to the string b.** Another common mistake is to apply preprocess moves to the string b. This is not allowed, and will result in an incorrect answer.
* **Applying preprocess moves after the first change is made.** You cannot apply preprocess moves after the first change is made. This is because the first change will make the strings a and b equal, and you will no longer need to apply any preprocess moves.

By avoiding these common problems and bugs, you can increase the chances of solving this problem correctly.

CODEFORCES 102_C. Homework

Pain points:
1. The input string may contain duplicate characters. For example, the input string "aaaaa" contains 5 duplicate characters "a".
2. The number of characters that can be deleted may be greater than the length of the input string. For example, the input string "abcdefgh" has length 8, and the number of characters that can be deleted is 10.
3. The output string must have exactly m distinct characters. For example, the output string "aaaaa" has only one distinct character "a".
4. The output string must be a subsequence of the input string. For example, the output string "aaaa" is a subsequence of the input string "aaaaa".
5. The output string must be unique. For example, the output strings "aaaa" and "aaab" are not unique.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1051_C. Vasya and Multisets

Pain points:
1. The input format is not correct. For example, the input ```
3
1 2 3
``` is not correct because there is no newline character between the first and second lines.
2. The input data is not valid. For example, the input ```
3
1 2 3
``` is not valid because the number 3 appears twice in the input.
3. The output format is not correct. For example, the output ```
YES
BABA
``` is not correct because the second line contains 5 characters, but the input contains only 3 numbers.
4. The output data is not valid. For example, the output ```
NO
ABC
``` is not valid because the second line contains the character 'C', but the input contains only numbers.
5. The solution is incorrect. For example, the following solution is incorrect for the input ```
3
1 2 3
```:
```
def main():
    n = int(input())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = []
    b = []
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] not in a and s[i] not in b:
            a.append(s[i])
        elif s[i] in a:
            b.append(s[i])
    print('YES')
    print(''.join(['A' if x in a else 'B' for x in s]))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
The solution is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the number of nice numbers in multiset a is the same as the number of nice numbers in multiset b.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1073_D. Berland Fair

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format of the problem is `n, T` followed by `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. Make sure to read the input correctly and handle any errors appropriately.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer representing the total number of candies Polycarp will buy. Make sure to format your output correctly.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over the booths, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one booth or count one booth twice. Be careful to check your logic carefully and make sure that you are counting the number of candies correctly.
4. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem requires you to use a data structure to store the prices of the candies at each booth. Make sure that you choose the right data structure for the job and that you use it correctly.
5. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm you use to solve the problem may be incorrect. Make sure to carefully read the problem statement and come up with an algorithm that is guaranteed to give the correct answer.
6. **Runtime errors.** Your code may run into runtime errors such as stack overflows or segmentation faults. Make sure to check your code for any errors that could cause it to crash.
7. **Memory errors.** Your code may run out of memory if it is not careful about how it allocates and frees memory. Make sure to use your memory efficiently and free any memory that you no longer need.
8. **Incorrect test cases.** When testing your code, make sure to include a variety of test cases that cover all of the possible scenarios. This will help you to catch any bugs that your code may have.
9. **Incorrect debugging.** When debugging your code, it is important to be able to identify the source of the bug. Make sure to use the right tools and techniques to help you track down the bug.
10. **Giving up too easily.** When you encounter a difficult problem, it is easy to get discouraged and give up. However, it is important to remember that every problem can be solved if you are willing to put in the time and effort.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1095_D. Circular Dance

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the input/output.**

The input of this problem is a list of integers, so you should use a list to store the input data. The output should also be a list of integers, so you should use a list to store the output data.

**2. Not handling the edge cases correctly.**

The problem states that the number of kids is at least 3. So you should make sure to handle the case where the number of kids is 3.

**3. Making a mistake in the logic of the algorithm.**

The algorithm for solving this problem is not very complicated, but it is still possible to make a mistake. Make sure to carefully check your logic before submitting your code.

**4. Using inefficient algorithms.**

The algorithm for solving this problem can be implemented in O(n) time. However, there are more efficient algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. For example, you could use a hash table to store the information about which kids remembered which other kids. This would allow you to find the order of the kids in the circle in O(n) time.

**5. Not using the right data structures.**

The problem states that the order of the kids in the circle is a permutation. This means that you can use a data structure like a linked list or a hash table to store the order of the kids. Using the right data structure can make your code more efficient.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1114_E. Arithmetic Progression

Pain points:
### Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement is quite long and detailed, so it is important to read it carefully and make sure that you understand all of the requirements. A common mistake is to assume that the list of numbers is already sorted in increasing order, when in fact it is not.
2. **Not using the provided hints.** The problem statement provides a number of helpful hints, such as the fact that the list of numbers forms an arithmetic progression with a positive common difference. These hints can be very helpful in solving the problem, so it is important to read them carefully and make sure that you understand them.
3. **Making incorrect queries.** The queries that you make to the device are limited in number, so it is important to make them carefully. A common mistake is to make queries that are not relevant to the problem, such as querying for the value of a number that is not in the list.
4. **Not handling errors correctly.** The device may return an error code if you make too many queries or if you violate the number range in your queries. It is important to handle these errors correctly, such as by terminating your program or by printing an appropriate error message.
5. **Not using efficient algorithms.** The problem can be solved efficiently using a binary search algorithm. A common mistake is to use a brute-force algorithm, which will take much longer to run.

## Code:

```
#!/bin/python3

import sys

def query(x):
    print("> " + str(x), end="\n")
    sys.stdout.flush()
    return int(input())

def main():
    n = int(input())

    # Find the smallest element in the list.
    smallest = 10**9
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = query(i)
        if x < smallest:
            smallest = x

    # Find the common difference between the elements in the list.
    d = 0
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        x = query(i)
        d = x - smallest
        if d != query(i - 1) - smallest:
            print("! " + str(smallest) + " " + str(d))
            sys.exit(0)

Title:
CODEFORCES 1143_A. The Doors

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a sequence of integers. If we use the wrong data type to store the input data, it may cause problems when we try to access the elements of the sequence. For example, if we use a `char` array to store the input data, we will not be able to access the elements of the array using the subscript operator. This is because the subscript operator is only defined for arrays of integral types.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The correct algorithm for solving this problem is to use a greedy algorithm. A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that makes the best possible decision at each step, without considering the future consequences of that decision. In this case, the best decision at each step is to open the door that belongs to the exit that has the fewest open doors.

**3. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

The boundary conditions for this problem are that there must be at least one door in each exit and that all doors must be opened eventually. If we do not check for these boundary conditions, our algorithm may not work correctly.

**4. Not handling errors correctly**

There are a number of errors that can occur when reading the input data or when opening the doors. We need to make sure that we handle these errors correctly so that our program does not crash.

**5. Not using efficient data structures**

The input data is a sequence of integers. We can use a `vector` to store the input data. A `vector` is a dynamic array that can grow and shrink as needed. This is an efficient data structure for storing the input data because it does not require us to preallocate any memory.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1163_B1. Cat Party (Easy Edition)

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The most common mistake when solving this problem is to implement the algorithm incorrectly. This can lead to incorrect results or even a runtime error.

**2. Using incorrect data types**

Another common mistake is to use incorrect data types. For example, if you are using an integer to represent the number of days, you may overflow the integer if the number of days is too large.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

It is important to handle edge cases when solving any problem. For example, if the number of days is 0, then the answer is 0.

**4. Using inefficient algorithms**

There are many different ways to solve this problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. It is important to choose an efficient algorithm to solve the problem within the time limit.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it to the judge. This will help you to catch any errors in your code and ensure that it is correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1183_G. Candy Box (hard version)

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm.** The greedy algorithm used to solve this problem is to sort the candies by their types and then add the candies to the gift one by one, starting with the candy with the smallest type. However, if the candies are not sorted correctly, then the algorithm may not find the optimal solution.
* **Incorrect handling of duplicate candies.** The problem states that the numbers of candies of each type presented in a gift should be all distinct. However, if the candies are not handled correctly, then the algorithm may end up with a gift that contains duplicate candies.
* **Incorrect handling of candies that the user wants to keep for themselves.** The problem states that the user wants to maximize the number of candies having f_i = 1 in the gift. However, if the candies that the user wants to keep for themselves are not handled correctly, then the algorithm may not find the optimal solution.
* **Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of candies in a gift.** The problem states that the maximum number of candies in a gift is the minimum of the number of candies of each type. However, if the calculation is not done correctly, then the algorithm may return an incorrect answer.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully implement the greedy algorithm and to correctly handle duplicate candies, candies that the user wants to keep for themselves, and the maximum number of candies in a gift.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1201_B. Zero Array

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input handling.** The input format specifies that the first line contains a single integer n, and the second line contains n integers. A developer may accidentally read the first line as a list of integers, or the second line as a single integer. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm for solving this problem is to repeatedly find two elements that sum to 0 and decrease them both by 1. A developer may accidentally use an incorrect algorithm, such as trying to find two elements that are equal to 0, or trying to decrease all of the elements by 1. This would cause the program to fail to find a solution, or to produce incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** A developer may accidentally miscount the number of elements in the array, or the number of operations performed. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
4. **Memory errors.** A developer may accidentally allocate too much or too little memory for the array, or for other data structures used in the program. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
5. **Synchronization errors.** If the program is multi-threaded, a developer may accidentally access shared data without the proper synchronization. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
6. **Security vulnerabilities.** A developer may accidentally introduce a security vulnerability, such as a buffer overflow or a SQL injection vulnerability. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the program or to the data it stores.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully review their code and test it thoroughly before deploying it to production. They should also use a development environment that provides features such as static analysis and unit testing to help identify potential problems.

2. **Not handling cycles in the graph correctly.** If there are cycles in the graph, it may be impossible to start all of the bubble cores.
3. **Not finding the optimal order to start the bubble cores.** The optimal order to start the bubble cores is the one that maximizes the sum of their potentials.
4. **Not using the correct data structures.** The graph should be represented using an appropriate data structure, such as an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix.
5. **Making incorrect or incomplete calculations.** The calculations for the potential of each bubble core and the total sum of potentials should be done carefully to avoid errors.
6. **Not handling edge cases correctly.** The input may contain invalid or unexpected values, such as negative numbers or nodes that are not connected to any other nodes. The code should handle these edge cases gracefully.

CODEFORCES 1261_F. Xor-Set

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the bitwise XOR operation.** This is the most common mistake that programmers make when solving this problem. The bitwise XOR operation is not commutative, so it is important to make sure that you are using the correct order of operands. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
x = a ^ b
```

The correct code would be:

```
x = b ^ a
```

2. **Incorrect handling of overlapping segments.** When two segments overlap, it is important to only count the elements in the intersection of the two segments once. For example, if the sets A and B are defined as follows:

```
A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {2, 3, 4}
```

Then the set C = {1, 2, 3, 4}. However, if we simply add the elements of A and B together, we would get {1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4}, which is incorrect. To correctly handle overlapping segments, we need to use a technique called **union-find**.

3. **Incorrect modular arithmetic.** When computing the sum of the elements in set C, it is important to use modular arithmetic. This is because the sum of the elements in set C may overflow the integer data type. For example, if the set C is defined as follows:

```
C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

Then the sum of the elements in set C is 15, which is greater than the maximum value of an integer. To correctly compute the sum of the elements in set C, we need to use the following formula:

```
sum(C) = (sum(C) mod 998244353) + (sum(C) // 998244353) * 998244353
```

4. **Incorrect input format.** The input for this problem is given in a specific format. It is important to make sure that you are correctly parsing the input data. For example, if the input is given as a list of lists, you need to make sure that you are correctly converting the lists into tuples.

5. **Incorrect output format.** The output for this problem must be a single integer. It is important to make sure that you are correctly formatting the output data. For example, you should not output the output as a string.

4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correct. For example, the output may contain a space between two integers, or it may contain a non-integer value.
5. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may make a mistake in the indexing of an array or list. For example, the developer may access an element of an array that is one index out of bounds.
6. **Infinite loop**. The developer may create an infinite loop in their code. For example, the developer may have a while loop that never terminates.
7. **Stack overflow**. The developer may cause a stack overflow in their code. For example, the developer may have a recursive function that calls itself too many times.
8. **Memory leak**. The developer may create a memory leak in their code. For example, the developer may allocate memory that is never freed.
9. **Race condition**. The developer may create a race condition in their code. For example, the developer may have two threads that access the same data without synchronization.

CODEFORCES 1327_F. AND Segments

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the bitwise AND operation**.

The bitwise AND operation is a binary operator that takes two operands and returns a third operand, which is the bit-wise AND of the two operands. In other words, the third operand is a binary number that is formed by taking the bits of the first operand and ANDing them with the bits of the second operand.

For example, if the first operand is `1010` and the second operand is `1100`, then the third operand will be `1000`. This is because the bits in the first operand that are `1` will be ANDed with the bits in the second operand that are also `1`, and the bits in the first operand that are `0` will be ANDed with the bits in the second operand that are also `0`.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the modulo operation**.

The modulo operation is a mathematical operation that takes two operands and returns a third operand, which is the remainder of the first operand divided by the second operand. In other words, the third operand is the number that remains after the first operand is divided by the second operand.

For example, if the first operand is `10` and the second operand is `3`, then the third operand will be `1`. This is because `10 / 3 = 3.333`, and the remainder of `3.333` divided by `3` is `1`.

**3. Incorrect implementation of the factorial function**.

The factorial function is a mathematical function that takes a positive integer as its input and returns the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to the input. In other words, the factorial of a number `n` is the product of the numbers `1`, `2`, `3`, ..., `n`.

For example, the factorial of `5` is `120`. This is because `5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120`.

**4. Incorrect implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes**.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple algorithm that can be used to find all of the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer. The algorithm works by first creating a list of all of the positive integers less than or equal to the given integer. It then iterates through the list, starting with the first integer. If the integer is prime, then it is added to a list of prime numbers. If the integer is not prime, then it is divided by all of the prime numbers that are less than or equal to its square root. The process is repeated until all of the integers in the list have been processed.

**5. Incorrect implementation of the Catalan numbers**.

The Catalan numbers are a sequence of integers that occur in many counting problems in combinatorics. The Catalan numbers can be defined recursively as follows:

```
C_0 = 1
C_n = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} C_i \cdot C_{n-i-1}
```

where `n` is a positive integer.

**6. Incorrect implementation of the Lucas numbers**.

The Lucas numbers are a sequence of integers that are closely related to the Fibonacci numbers. The Lucas numbers can be defined recursively as follows:

```
L_0 = 2
L_1 = 1
L_n = L_{n-1} + L_{n-2}
```

where `n` is a positive integer.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1346_H. Game with Segments

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correct. For example, the input `1 1` is not correct because it does not specify the number of terminal segments. The developer should check the input format and raise an error if it is incorrect.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not always correct. For example, the output `1 2 3` is not correct because it does not have the same number of elements as the number of initial segments. The developer should check the output format and raise an error if it is incorrect.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The developer may implement the logic incorrectly. For example, the developer may not consider all possible cases. The developer should carefully test the code to ensure that it is correct.

**4. Memory leaks**

The developer may not free up memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to memory leaks, which can eventually cause the program to crash. The developer should use a memory management tool to track memory usage and identify any memory leaks.

**5. Race conditions**

The developer may not handle race conditions correctly. For example, the developer may access a shared resource without locking it, which can lead to data corruption. The developer should use locks to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.

**6. Deadlocks**

The developer may create deadlocks. For example, the developer may create a situation where two threads are each waiting for the other thread to release a lock, which can cause the program to hang indefinitely. The developer should use a deadlock avoidance or deadlock prevention algorithm to prevent deadlocks.

**7. Security vulnerabilities**

The developer may introduce security vulnerabilities. For example, the developer may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server. The developer should carefully review the code to identify any potential security vulnerabilities and fix them.

**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correctly specified. For example, the input may contain an incorrect number of elements, or the elements may not be of the correct type. This can lead to errors in the program's logic and incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the number of garlands**

The number of garlands can be calculated in different ways. The most common way is to use the following formula:

```
N = (m^n) / (m!)^n
```

However, this formula is only valid if the number of layers is less than the number of colors. If the number of layers is greater than the number of colors, the formula will give an incorrect result.

**3. Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic**

Functions are used to group together related code. It is important to use functions correctly, otherwise the program may not work as expected. For example, it is important to call functions with the correct arguments, and to return the correct value from a function.

**7. Incorrect use of loops**

Loops are used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times. It is important to use loops correctly, otherwise the program may not work as expected. For example, it is important to initialize the loop variable before the loop starts, and to check the loop condition after each iteration.

**8. Incorrect use of conditional statements**

Conditional statements are used to execute different code depending on the value of a condition. It is important to use conditional statements correctly, otherwise the program may not work as expected. For example, it is important to use the correct operator in the condition, and to use the correct statements in each branch of the conditional statement.

**9. Incorrect use of data structures**

Title:
CODEFORCES 1505_F. Math

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type.** The input is an integer, so the developer should use `int` or `long` to store it. Using a smaller data type, such as `short` or `byte`, could lead to incorrect results.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** The problem asks for the absolute value of `a`, which means the distance from `a` to 0. It is easy to make a mistake and calculate the distance from `a` to 1 instead.
3. **Using the wrong formula.** The absolute value of a number is its value without the sign. The formula for the absolute value of a number `x` is `|x| = x if x ≥ 0, |x| = -x if x < 0`.
4. **Not handling negative numbers correctly.** The problem does not specify whether `a` can be negative, so the developer should be careful to handle negative numbers correctly.
5. **Using floating-point numbers.** The problem asks for the absolute value of an integer, so the developer should use integers to calculate the absolute value. Using floating-point numbers could lead to rounding errors.
6. **Not using the modulus operator.** The modulus operator (`%`) can be used to find the remainder of a division. This can be useful for checking if a number is divisible by another number.
7. **Using the wrong comparison operator.** The problem asks for the absolute value of `a`, which means the distance from `a` to 0. The developer should use the `>` or `<` operator to compare `a` to 0, not the `==` operator.
8. **Not using the correct data type for the output.** The problem asks for the absolute value of `a`, which is an integer. The developer should use an integer to store the output. Using a floating-point number could lead to rounding errors.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1528_F. AmShZ Farm

Pain points:
 1. **Incorrect modular arithmetic**. One common mistake is to forget to perform modular arithmetic when computing intermediate results. For example, if you are computing `(a + b) % m`, you must first compute `a + b` and then take the remainder when dividing by `m`.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. Another common mistake is to forget to add or subtract 1 when computing an index. For example, if you are iterating over an array of size `n`, you must start at index `0` and end at index `n - 1`.
3. **Incorrect array bounds**. When accessing elements of an array, you must make sure that the index is within the bounds of the array. For example, if you are trying to access the element at index `n`, you will get an error if `n` is greater than the length of the array.
4. **Incorrect data types**. Make sure that you are using the correct data types for your variables. For example, if you are counting the number of elements in an array, you should use an integer data type, not a floating-point data type.
5. **Incorrect variable initialization**. Make sure that you initialize your variables to the correct values. For example, if you are using a variable to store the sum of a series of numbers, you should initialize the variable to 0.
6. **Uninitialized variables**. Another common mistake is to forget to initialize a variable. This can lead to undefined behavior, which can be difficult to debug.
7. **Unused variables**. If you declare a variable but never use it, you are wasting memory. It is good practice to remove unused variables from your code.
8. **Inefficient algorithms**. There are many different ways to solve a problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. It is important to choose an algorithm that is appropriate for the problem you are trying to solve.
9. **Incorrect use of library functions**. Make sure that you are using library functions correctly. For example, if you are using the `sort` function, you must make sure that the array is sorted in ascending order.
10. **Off-by-two errors**. Off-by-two errors are a special type of off-by-one error. They occur when you forget to add or subtract 2 when computing an index. For example, if you are iterating over an array of size `n`, you must start at index `1` and end at index `n - 2`.

Title:
CODEFORCES 15_E. Triangles

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format should be a single even integer `n`. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer, the number of Peter's routes modulo 1000000009. If the output format is incorrect, the program will get a Wrong Answer verdict.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of Peter's routes.** The number of Peter's routes can be calculated using the following formula:

```
`F(n) = F(n - 2) * 2 + F(n - 4) * 4 + F(n - 6) * 8 + ... + F(2) * 2^n`
```

where `F(0) = 1` and `F(k) = 0` for `k < 0`.

To calculate the number of Peter's routes modulo 1000000009, we can use the following algorithm:

1. Initialize a table `dp[i]` to store the number of Peter's routes for each `i` from 0 to `n`.
2. For `i` from 0 to `n`, calculate `dp[i]` using the following formula:

```
`dp[i] = (dp[i - 2] * 2 + dp[i - 4] * 4 + dp[i - 6] * 8 + ...) % 1000000009`
```

3. The answer is `dp[n]`.

4. **Failure to handle overflow.** The number of Peter's routes can be very large, so we need to take care of overflow. To do this, we can use the following algorithm:

1. Initialize a table `dp[i]` to store the number of Peter's routes for each `i` from 0 to `n`.
2. For `i` from 0 to `n`, calculate `dp[i]` using the following formula:

```
`dp[i] = (dp[i - 2] * 2 + dp[i - 4] * 4 + dp[i - 6] * 8 + ...) % 1000000009`
```

3. If `dp[n]` overflows, then divide it by 1000000009 and take the remainder.

5. **Using incorrect data types.** The number of Peter's routes can be very large, so we need to use a data type that can store large integers. We can use the `long long` data type in C++ or the `int64` data type in Python.

6. **Using incorrect algorithms.** The algorithm for calculating the number of Peter's routes is not very efficient. We can improve the efficiency of the algorithm by using the following techniques:

    * Using memoization to avoid recalculating the same values multiple times.
    * Using dynamic programming to reduce the number of calculations.
    * Using bit manipulation to reduce the number of operations.

Title:
CODEFORCES 17_B. Hierarchy

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always strictly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of employees is not a positive integer, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The data type of the input values must be correct. For example, if the qualifications of the employees are given as strings, the program will not be able to process them correctly.

**3. Undefined behavior**

The program may behave in an unexpected way if it is not properly defined. For example, if the program tries to access an element of an array that does not exist, it will crash.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that occurs when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to incorrect results or even crashes.

**5. Logical errors**

Logical errors are errors in the logic of the program. For example, if the program tries to find the minimum cost of a hierarchy when there is no such hierarchy, it will return an incorrect result.

**6. Runtime errors**

Runtime errors are errors that occur during the execution of the program. For example, if the program runs out of memory, it will crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 227_B. Effective Approach

Pain points:
**Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs that a Developer May Encounter When Solving This Problem:**

* **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving any problem. It is important to read the problem statement carefully and make sure that you understand all of the requirements. In this problem, the key requirement is that the two approaches are equivalent. This means that the number of comparisons that Vasya's approach makes should be the same as the number of comparisons that Petya's approach makes.
* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** Once you have understood the problem statement, you need to implement the algorithm correctly. In this problem, the algorithm is very simple. Vasya's approach simply iterates through the array from the beginning to the end, comparing each element with the search value. Petya's approach does the same thing, but it iterates through the array from the end to the beginning.
* **Incorrect testing of the algorithm.** It is important to test your algorithm thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. In this problem, you can test your algorithm by generating a random array and a random set of queries. You can then compare the number of comparisons that Vasya's approach makes with the number of comparisons that Petya's approach makes. If the two numbers are the same, then your algorithm is correct.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that developers may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Using the wrong data type for the array.** The array in this problem is a permutation of integers from 1 to n. This means that the elements of the array can be any integer from 1 to n. If you use the wrong data type for the array, then your algorithm may not work correctly.
* **Using the wrong comparison operator.** The comparison operator that you use to compare the elements of the array with the search value is important. If you use the wrong comparison operator, then your algorithm may not work correctly.
* **Using the wrong loop.** The two approaches in this problem both use loops to iterate through the array. If you use the wrong loop, then your algorithm may not work correctly.

By avoiding these common problems and bugs, you can increase your chances of solving this problem correctly.

CODEFORCES 346_D. Robot Control

Pain points:
### Possible Problems

* The input may not be valid. For example, the number of vertices or edges may be negative or greater than `10^6`.
* The input may not be formatted correctly. For example, the edges may not be separated by spaces.
* The input may not contain all of the necessary information. For example, it may not include the start and end vertices of the path.
* The output may not be correct. For example, it may not be the minimum number of orders required to reach the goal.
* The program may not be efficient. For example, it may take a long time to run or use a lot of memory.

### Possible Bugs

* The program may not handle all of the possible cases. For example, it may not work if the graph is not connected or if there is no path from the start vertex to the end vertex.
* The program may not be able to handle large inputs. For example, it may run out of memory or time if the number of vertices or edges is too large.
* The program may not be able to find the minimum number of orders efficiently. For example, it may use a brute-force approach that takes a long time to run.

### How to Avoid These Problems

To avoid these problems, you should carefully check the input for errors and make sure that it is formatted correctly. You should also make sure that the output is correct and that the program is efficient. Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use a programming language that is well-suited for the task. For example, if you are working with graphs, you may want to use a language that has built-in graph processing libraries.
* Use a data structure that is appropriate for the problem. For example, if you are working with a large graph, you may want to use a sparse graph data structure.
* Use an algorithm that is efficient for the problem. For example, if you are trying to find the shortest path in a graph, you may want to use Dijkstra's algorithm.
* Test your program thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly.

### Conclusion

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs that developers encounter when solving this problem.

max_volume = 0
for i in range(n):
    max_volume += cakes[i][0] * cakes[i][1]

print(max_volume)
```

This input data is incorrect because it contains a negative value.

7. **Bugs**

```
n = int(input())
cakes = []
for i in range(n):
    r, h = map(int, input().split())
    cakes.append((r, h))

CODEFORCES 701_D. As Fast As Possible

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is given as a string of five integers, but the problem statement specifies that the input data should be five positive integers. This could lead to a ValueError being thrown if the input data is not in the correct format.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum time**. The minimum time required for all n pupils to reach the place of excursion is given by the formula ```t = (l / v1) + (n / k) * (l / v2)```. However, if the value of ```n / k``` is not an integer, then the calculation of ```(n / k) * (l / v2)``` will produce a floating-point number. This could lead to a rounding error if the value of ```t``` is required to be accurate to within 10-6.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a real number, but the problem statement specifies that the output should be accurate to within 10-6. This could lead to a rounding error if the value of ```t``` is not accurate to within 10-6.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input data to ensure that it is in the correct format. The developer should also use the correct calculation for the minimum time and ensure that the output is formatted correctly.

CODEFORCES 745_D. Hongcow's Game

Pain points:
1. **Not flushing the output**. This is the most common mistake that programmers make when solving interactive problems. Make sure to flush your output after each print statement, otherwise you may get an Idleness Limit Exceeded verdict.
2. **Asking more than 20 questions**. Hongcow will only answer your questions for 20 rounds. If you ask more than 20 questions, you will get a Wrong Answer verdict.
3. **Using duplicate indices in your questions**. Hongcow will not answer your question if it contains duplicate indices.
4. **Using an invalid value of k in your questions**. k must be an integer between 1 and n, inclusive.
5. **Not printing the final answer**. Make sure to print the final answer as follows:
```
-1
<answer>
```
6. **Forgetting to flush the final answer**. Make sure to flush your output after printing the final answer.

Here are some tips for solving this problem:

1. Start by asking Hongcow a question with k = 1. This will give you the minimum value in the first row of the matrix.
2. Use the information you learned from the first question to ask Hongcow another question. This time, ask for the minimum value in the second row, excluding the first element.
3. Continue asking questions until you have found the minimum value in each row of the matrix.
4. Print the final answer as follows:
```
-1
<answer>
```
5. Make sure to flush your output after printing the final answer.

Title:
CODEFORCES 768_F. Barrels and boxes

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is `f, w, h` where `f` is the number of food boxes, `w` is the number of wine barrels, and `h` is the maximum height of a stack of wine barrels. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the probability.** The probability that Jon Snow will like the arrangement is equal to the number of arrangements that he likes divided by the total number of possible arrangements. The total number of possible arrangements is `(f + w)! / (f! * w!)`. The number of arrangements that Jon Snow likes is equal to the number of ways to arrange the food boxes and wine barrels such that no two stacks of food boxes are together and no two stacks of wine barrels are together. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of arrangements that Jon Snow does not like from the total number of possible arrangements.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the number of arrangements that Jon Snow does not like, it is important to be careful to avoid off-by-one errors. For example, if `f = 2` and `w = 1`, the number of arrangements that Jon Snow does not like is `2 * (w + 1) * (f - 1)!`. However, if we forget to subtract 1 from `f - 1`, we will get the incorrect answer of `2 * (w + 1) * f!`.
4. **Incorrect modular arithmetic.** When calculating the probability that Jon Snow will like the arrangement, it is important to use the correct modular arithmetic. The probability is a fraction, so it must be converted to a number modulo `10^9 + 7`. This can be done by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `10^9 + 7` and then reducing the fraction to its lowest terms.
5. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.** When calculating the probability that Jon Snow will like the arrangement, it is important to use integers instead of floating-point numbers. This is because floating-point numbers can be inaccurate, which can lead to incorrect results.

By avoiding these common problems, you can increase the chances of your program correctly solving the problem.

CODEFORCES 792_E. Colored Balls

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer `n` and the second line should contain `n` integer numbers. However, the input may not be in the correct format. For example, the input may contain a string instead of an integer, or it may contain more than one integer on the first line. If the input is not in the correct format, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the program should print a single integer. However, the program may print multiple integers, or it may print a string instead of an integer. If the output is not in the correct format, the program will receive a negative score.
3. **Incorrect algorithm.** The program may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the program may not find the minimum possible number of sets, or it may find a solution that does not satisfy all of the constraints. If the program does not find the correct solution, it will receive a negative score.
4. **Runtime error.** The program may run out of memory or time. If the program runs out of memory, it will crash. If the program runs out of time, it will receive a negative score.
5. **Incorrect data type.** The program may use the wrong data type to store the input or output. For example, the program may use an integer to store a floating-point number. If the program uses the wrong data type, it may produce incorrect results.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. The program should be carefully tested on a variety of inputs to ensure that it produces the correct output. The program should also be optimized to run efficiently and to avoid runtime errors.

Title:
CODEFORCES 813_B. The Golden Age

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when reading the input data. For example, if the input data is "2 3 1 10", the program will read the first two numbers correctly, but then it will try to read the third number as a year, which is not possible. This will cause the program to crash.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the golden age**

The golden age is the longest interval of years that does not contain any unlucky years. To find the golden age, we need to find all the unlucky years in the given interval and then subtract them from the length of the interval. However, it is possible to make a mistake when calculating the length of the interval or when finding the unlucky years. For example, if the input data is "2 3 1 10", the program will correctly find the unlucky years 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 10. However, it will incorrectly calculate the length of the interval as 10 - 7 = 3, when the correct answer is 10 - 6 = 4.

**3. Incorrect output**

The output format is not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when printing the output. For example, if the golden age is 4 years long, the program should print "4". However, if the program prints "4 years", it will be incorrect.

**4. Other bugs**

There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the program may crash due to a memory leak, or it may not be able to handle large input data. It is important to test the program thoroughly to catch any potential bugs.

CODEFORCES 92_D. Queue

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is `n ai` where `n` is the number of walruses and `ai` is the age of the `i`th walrus. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce an incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a list of `n` integers, where the `i`th integer is the displeasure of the `i`th walrus. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly output the results and will produce an incorrect answer.

**3. Overflow**

The ages of the walruses can be very large, so it is important to be careful to avoid overflow when performing calculations. For example, if you are adding two integers, you should make sure that the result does not exceed the maximum value of an integer.

**4. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm you use to solve this problem must be correct in order to produce the correct output. For example, if you are using a bubble sort algorithm to sort the ages of the walruses, you will not get the correct answer because bubble sort is not a stable sorting algorithm.

**5. Runtime errors**

The program you write to solve this problem must be able to run within the time limit specified by the problem. If your program takes too long to run, it will be marked as incorrect.

CODEFORCES 958_B2. Maximum Control (medium)

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly, and that you are not accidentally skipping or adding any lines.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single line of N space-separated integers. Make sure that you are printing the output in the correct format, and that you are not accidentally adding any extra spaces or newlines.

**3. Incorrect graph traversal**

The key to solving this problem is to correctly traverse the graph of planets and tunnels. It is important to make sure that you are visiting all of the planets, and that you are not visiting any planet more than once.

**4. Incorrect calculation of maximum controlled planets**

Once you have correctly traversed the graph, you need to calculate the maximum number of planets that can be controlled by the Resistance. This can be done by keeping track of the number of planets that are reachable from each planet. The maximum number of planets that can be controlled is the maximum of the number of planets that are reachable from each planet.

**5. Incorrect runtime**

The time complexity of this problem is O(N^2). This is because you need to visit each planet at least once, and you need to traverse the graph of tunnels between each pair of planets. If you are not careful, your solution could have a runtime of O(N^3), which would not be enough to pass the time limit.

Title:
HACKEREARTH a-simple-task

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may incorrectly assume that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the array is the answer. However, this is not always the case. For example, if the array contains the elements 2, 3, and 5, the GCD is 1, but the answer is 2 because 2 is the smallest integer that divides all of the elements in the array.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the GCD of the elements in the array. For example, if the array contains the elements 2, 3, and 5, the developer may incorrectly calculate the GCD as 4 because they forget to subtract 1 from each element before calculating the GCD.
3. **Incorrect use of data structures**. The developer may incorrectly use a data structure to store the elements in the array. For example, the developer may use a linked list to store the elements in the array, but this will not work correctly because the linked list does not support random access.
4. **Incorrect use of algorithms**. The developer may incorrectly use an algorithm to find the GCD of the elements in the array. For example, the developer may use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD, but this algorithm will not work correctly if any of the elements in the array are negative.
5. **Incorrect input handling**. The developer may incorrectly handle the input to the program. For example, the developer may not check if the input is valid before processing it.
6. **Incorrect output handling**. The developer may incorrectly handle the output from the program. For example, the developer may not format the output correctly or they may not print all of the output.

HACKEREARTH blackbox-1-3

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong formula for checking if a triplet is a primitive Pythagorean triple.**

The formula for checking if a triplet is a primitive Pythagorean triple is ```a^2 + b^2 = c^2```. However, some developers may mistakenly use the formula ```a^2 + b^2 = c^3```, which will not give the correct answer.

**2. Not checking if the numbers in the triplet are coprime.**

A primitive Pythagorean triple is one in which a, b, and c are coprime. This means that they have no common factors other than 1. Some developers may not check if the numbers in the triplet are coprime, which will result in an incorrect answer.

**3. Using a brute force approach to solve the problem.**

The brute force approach to solving this problem is to check every possible combination of a, b, and c to see if they form a primitive Pythagorean triple. This is very inefficient, and can take a long time to run for large values of a, b, and c.

**4. Using a divide and conquer approach to solve the problem.**

The divide and conquer approach to solving this problem is to recursively divide the problem into smaller and smaller subproblems until each subproblem can be solved easily. This is a more efficient approach than the brute force approach, but it can still be time-consuming for large values of a, b, and c.

**5. Using a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.**

The dynamic programming approach to solving this problem is to build up a table of solutions to smaller subproblems, and then use these solutions to solve the larger problem. This is the most efficient approach to solving this problem, and it can be used to solve the problem for very large values of a, b, and c.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems when solving this problem:

* Make sure you are using the correct formula for checking if a triplet is a primitive Pythagorean triple.
* Check if the numbers in the triplet are coprime.
* Use a divide and conquer or dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.
* Test your code on a variety of inputs to make sure it is correct.

HACKEREARTH sonu-and-monu

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The variable `L` is declared as an integer, but the input is a string. This will cause a type error.
2. **Off-by-one error:** The condition `|a-b| ≤ P` should be `|a-b| < P`. This will cause the program to incorrectly count the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.
3. **Incorrect logic:** The program should count the number of pairs of indices `(a, b)` such that `a < b` and `|a-b| < P`. However, the program is currently counting all pairs of indices, regardless of whether or not they satisfy the condition.
4. **Infinite loop:** The program is currently using a while loop to iterate over all possible pairs of indices. However, this loop will never terminate because there are an infinite number of possible pairs of indices.
5. **Memory leak:** The program is not freeing the memory that it allocates for the string `s`. This will eventually cause the program to run out of memory.

Title:
HACKEREARTH tom-in-gym

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The developer may incorrectly type the variable type, which could lead to errors. For example, if the developer declared a variable as an integer but then tried to assign a floating-point value to it, the program would throw an error.
2. **Off-by-one error:** The developer may accidentally miscount the number of elements in an array or list, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, if the developer tried to access the fifth element of an array that only had four elements, the program would throw an error.
3. **Incorrect loop condition:** The developer may incorrectly set the condition for a loop, which could cause the loop to run indefinitely or not run at all. For example, if the developer set a loop condition to `i < n`, where `n` is the number of elements in an array, the loop would run forever if `n` was zero.
4. **Incorrect logic:** The developer may incorrectly implement the logic for a problem, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, if the developer tried to solve the problem of finding the sum of the first 100 integers by adding the first 100 numbers together, the program would return the wrong answer.
5. **Incorrect data:** The developer may use incorrect data to solve a problem, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, if the developer tried to solve the problem of finding the square root of 4 by using the equation `x^2 = 4`, the program would return the wrong answer.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully check their code for errors before running it. They should also use a debugger to help them identify and fix any problems that they find.

ATCODER p02567 AtCoder Library Practice Contest - Segment Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of segment tree.** The most common mistake is to implement the segment tree incorrectly. This can lead to incorrect results or even runtime errors.
2. **Incorrect use of segment tree.** Another common mistake is to use the segment tree incorrectly. For example, you might try to use the segment tree to find the minimum value in a range, when the segment tree only stores the maximum value.
3. **Insufficient memory.** If the input is large, you might not have enough memory to store the segment tree. This can lead to runtime errors or incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect time complexity.** The segment tree has a time complexity of O(log n) for each query. If you implement the segment tree incorrectly, you might end up with a time complexity of O(n) or worse.
5. **Incorrect space complexity.** The segment tree has a space complexity of O(n). If you implement the segment tree incorrectly, you might end up with a space complexity of O(n^2) or worse.

Title:
ATCODER p02698 AtCoder Beginner Contest 165 - LIS on Tree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrectly computing the longest increasing subsequence**

The longest increasing subsequence (LIS) is a subsequence of a sequence that is strictly increasing. For example, the LIS of the sequence [1, 3, 4, 2, 5] is [1, 3, 4, 5].

To compute the LIS of a sequence, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We first create a table, `lis[i]`, where `lis[i]` stores the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. We then fill in the table in a bottom-up fashion. For each index `i`, we consider all of the previous indices `j` such that `a[j] < a[i]`. If `lis[j] + 1 > lis[i]`, then we update `lis[i]` to `lis[j] + 1`.

Once we have computed the table `lis[i]`, we can find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the original sequence by finding the maximum value of `lis[i]`.

**2. Using an incorrect data structure**

The data structure that you use to store the vertices and edges of the tree can have a significant impact on the performance of your algorithm. For example, if you use an adjacency list, then your algorithm will have to perform a linear search for each edge. This can be very inefficient for large trees.

A better data structure to use is a [union-find data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure). A union-find data structure allows you to quickly find the parent of a vertex and to merge two sets of vertices. This can be used to efficiently find the shortest path from a given vertex to all other vertices in the tree.

**3. Not handling degenerate cases correctly**

There are a few degenerate cases that you need to handle correctly when solving this problem. For example, if the tree is a single vertex, then the longest increasing subsequence is just the single element in the tree.

You also need to handle the case where the tree is not connected. In this case, the longest increasing subsequence for each vertex will be the length of the shortest path from that vertex to any other vertex in the tree.

**4. Insufficient testing**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it to a competition. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed.

When testing your code, you should test it on a variety of different inputs, including inputs that are small, large, and pathological. You should also test your code on inputs that are generated randomly.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs that developers encounter when solving this problem.

Title:
ATCODER p02827 AtCoder Grand Contest 041 - Balancing Network

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect balancing network**

The balancing network is a system of wires and balancers. The wires are numbered from 1 to N from top to bottom, and the balancers are numbered from 1 to M from left to right. Balancer i connects wires x_i and y_i (x_i < y_i).

If the balancer is in the up state, the token moves up to wire x_i and continues moving to the right.

If the balancer is in the down state, the token moves down to wire y_i and continues moving to the right.

If the balancer is in the neutral state, the token doesn't change the wire it's moving along.

A state of the balancing network is called uniforming if a wire w exists such that, regardless of the starting wire, the token will always end up at wire w and run to infinity along it. Any other state is called non-uniforming.

For example, the following is a valid balancing network:

```
N = 4
M = 5
T = 1
x_1 = 1
y_1 = 3
x_2 = 2
y_2 = 4
x_3 = 1
y_3 = 2
x_4 = 3
y_4 = 4
x_5 = 2
y_5 = 3
```

The token starts on wire 1. It moves to wire 3, then to wire 2, then to wire 4, and then to wire 3 again. It will continue to move back and forth between wires 3 and 4 forever.

However, the following is an invalid balancing network:

```
N = 4
M = 5
T = 1
x_1 = 1
y_1 = 3
x_2 = 2
y_2 = 4
x_3 = 1
y_3 = 2
x_4 = 3
y_4 = 4
x_5 = 2
y_5 = 1
```

The token starts on wire 1. It moves to wire 3, then to wire 2, then to wire 1 again. It will never reach wire 4, so it cannot run to infinity along any wire.

**2. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is as follows:

```
N M T
x_1 y_1
x_2 y_2
:
x_M y_M
```

where

* N is the number of wires
* M is the number of balancers
* T is the type of problem (1 for uniforming, 2 for non-uniforming)
* x_i and y_i are the endpoints of the i-th balancer

If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem. For example, the following input is incorrect:

```
N M T
x_1 y_1 x_2 y_2
```

This input is missing the balancer endpoints. The program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

**3. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is as follows:

```
A string of M characters, where the i-th character is `^` if balancer i is in the up state, and `v` if balancer i is in the down state.
```

If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem. For example, the following output is incorrect:

```
1 2 3 4
```

This output is not a string of M characters. The program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

**4. Incorrect balancing network state**

The balancing network state is a string of M characters, where the i-th character is `^` if balancer i is in the up state, and `v` if balancer i is in the down state.

If the balancing network state is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem. For example, the following balancing network state is incorrect:

```
^v^v^
```

This balancing network state has two balancers in the up state and two balancers in the down state. The balancing network state must have either all balancers in the up state or all balancers in the down state.

**5. Incorrect balancing network type**

The balancing network type is either 1 for uniforming or 2 for non-uniforming.

If the balancing network type is incorrect, the program will not be able to
Test inputs:
```

ATCODER p03398 AtCoder Grand Contest 022 - Checkers

Pain points:
The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are:

* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for solving this problem is not trivial, and it is important to make sure that it is implemented correctly. A common mistake is to forget to take into account the fact that the checker pieces are moving on a number line, and to incorrectly compute the distance between two checker pieces.
* **Incorrect use of data structures.** The data structures used to store the checker pieces and their positions must be chosen carefully. A common mistake is to use a data structure that is not efficient for the operations that are performed on it. For example, using a linked list to store the checker pieces would be inefficient, because it would take O(N) time to find the checker piece at a given position.
* **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The input to this problem can contain edge cases, such as N = 1 or N = 2. It is important to make sure that the algorithm handles these edge cases correctly.
* **Incorrect modular arithmetic.** The output of this problem must be a number modulo 10^9 + 7. It is important to make sure that the algorithm correctly computes the modular reduction of the answer.

ATCODER p04039 AtCoder Regular Contest 058 - Iroha's Obsession

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input is given in the format of `N K D_1 D_2 ... D_K`, where `N` is an integer and `D_1, D_2, ..., D_K` are integers. However, if we accidentally use the wrong data type, such as a string, for `N`, we will get a `TypeError`.

**2. Not handling invalid input**

The input constraints state that `1 <= N < 10000` and `1 <= K < 10`. If we accidentally input a value that does not meet these constraints, we will get a `ValueError`.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

The input constraints state that `\{D_1, D_2, ..., D_K\} != \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}`. If we accidentally input a value that does meet this constraint, we will get an incorrect answer.

**4. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The most efficient algorithm for solving this problem is to use a greedy algorithm. However, if we accidentally use a less efficient algorithm, such as a brute-force algorithm, our solution will be slower.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct and works as expected. If you do not test your code, you may accidentally introduce bugs that can cause your program to crash or give incorrect results.

Title:
AIZU p00120 Patisserie

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is specified as follows:

```
W r1 r2 ... rn
```

where `W` is the length of the box and `r1`, `r2`, ..., `rn` are the radii of the roll cakes. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.

2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is given as integers. If the input data is not an integer, the program will crash.

3. **Incorrect range of values**. The radii of the roll cakes must be between 3 and 10. If a radius is outside this range, the program will crash.

4. **Incorrect number of cakes**. The number of cakes must be 12 or less. If the number of cakes is greater than 12, the program will crash.

5. **Inconsistent data**. The radii of the roll cakes must be arranged in ascending order. If the radii are not in ascending order, the program will crash.

6. **Unsolvable problem**. If the roll cakes cannot be arranged in the box in any order, the program will output `NA`.

7. **Off-by-one errors**. When calculating the width of the box, it is important to make sure that you account for the fact that the roll cakes must touch the bottom of the box. If you forget to do this, the program will output the wrong answer.

8. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other possible bugs that could occur when solving this problem. These include:

    * Memory leaks
    * Race conditions
    * Deadlocks
    * Incorrect data structures
    * Incorrect algorithms
    * Incorrect code

It is important to be aware of these possible bugs and to take steps to avoid them when solving this problem.

Title:
AIZU p00439 Maximum Sum

Pain points:
**1. Overflow**

The input data may contain a very large integer. If the sum of k consecutive integers exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the data type, an overflow error may occur. To avoid this, we can use a data type with a larger range, or we can use multiple variables to store the sum of k consecutive integers.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the maximum sum**

The maximum sum of k consecutive integers is not necessarily the sum of the first k integers in the sequence. For example, if the sequence is [-1, 2, 3, -4, 5], the maximum sum of 3 consecutive integers is 7, which is the sum of the integers 2, 3, and 5. To find the maximum sum of k consecutive integers, we need to iterate over all possible subsequences of length k and find the one with the largest sum.

**3. Incorrect input format**

The input data may not be in the correct format. For example, the input may contain a negative value for k, or it may not contain two space-separated integers on the first line. If the input data is not in the correct format, an error may occur.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output should be a single integer that represents the maximum sum of k consecutive integers. If the output is not in the correct format, an error may occur.

**5. Other bugs**

There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. Some common examples include:

* Using the wrong data type to store the sum of k consecutive integers
* Using an incorrect algorithm to find the maximum sum of k consecutive integers
* Not handling incorrect input data correctly
* Not handling errors correctly
* Not following the coding style guidelines of the project

By following these tips, you can help to avoid common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
AIZU p02062 Short Circuit Evaluation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly handling parentheses.** The problem states that `&` is evaluated before `|`, so it is important to make sure that parentheses are used correctly to ensure that the correct order of operations is followed. For example, the expression `(0 & 1) | 0` should be evaluated as `0`, but if parentheses are not used correctly, it could be evaluated as `1`.
2. **Not considering all possible cases.** The problem states that Naodai can pay 1 yen to Hokkaido University to replace a `?` with either `0` or `1`, but it is important to consider all possible cases when determining the minimum amount of money that Naodai needs to pay. For example, if the formula is `? &? |? &? |? &?`, Naodai could pay 1 yen to replace the first `?` with `0` and the second `?` with `1`, or he could pay 2 yen to replace the first `?` with `1` and the second `?` with `0`. In this case, the minimum amount of money that Naodai needs to pay is 2.
3. **Using incorrect data types.** The problem states that the length of the formula does not exceed 2 \times 10^5, but it is important to make sure that the data types used to store the formula are large enough to handle this size. For example, if the formula is `100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, it would not be possible to store it in a variable of type `int`.
4. **Not handling errors correctly.** The problem does not specify what should happen if an error occurs, so it is important to handle errors correctly. For example, if the formula is not well-formed, it could cause a syntax error. In this case, it would be appropriate to print an error message and exit the program.
