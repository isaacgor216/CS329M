CODECHEF ababaaba

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of substring() method**

The substring() method returns a substring of a string starting at the specified index and ending at the specified index. If the second index is not specified, it defaults to the end of the string. For example, the following code will print the substring "ab" from the string "abcdef":

```
>>> s = "abcdef"
>>> print(s[0:2])
ab
```

However, if the second index is greater than the length of the string, the substring() method will return an empty string. For example, the following code will print the empty string from the string "abcdef":

```
>>> s = "abcdef"
>>> print(s[0:10])
```

This can be a problem if you are trying to find a substring that occurs twice in a string. For example, the following code will not find the substring "ab" in the string "abcdef":

```
>>> s = "abcdef"
>>> if s.find("ab") == s.rfind("ab"):
...     print("ab found twice")
... else:
...     print("ab not found twice")
...
ab not found twice
```

The problem is that the substring() method only returns the first occurrence of the substring. To find all occurrences of a substring, you can use the finditer() method. The finditer() method returns an iterator over all the occurrences of the substring in the string. For example, the following code will find all occurrences of the substring "ab" in the string "abcdef":

```
>>> s = "abcdef"
>>> for match in s.finditer("ab"):
...     print(match.start(), match.end())
...
0 2
```

**2. Incorrect use of enumerate() method**

The enumerate() method returns an enumerate object that contains the index and value of each element in a sequence. For example, the following code will print the index and value of each element in the list [1, 2, 3]:

```
>>> list = [1, 2, 3]
>>> for i, value in enumerate(list):
...     print(i, value)
...
0 1
1 2
2 3
```

The enumerate() method can be used to find all occurrences of a substring in a string. For example, the following code will find all occurrences of the substring "ab" in the string "abcdef":

```
>>> s = "abcdef"
>>> for i, value in enumerate(s):
...     if value == "a" and s[i + 1] == "b":
...         print(i)
...
0
2
```

However, if you are not careful, you can make a mistake when using the enumerate() method. For example, the following code will not find all occurrences of the substring "ab" in the string "abcdef":

```
>>> s = "abcdef"
>>> for i, value in enumerate(s):
...     if value == "a" and s[i + 1] == "b":
...         print(i + 1)
...
1
3
```

The problem is that the enumerate() method starts at index 0, so the second element of the string is at index 1. This means that the code will only find the second occurrence of the substring "ab". To find all occurrences of the substring, you need to start the index at 1.

**3. Incorrect use of in operator**

The in operator checks if an item is in a sequence. For example, the following code will check if the letter "a" is in the string "abcdef":

```
>>> s = "abcdef"
>>> "a" in s
True
```

The in operator can also be used to check if a substring is in a string. For example, the following code will check if the substring "ab" is in the string "abcdef":

```
>>> s = "abcdef"
>>> "ab" in s
True
```

However, if you are not careful, you can make a mistake when using the in operator. For example, the following code will not work as expected:

```
>>> s = "abcdef"
>>> "abcd" in s
False
```

The problem is that the in operator only checks for an exact match. This means that the code will only find the substring "abcd" if it is exactly the same as the string

Title:
CODECHEF chefeq

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct.**

The input format is described as follows:

```
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of piles.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the number of coins in each pile.
```

However, the following input is not correct:

```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

The input format should be:

```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

**2. The output format is not correct.**

The output format is described as follows:

```
For each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the minimum number of operations assistant needs to do.
```

However, the following output is not correct:

```
3
```

The output format should be:

```
3
```

**3. The program does not handle all test cases.**

The program should handle all test cases. However, the following program does not handle the following test case:

```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

The program should output `3`, but it outputs `4`.

**4. The program has a bug.**

The program has a bug. For example, the following program has a bug:

```
def main():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        min_val = min(a)
        max_val = max(a)
        print(min(n, max_val - min_val))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

The bug is that the program does not handle the case where all the piles have the same number of coins. In this case, the program should output `0`, but it outputs `1`.

Title:
CODECHEF ngame

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The problem statement mentions that `N` is an integer, but the code below uses `N` as a float. This will cause the code to produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect logic:** The code below checks if `N` is divisible by 4. If it is, it prints `"First"`. If it is not, it subtracts 1, 2, or 3 from `N` and checks if the resulting number is divisible by 4. If it is, it prints `"First"`. If it is not, it prints `"Second"`. This logic is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that Nikhil can also make a move.
3. **Off-by-one error:** The code below checks if `N - 1` is divisible by 4. However, this check is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that `N` is already divisible by 4.
4. **Infinite loop:** The code below contains an infinite loop. This is because the `while` loop will never terminate because `N` is always less than or equal to 3.

To fix these problems, we can do the following:

1. Change the variable type of `N` to `int`.
2. Correct the logic of the code so that it takes into account the fact that Nikhil can also make a move.
3. Fix the off-by-one error.
4. Remove the infinite loop.

Here is the corrected code:

```
def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 4 == 0:
            print("First")
        else:
            print("Second")

Title:
CODECHEF sdsquare

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of data types**. The problem states that the input numbers are positive integers, but the code below uses `int` data type, which can only store numbers up to 2147483647. This can lead to incorrect results if the input numbers are larger than this.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. The code below uses the following logic to find the perfect squares between `a` and `b`:

```
for i in range(a, b + 1):
    if is_perfect_square(i):
        count += 1
```

This logic will not work correctly if `a` is a perfect square, because it will skip the first perfect square in the range. To fix this, we can use the following logic:

```
for i in range(a + 1, b + 1):
    if is_perfect_square(i):
        count += 1
```

3. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers**. The problem states that the input numbers are positive integers, but the code below uses `float` data types to store them. This can lead to incorrect results if the input numbers are not exactly integers. To fix this, we can use the following code to convert the input numbers to integers:

```
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
```

4. **Incorrect use of mathematical functions**. The code below uses the following function to check if a number is a perfect square:

```
def is_perfect_square(n):
    return math.sqrt(n) % 1 == 0
```

This function is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that negative numbers can also be perfect squares. To fix this, we can use the following function:

```
def is_perfect_square(n):
    return n >= 0 and math.sqrt(n) % 1 == 0
```

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correctly specified. For example, the output may contain a float instead of an integer.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating over an array, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one element or count it twice.
4. **Arithmetic errors**. When performing arithmetic operations, it is easy to make a mistake and get the wrong answer.
5. **Memory errors**. When allocating memory for an array or a data structure, it is easy to make a mistake and allocate too much or too little memory. This can lead to a segmentation fault or a runtime error.
6. **Race conditions**. When multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is possible for them to interfere with each other and produce incorrect results.
7. **Deadlocks**. When multiple threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, it is possible for them to get stuck in a deadlock and never make progress.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. When writing code, it is important to take security into account. For example, it is important to protect against buffer overflows and other attacks.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1025_E. Colored Cubes

Pain points:
**1. Input format**

The first line contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n` ≤ 50).

Each of the next `m` lines contains two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (1 ≤ `x_i`, `y_i` ≤ `n`), the initial positions of the cubes.

The next `m` lines describe the designated places for the cubes in the same format and order.

It is guaranteed that all initial positions are distinct and all designated places are distinct, however, it is possible that some initial positions coincide with some final positions.

**2. Output format**

In the first line print a single integer `k` (0 ≤ `k` ≤ 10800) — the number of operations Vasya should make.

In each of the next `k` lines you should describe one operation: print four integers `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, `y_2`, where `x_1`, `y_1` is the position of the cube Vasya should move, and `x_2`, `y_2` is the new position of the cube. The cells `x_1`, `y_1` and `x_2`, `y_2` should have a common side, the cell `x_2`, `y_2` should be empty before the operation.

We can show that there always exists at least one solution. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

**3. Possible problems**

* The input data may not be valid. For example, the number of cubes may be greater than the number of cells in the chessboard.
* The input data may contain duplicate values. For example, two cubes may have the same initial position.
* The input data may contain invalid values. For example, a cube may be placed outside the chessboard.
* The output data may not be valid. For example, the number of operations may be negative or greater than 10800.
* The output data may contain duplicate values. For example, two operations may move the same cube to the same position.
* The output data may contain invalid values. For example, an operation may move a cube to a cell that is not empty.

**4. Possible bugs**

* The developer may not check the validity of the input data. This could lead to errors in the output data.
* The developer may not check for duplicate values in the input data. This could lead to errors in the output data.
* The developer may not check for invalid values in the input data. This could lead to errors in the output data.
* The developer may not check for duplicate values in the output data. This could lead to errors in the output data.
* The developer may not check for invalid values in the output data. This could lead to errors in the output data.

CODEFORCES 106_A. Card Game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain the trump suit, and the second line should contain the description of the two different cards. However, a developer may accidentally mistype the input format, or the input may be malformed in some other way. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect logic.** The program must correctly implement the rules of the card game in order to determine whether the first card beats the second card. A developer may make a mistake in their implementation of the rules, which could lead to incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect error handling.** The program should handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input format is incorrect, the program should print an error message and exit. A developer may forget to handle errors correctly, which could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
4. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program should be secure against malicious input. For example, a developer should not allow the user to input arbitrary code, as this could lead to a security vulnerability.
5. **Performance issues.** The program should be efficient and should not take too long to run. A developer may make optimizations that improve the performance of the program, or they may make mistakes that slow down the program.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1139_F. Dish Shopping

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type.** The input data is given as a string, but the problem requires the data to be integers. This can be fixed by using the `int()` function to convert the strings to integers.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator.** The problem states that `p_i ≤ inc_j ≤ s_i`, but the code compares `p_i <= inc_j <= s_i`. This can be fixed by changing the comparison operator to `<=`.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The code checks if `b_i-pref_j| <= (inc_j-p_i)`, but the problem states that `|b_i-pref_j| ≤ (inc_j-p_i)`. This can be fixed by changing the inequality sign to `<=`.
4. **Off-by-one error.** The code prints the number of dishes that can be bought by each person, but the problem requires the output to be the indices of the dishes that can be bought. This can be fixed by adding one to each index before printing it.
5. **Memory leak.** The code does not free the memory allocated for the `dishes` and `people` arrays. This can be fixed by calling the `free()` function on these arrays when they are no longer needed.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
p = list(map(int, input().split()))
s = list(map(int, input().split()))
b = list(map(int, input().split()))
inc = list(map(int, input().split()))

1. **Incorrect input format.**

```
3
001
110
000
```

This input is incorrect because it does not have a newline character at the end of the third line. This will cause the program to read the first two lines as a single line, and it will not be able to parse the input correctly.

2. **Incorrect data type.**

```
5
01010
10000
00001
01010
10000
```

This input is incorrect because the first line contains a number that is not an integer. This will cause the program to crash.

3. **Incorrect logic.**

```
5
01111
00000
01000
01100
01110
```

This input is incorrect because there is no cycle of length three in the graph. The program will print an incorrect output, such as `1 2 3`.

4. **Incorrect output format.**

```
5
01111
00000
01000
01100
01110
```

This input is incorrect because the output contains spaces between the numbers. The correct output should be `123`.

5. **Other errors.**

```
5
01111
00000

CODEFORCES 1198_D. Rectangle Painting 1

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a square grid of size n × n. Some cells are colored in black, all others are colored in white. In one operation you can select some rectangle and color all its cells in white. It costs max(h, w) to color a rectangle of size h × w. You are to make all cells white for minimum total cost.

The data type used to store the grid should be able to hold the maximum value of max(h, w). Since max(h, w) = n, the data type should be able to hold the value n.

For example, if n = 100, the data type should be able to hold the value 100. If the data type is int, which can only hold values up to 2^31-1, an overflow error will occur.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The naive algorithm for solving this problem is to iterate over all possible rectangles and find the one with the minimum cost. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^4).

A more efficient algorithm is to use dynamic programming. The idea is to create a table T[i][j] where T[i][j] stores the minimum cost to paint the first i rows and the first j columns white. The table can be filled in bottom-up fashion.

**3. Insufficient test cases**

When testing your code, it is important to use a variety of test cases. This will help you to identify bugs that you may have missed.

For example, you should test your code with different values of n. You should also test your code with grids that contain both black and white cells.

**4. Incorrect output**

When you run your code, make sure that the output is correct. You can check the output by hand or by using a tool like [Tester](https://tester.codeforces.com/).

**5. Coding errors**

When you are writing your code, it is important to pay attention to details. Make sure that you use the correct syntax and that your code is well-structured.

For example, you should use spaces around operators and parentheses. You should also break your code into multiple functions.

**6. Runtime errors**

When you run your code, it is possible that you will get a runtime error. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as:

* Using an uninitialized variable
* Dividing by zero
* Accessing a memory location that is out of bounds

If you get a runtime error, you should try to debug your code to find the cause of the error.

CODEFORCES 1215_C. Swap Letters

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. This could result in the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect string comparison**. The program may compare strings incorrectly, resulting in incorrect output. For example, the program may compare strings lexicographically instead of character-by-character.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The program may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem, resulting in incorrect output. For example, the program may try to swap characters in the strings in the wrong order.
4. **Incorrect error handling**. The program may not handle errors correctly, resulting in the program crashing or producing incorrect output. For example, the program may not handle the case where the strings are not equal.
5. **Incorrect output format**. The program may not output the results in the correct format, resulting in the program being marked incorrect. For example, the program may not print the number of operations required to make the strings equal, or it may print the operations in the wrong order.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1238_E. Keyboard Purchase

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format specified in the problem statement is:

```
The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 20).

The second line contains the string s consisting of n characters. Each character is one of the first m Latin letters (lowercase).
```

A developer may incorrectly parse the input and expect the first line to contain a single integer n, followed by the string s on the second line. This would result in an incorrect answer.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the slowness**

The slowness of a keyboard is calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the differences between the positions of each consecutive pair of characters in the password. For example, if the password is "abc" and the keyboard is "bac", then the slowness is |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 = 3.

A developer may incorrectly calculate the slowness by summing the absolute values of the differences between the characters in the password, rather than the positions of the characters. This would result in an incorrect answer.

**3. Incorrect use of the array indices**

The array indices in the code should start at 0, not 1. For example, if the password is "abc" and the keyboard is "bac", then the position of the letter "a" in the keyboard is 0, not 1.

A developer may incorrectly use the array indices starting at 1, which would result in an incorrect answer.

**4. Incorrect use of the modulo operator**

The modulo operator (%) should be used to wrap the array indices around to the beginning of the array. For example, if the array has size 5 and the array index is 6, then the modulo operator should be used to calculate the new array index as 6 % 5 = 1.

A developer may incorrectly use the modulo operator to calculate the new array index as 6 - 5 = 1, which would result in an incorrect answer.

**5. Incorrect use of the comparison operators**

The comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) should be used to compare the values of two variables, not the strings that the variables represent. For example, if the two variables a and b both contain the string "a", then the expression a == b will return true, even though the values of the variables are not equal.

A developer may incorrectly use the comparison operators to compare the strings that the variables represent, which would result in an incorrect answer.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1406_D. Three Sequences

Pain points:
**Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs**

1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem is asking you to find two sequences `b` and `c` such that `b_i + c_i = a_i` for all `i`, `b` is non-decreasing, and `c` is non-increasing. You may have incorrectly assumed that `b` and `c` must be non-negative, or that `b` and `c` must be equal.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for finding `b` and `c` is relatively simple, but it is easy to make mistakes. Some common mistakes include:
    * Using the wrong order of operations when computing `b_i + c_i`.
    * Forgetting to update `b` and `c` when a change is made to `a`.
    * Using an incorrect data structure to store `b` and `c`.
3. **Incorrect testing.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. Some common testing methods include:
    * Manually testing small cases.
    * Using a test generator to create random test cases.
    * Using a debugger to step through your code.

CODEFORCES 1427_E. Xum

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input integer x is odd and can be in the range [3, 999,999]. If we use an integer data type to store x, we may get an overflow error when x is large. To avoid this, we can use a long long data type to store x.

**2. Using the wrong operator**

The problem statement says that we can perform the following two operations:

* We may take two numbers (not necessarily distinct) already on the blackboard and write their sum on the blackboard.
* We may take two numbers (not necessarily distinct) already on the blackboard and write their bitwise XOR on the blackboard.

If we use the wrong operator, we may get an incorrect answer. For example, if we use the addition operator instead of the bitwise XOR operator, we may get an incorrect answer.

**3. Not handling the corner cases**

The problem statement says that we can perform at most 100,000 operations. If we do not handle this corner case, our program may run into an infinite loop.

**4. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The problem statement says that we can perform at most 100,000 operations. If we use an inefficient algorithm, our program may not finish in time. To avoid this, we can use a more efficient algorithm, such as the following algorithm:

1. Initialize a set S to be empty.
2. While the number of elements in S is less than 2:
    * Add x to S.
    * x = x ^ (x - 1).
3. For each pair of elements (a, b) in S, perform the following operation:
    * a = a + b.
    * b = a ^ b.
4. Print the number of operations performed.

This algorithm is guaranteed to terminate in at most 100,000 operations.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1523_E. Crypto Lights

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm

The most common mistake is to implement the algorithm incorrectly. This can happen for a number of reasons, such as:

* Misunderstanding the problem statement
* Making a mistake in the implementation
* Using incorrect data types
* Not handling corner cases correctly

To avoid this, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement before starting to implement the algorithm. It is also helpful to write out the algorithm in pseudocode before implementing it in code. This will help to catch any mistakes in the logic before they are introduced into the code.

### 2. Using incorrect data types

Another common mistake is to use incorrect data types. This can lead to errors in the calculation of the expected value. For example, if the expected value is a floating-point number, but it is stored in an integer variable, the value will be truncated and the result will be incorrect.

To avoid this, it is important to use the correct data types for the values being calculated. For example, if the expected value is a floating-point number, it should be stored in a floating-point variable.

### 3. Not handling corner cases correctly

Corner cases are special cases that can occur in the input data that the algorithm is not expecting. If these cases are not handled correctly, the algorithm may produce incorrect results.

For example, if the input data contains a negative number, the algorithm may crash or produce incorrect results. To avoid this, it is important to check the input data for corner cases and handle them appropriately.

### 4. Using a brute-force approach

A brute-force approach is an algorithm that tries every possible solution to a problem. This can be very time-consuming, especially for large problems.

For example, if the problem is to find the shortest path between two points on a map, a brute-force approach would try every possible path between the two points. This would be very time-consuming, especially if the map is large.

To avoid this, it is important to use an efficient algorithm that only considers a small number of possible solutions.

### 5. Not using the modulo operator correctly

The modulo operator (%) is used to find the remainder of a division operation. This can be useful for problems where the answer needs to be rounded to a certain number of digits.

For example, if the expected value is 100 and the modulo operator is used with a modulus of 10, the result will be rounded to the nearest multiple of 10. This can be useful for problems where the answer needs to be expressed in a certain number of digits.

To avoid errors, it is important to understand how the modulo operator works and to use it correctly.

CODEFORCES 155_D. Colliders

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always strictly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of colliders is not a positive integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also important. For example, if the responses to the requests are not printed in the correct format, the program will not be accepted.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program should be correct. For example, if the program does not check if the collider is already activated before activating it, it will crash.
4. **Incorrect data structures**. The data structures used in the program should be appropriate for the task. For example, if the program uses a linked list to store the activated colliders, it will be inefficient.
5. **Incorrect algorithms**. The algorithms used in the program should be efficient. For example, if the program uses a brute-force algorithm to find the prime factors of a number, it will be very slow.
6. **Incorrect debugging**. It is important to debug the program carefully before submitting it. For example, if the program crashes when a certain input is given, it is important to find the bug and fix it.
7. **Incorrect testing**. It is important to test the program thoroughly before submitting it. For example, the program should be tested with different input values and different collider configurations.

By following these tips, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving the Colliders problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 365_B. The Fibonacci Segment

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types:** The input data is an array of integers, so the developer should use `int` or `long long` to store the elements of the array. Using `float` or `double` to store the elements of the array may lead to incorrect results.
2. **Using incorrect indexes:** The indexes of the elements of the array start from 1, so the developer should be careful not to use incorrect indexes. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  // Do something with a[i]
}
```

The correct code should be:

```
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
  // Do something with a[i]
}
```

3. **Not handling the edge cases:** The input data may contain some edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with all elements equal to 0. The developer should be careful to handle these edge cases correctly.
4. **Using incorrect algorithms:** The developer should use an efficient algorithm to solve the problem. Using an inefficient algorithm may lead to a timeout.
5. **Not testing the code:** It is important to test the code thoroughly before submitting it. This will help to catch any bugs that may be present in the code.
Test inputs:
**Incorrect data types:**

a = list(map(int, input().split()))
if n == 0:
  print(0)
elif n == 1:
  print(1)
else:
  print(2)
```

**Using incorrect algorithms:**

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
for i in range(n):
  for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    if i == 0 or j == i + 1:
      dp[i][j] = 1
    elif a[i] == a[j - 1] + a[j - 2]:
      dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 2] + 1
    else:
      dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j - 1], dp[i + 1][j])

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific. The first line should contain the name of the current month, and the second line should contain an integer representing the number of months until Codecraft III is released. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of months until Codecraft III is released.** The number of months until Codecraft III is released is calculated by subtracting the current month from the release month. However, if the current month is after the release month, the number of months until Codecraft III is released will be negative. This can cause the program to output an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect output format.** The output for this problem should be the name of the month in which Codecraft III will be released. The name of the month should be capitalized, and it should be followed by a newline character. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
4. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other potential bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:
    * Using the wrong data type to store the number of months until Codecraft III is released.
    * Using an incorrect algorithm to calculate the number of months until Codecraft III is released.
    * Using an incorrect algorithm to output the name of the month in which Codecraft III will be released.
    * Making a mistake in the code.

By being aware of these potential problems, developers can avoid them and ensure that their programs correctly solve the problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 480_E. Parking Lot

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly and that you are not missing any of the required information. For example, if you forget to read the number of rows and columns in the parking lot, your program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem is also very specific. You need to print k integers, one for each of the arriving cars. Each integer should be the length of the side of the maximum square of empty spots after the corresponding car has entered the parking lot. If there is no maximum square of empty spots, you should print 0.

**3. Overflow errors**

When working with large numbers, it is important to be aware of the possibility of overflow errors. This can happen when you try to add two very large numbers together or when you try to multiply a very large number by a very small number. To avoid overflow errors, you should always use the appropriate data types and you should be careful about the order of operations.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that can occur when you are working with arrays or other data structures. This type of error occurs when you forget to add or subtract one from an index, which can result in incorrect results. To avoid off-by-one errors, you should always be careful about the indices that you are using and you should make sure that you are not accidentally skipping or repeating elements.

**5. Logical errors**

Logical errors are a type of bug that occurs when your program is not doing what you intended it to do. This type of error can be caused by a variety of factors, such as incorrect assumptions, incorrect logic, or incorrect implementation. To avoid logical errors, you should always carefully review your code and make sure that it is doing what you intended it to do.

CODEFORCES 505_E. Mr. Kitayuta vs. Bamboos

Pain points:
```
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem states that "It is possible to beat the same bamboo more than once in a day". However, some developers may mistakenly assume that each bamboo can only be beaten once per day. This can lead to incorrect solutions.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for finding the lowest possible height of the tallest bamboo after m days is relatively straightforward. However, some developers may make mistakes in their implementation, such as using the wrong data types or making incorrect calculations. This can lead to incorrect solutions.
3. **Incorrect testing.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. Some developers may not test their solution thoroughly enough, which can lead to bugs being missed. This can lead to incorrect solutions being submitted to the competition.
4. **Incorrect submission.** Once you have developed a correct and tested solution, it is important to submit it to the competition correctly. Some developers may make mistakes in their submission, such as forgetting to include the source code or submitting the wrong file. This can lead to their solution not being accepted by the competition.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that developers may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect understanding of the problem:** A developer may mistakenly assume that each bamboo can only be beaten once per day. This can lead to a solution that does not minimize the height of the tallest bamboo.
* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm:** A developer may make mistakes in their implementation of the algorithm, such as using the wrong data types or making incorrect calculations. This can lead to a solution that does not minimize the height of the tallest bamboo.
* **Incorrect testing:** A developer may not test their solution thoroughly enough, which can lead to bugs being missed. This can lead to a solution that does not minimize the height of the tallest bamboo.
* **Incorrect submission:** A developer may make mistakes in their submission, such as forgetting to include the source code or submitting the wrong file. This can lead to their solution not being accepted by the competition.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement, implement the algorithm correctly, test your solution thoroughly, and submit your solution correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 602_D. Lipshitz Sequence

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem is about Lipschitz constants, which are defined as the smallest non-negative integer such that |h[i] - h[j]| ≤ L·|i - j| holds for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. This means that the Lipschitz constant of a subarray is the maximum difference between any two elements in the subarray divided by the length of the subarray.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for computing the Lipschitz constant of a subarray is as follows:

   1. Initialize an array L of size n+1, where L[i] is the Lipschitz constant of the subarray [1, i].
   2. For each i from 1 to n, compute L[i+1] as the maximum of L[i] and |h[i] - h[i-1]|.

3. **Incorrect test cases.** The test cases should be carefully designed to test all possible cases of the input. For example, the test cases should include cases where the input array is empty, the input array has only one element, and the input array has two elements that are equal.
4. **Incorrect submission.** The submission should be correctly formatted and should follow the instructions in the problem statement. For example, the submission should include the correct header and should print the output in the correct format.
5. **Missing or incorrect comments.** The code should be well-commented to make it easy for other developers to understand. For example, the comments should explain the purpose of each function and each variable.
6. **Inefficient algorithm.** The algorithm for computing the Lipschitz constant of a subarray can be inefficient. For example, the naive algorithm takes O(n^2) time.
7. **Memory leak.** The code should be free of memory leaks. For example, the code should close any open files or sockets.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always followed strictly, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a space between two numbers, the program may interpret them as two separate numbers, which will lead to incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect calculation of time**

The time is calculated by adding the number of seconds to the start time. However, if the number of seconds is negative, the program may overflow and give an incorrect result.

**3. Incorrect handling of leap years**

The program must take into account the fact that leap years have 366 days, not 365. If this is not done, the program will give incorrect results for dates in leap years.

**4. Incorrect handling of days of the week**

The days of the week are numbered starting from Monday, not Sunday. If this is not taken into account, the program will give incorrect results for dates that fall on a weekend.

**5. Incorrect handling of months**

The months are numbered starting from January, not March. If this is not taken into account, the program will give incorrect results for dates that fall in the first two months of the year.

**6. Incorrect handling of years**

The years are numbered starting from 1970, not 0. If this is not taken into account, the program will give incorrect results for dates that fall in years before 1970.

CODEFORCES 71_A. Way Too Long Words

Pain points:
1. The input may contain invalid data, such as a negative number of words, a word with more than 100 characters, or a word that contains non-lowercase Latin letters. The developer should check the input for validity and handle invalid input appropriately.
2. The output may contain invalid data, such as a word that is not an abbreviation or a word that is not the same length as the input word. The developer should check the output for validity and handle invalid output appropriately.
3. The developer may not correctly implement the algorithm for generating abbreviations. The abbreviation should be made by writing down the first and last letter of the word and between them writing the number of letters between the first and last letters. The number should be in decimal system and should not contain any leading zeroes.
4. The developer may not correctly implement the algorithm for printing the output. The output should be printed one line per word, and each line should contain the result of replacing the corresponding input word.
5. The developer may not correctly handle the case where the input word is already an abbreviation. In this case, the output should be the same as the input.

CODEFORCES 740_C. Alyona and mex

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if you forget to add a newline character at the end of the output, the program may crash.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum mex**. The minimum mex is the smallest possible non-negative integer that is not in the set. It is easy to make a mistake when calculating the minimum mex, especially if the set is large.
4. **Incorrect choice of the array elements**. The array elements must be between 0 and 109. It is easy to make a mistake when choosing the array elements, especially if the array is large.
5. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**. The algorithm for finding the maximum possible minimum mex is not trivial. It is easy to make a mistake when implementing the algorithm, especially if the algorithm is complex.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to carefully check your code for errors before submitting it.

CODEFORCES 764_B. Timofey and cubes

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of integers. If we use the wrong data type to store the input data, it may cause problems. For example, if we use a string to store the input data, we will get a runtime error.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The correct algorithm to solve this problem is to use a stack. However, if we use an incorrect algorithm, it may cause the program to run into infinite loop or give incorrect output.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The logic of the program should be correct. If the logic is incorrect, it may cause the program to give incorrect output.

**4. Not handling corner cases**

The program should handle all corner cases. For example, if the input data is empty, the program should print an empty list.

**5. Not using appropriate data structures**

The program should use appropriate data structures to store the data. For example, if the input data is a list of integers, we should use a list to store the data.

**6. Not using appropriate algorithms**

The program should use appropriate algorithms to solve the problem. For example, if the problem is to find the shortest path in a graph, we should use Dijkstra's algorithm.

**7. Not testing the program**

The program should be tested thoroughly before it is released. This can be done by writing unit tests and integration tests.

**8. Not documenting the program**

The program should be well-documented. This can be done by writing comments in the code and by creating a user manual.

Title:
CODEFORCES 787_D. Legacy

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable types**. The input is a list of integers, but the code is expecting a list of strings. This can be fixed by changing the type of the input list to `list(map(int, input().split()))`.
2. **Incorrect variable names**. The variables `v`, `u`, `w`, `l`, `r`, and `s` are not descriptive and could be confusing to other developers. It would be better to use names that more clearly indicate what they represent, such as `source`, `destination`, `cost`, `start`, `end`, and `earth`.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code is not correctly calculating the minimum cost to get from earth to each planet. For example, in the first sample test case, the code returns `0` for planet 1, but it should actually be `17` because Rick needs to purchase the 4th plan in order to get to planet 1.
4. **Unnecessary code**. The code includes a lot of unnecessary code, such as the `for` loop that iterates over the list of plans. This code can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program.
5. **Inefficient code**. The code can be significantly improved by using a more efficient data structure, such as a priority queue. This would allow the code to find the minimum cost to get to each planet in a more efficient way.

Here are some specific suggestions for how to improve the code:

1. Use the `map()` function to convert the input list to a list of integers.
2. Use more descriptive variable names.
3. Correct the logic for calculating the minimum cost to get from earth to each planet.
4. Remove the unnecessary `for` loop.
5. Use a more efficient data structure, such as a priority queue.

CODEFORCES 809_A. Do you want a date?

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly parsed by the program. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values may not be correctly specified. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are common in programming, and can lead to incorrect results. For example, if you are iterating over a list of numbers, and you forget to increment the index by one, you will miss the last element in the list.
4. **Arithmetic errors**. Arithmetic errors can occur when performing calculations on floating-point numbers. For example, the expression `0.1 + 0.2` does not equal `0.3` exactly, due to rounding errors.
5. **Logic errors**. Logic errors occur when the program does not behave as expected. For example, if you are trying to sort a list of numbers, but you use the wrong sorting algorithm, the list will not be sorted correctly.
6. **Memory errors**. Memory errors can occur when the program allocates too much or too little memory. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
7. **Concurrency errors**. Concurrency errors can occur when multiple threads of execution are accessing the same data at the same time. This can lead to data corruption or incorrect results.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can occur when the program does not properly protect its data from unauthorized access. This can allow attackers to steal or modify data, or to execute malicious code.
9. **Usability errors**. Usability errors occur when the program is difficult to use or understand. This can lead to users making mistakes, which can result in incorrect results or data loss.
10. **Performance errors**. Performance errors occur when the program runs slowly or uses too much resources. This can make the program unusable for users with limited resources.

Title:
CODEFORCES 833_D. Red-Black Cobweb

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data types of the input and output values must match the ones specified in the problem statement. For example, if the input values are integers, the output values must also be integers. Otherwise, the program will produce incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating over an array or a list, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one or more elements. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be correct in order to produce the correct output. A common mistake is to forget to account for all possible cases. For example, if the problem statement says that the input values must be non-negative, the program must check for negative values and handle them appropriately.
5. **Memory leaks**. When a program allocates memory, it must free that memory when it is no longer needed. If a program does not free memory that it has allocated, it will eventually run out of memory and crash.
6. **Race conditions**. A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same shared resource at the same time. This can lead to incorrect behavior or even a crash.
7. **Deadlocks**. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource that they both need. This can also lead to a crash.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. A security vulnerability is a weakness in the program that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system. Security vulnerabilities can be introduced in many ways, such as through incorrect input validation, insecure coding practices, or design flaws.

Title:
CODEFORCES 902_B. Coloring a Tree

Pain points:
**Possible problems**

* **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of vertices is not a positive integer, the program will crash.
* **Incorrect data**. The data given in the input may not be correct, which can also lead to errors in the program. For example, if the graph is not a tree, the program will not be able to find a solution.
* **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may not be correct, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the algorithm does not take into account all of the constraints of the problem, it may not find a valid solution.
* **Incorrect implementation**. The program may be incorrectly implemented, which can lead to errors in the output. For example, if the program does not correctly handle edge cases, it may produce incorrect results.

**Possible bugs**

* **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a vertex being colored with the wrong color.
* **Null pointer exceptions**. Null pointer exceptions occur when a programmer tries to access a memory address that does not contain a valid value. This can lead to the program crashing.
* **ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException**. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions occur when a programmer tries to access an element of an array that is out of bounds. This can lead to the program crashing.
* **Arithmetic overflow**. Arithmetic overflow occurs when a programmer performs an arithmetic operation that results in a value that is too large to be represented by the data type being used. This can lead to the program crashing.
* **Data races**. Data races occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.

**How to avoid these problems**

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully follow the input format and to check the data for correctness. It is also important to use a correct algorithm and to implement the program correctly. Finally, it is important to test the program thoroughly to catch any errors.

Title:
CODEFORCES 924_D. Contact ATC

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the binary search algorithm**

The binary search algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that can be used to find the position of a target value in a sorted array. However, if the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results.

One common mistake is to use the wrong comparison operator in the while loop. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
while (left <= right) {
  mid = (left + right) / 2;
  if (target < arr[mid]) {
    right = mid - 1;
  } else if (target > arr[mid]) {
    left = mid + 1;
  } else {
    // Found the target!
    break;
  }
}
```

The problem with this code is that the comparison operator `<` is used instead of the correct operator `<=`. This means that the loop will terminate early if the target value is found in the array.

To fix this problem, simply change the comparison operator to `<=`:

```
while (left <= right) {
  mid = (left + right) / 2;
  if (target <= arr[mid]) {
    right = mid - 1;
  } else {
    left = mid + 1;
  }
}
```

**2. Using an incorrect data structure**

Another common mistake is to use an incorrect data structure to store the data. For example, if you are trying to find the maximum value in an array, you should use a `maxheap` instead of a `minheap`.

A `maxheap` is a data structure that stores the elements in a tree such that the root element is always the largest element in the heap. This makes it easy to find the maximum value in the heap in O(1) time.

A `minheap`, on the other hand, stores the elements in a tree such that the root element is always the smallest element in the heap. This makes it easy to find the minimum value in the heap in O(1) time.

If you use a `minheap` to find the maximum value in an array, it will take O(n) time, because you will need to iterate through the entire heap to find the largest element.

To avoid this problem, make sure to use the correct data structure for the task at hand.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

Another common mistake is to not handle edge cases. For example, if you are trying to find the maximum value in an array, you need to handle the case where the array is empty.

The following code will not work correctly if the array is empty:

```
int findMax(int[] arr) {
  int max = arr[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] > max) {
      max = arr[i];
    }
  }
  return max;
}
```

The problem with this code is that it will throw a `NullPointerException` if the array is empty.

To fix this problem, you need to check if the array is empty before trying to access any of its elements.

The following code will work correctly even if the array is empty:

```
int findMax(int[] arr) {
  if (arr.length == 0) {
    return Integer.MIN_VALUE;
  }

  int max = arr[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] > max) {
      max = arr[i];
    }
  }
  return max;
}

Title:
CODEFORCES 952_F. 2 + 2 != 4

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect operator precedence.** The order of operations in an arithmetic expression is important. For example, `2 + 2 * 3` evaluates to 8, not 10. Make sure that you are using the correct operator precedence when evaluating the expression.
2. **Incorrect operands.** The operands in an arithmetic expression must be valid numbers. For example, `2 + "hello"` is not a valid expression. Make sure that all of the operands in your expression are valid numbers.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** It is easy to make a mistake when counting or adding numbers. Make sure that you are careful when performing these operations.
4. **Divide by zero errors.** Dividing by zero is undefined, and will cause your program to crash. Make sure that you check for division by zero before performing the operation.
5. **Memory errors.** If you allocate too much memory, your program will crash. Make sure that you are careful when allocating and freeing memory.
6. **File errors.** If you open a file incorrectly, or try to read from or write to a file that does not exist, your program will crash. Make sure that you are opening files correctly and that the files exist before you try to access them.
7. **Synchronization errors.** If multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time, it is possible for them to corrupt the data. Make sure that you are using synchronization mechanisms to prevent this from happening.
8. **Security vulnerabilities.** If your program is not secure, it may be vulnerable to attack. Make sure that you are using secure coding practices to protect your program from attack.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific. Make sure that you are reading the input correctly and that your code is handling all possible cases.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. The problem statement specifies that the team must have exactly n participants. Make sure that your code is correctly calculating the number of participants in each team.
3. **Floating-point errors**. The problem statement specifies that the output must have an absolute or relative error of 10-6. Make sure that your code is using the correct floating-point arithmetic to ensure that the output is accurate.
4. **Memory leaks**. The problem statement does not specify a time limit, so it is important to make sure that your code is not leaking memory.
5. **Incorrect output format**. The problem statement specifies that the output must be a single real number. Make sure that your code is correctly formatting the output.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use a good test suite to thoroughly test your code.
* Use a debugger to help you find and fix errors.
* Use the documentation for the programming language and libraries that you are using.
* Ask for help from other programmers if you are stuck.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input should be a string of exactly 6 characters from the set {R, O, Y, G, B, V}. If the input is not in the correct format, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output should be an integer. If the output is not an integer, the program will crash.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the number of ways to decorate the box**

The number of ways to decorate the box is equal to the number of permutations of the 6 colors. If the program incorrectly calculates this number, the output will be incorrect.

**4. Incorrect rotation of the box**

The program should rotate the box in such a way that the order of the colors on the faces of the box is preserved. If the program incorrectly rotates the box, the output will be incorrect.

**5. Other bugs**

There may be other bugs in the program, such as memory leaks, race conditions, etc. These bugs can cause the program to crash or behave incorrectly.

HACKEREARTH benny-and-the-universe

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The input lists the number of spacecrafts and queries as integers, but the code expects them as strings. This can be fixed by changing the `input()` function to `int(input())`.
2. **Incorrect list comprehension.** The code uses a list comprehension to create a list of all possible combinations of spacecrafts, but the list comprehension is not correctly formed. This can be fixed by adding parentheses around the list comprehension.
3. **Incorrect comparison operator.** The code uses the `==` operator to compare the query to the maximum possible planet ID, but this operator will return `True` even if the query is greater than the maximum possible planet ID. This can be fixed by using the `>` operator.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The code checks if the query is less than the maximum possible planet ID, but it does not check if the query is greater than or equal to the minimum possible planet ID. This can be fixed by adding an additional check to ensure that the query is greater than or equal to 0.
5. **Incorrect output.** The code prints the string `"YES"` if the query is possible and the string `"NO"` if the query is not possible, but it does not include a newline character after each output. This can be fixed by adding a newline character to the end of each output statement.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
N, Q = map(int, input().split())
d = list(map(int, input().split()))
for x in range(Q):
    xi = int(input())
    if xi >= 0 and xi <= sum(d):

HACKEREARTH final-voyage-1

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect sorting of the input data**

The input data is a list of lists. Each list contains the weight and value of an ammunition item. The weights and values are separated by a space. The lists are separated by a newline character.

The code should sort the input data by weight in ascending order. This will make it easier to find the ammunition items with the highest value-to-weight ratio.

**2. Using an incorrect sorting algorithm**

The code should use a sorting algorithm that is efficient for sorting lists of lists. The most efficient sorting algorithm for this problem is merge sort.

**3. Using a suboptimal greedy algorithm**

The code should use a greedy algorithm to find the ammunition items with the highest value-to-weight ratio. The greedy algorithm should choose the ammunition item with the highest value-to-weight ratio that does not exceed the maximum load.

**4. Overflow errors**

The code should be careful to avoid overflow errors. This can be done by using the `long` type for the weight and value of the ammunition items.

**5. Incorrect output format**

The code should print the maximum value of the ammunitions that can be saved. The output should be a single integer.

**6. Incorrect test cases**

The code should include test cases that test all of the possible input scenarios. This will help to ensure that the code is correct.

**7. Inefficient code**

The code should be as efficient as possible. This can be done by using a sorting algorithm that is efficient for sorting lists of lists, and by using a greedy algorithm to find the ammunition items with the highest value-to-weight ratio.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. The developer should check the input format and handle incorrect input appropriately.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The developer may make a mistake in the calculation of the Nth number in the series. For example, the developer may forget to take into account the fact that the first X numbers in the series are all equal to Y. The developer should carefully check the calculation and make sure that it is correct.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer may make a mistake in the indexing of the numbers in the series.

ATCODER p02671 AtCoder Grand Contest 044 - Strange Dance

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect base conversion**

When converting the position number from base 10 to base 3, some developers might forget to perform the necessary carry operations. For example, the number 46 in base 10 is 10110 in base 3. When converting this number to base 2, we need to perform a carry operation after the first bit, resulting in the number 11001.

**2. Incorrect handling of salsa songs**

When a salsa song is played, the person in position `i` moves to position `j`, where `j` is the number obtained replacing all digits 1 with 2 and all digits 2 with 1 when reading `i` in base 3. Some developers might forget to perform this replacement correctly. For example, the number 46 in base 10 is 10110 in base 3. When converting this number to base 2, we need to perform a carry operation after the first bit, resulting in the number 11001.

**3. Incorrect handling of rumba songs**

When a rumba song is played, the person in position `i` moves to position `i+1`. Some developers might forget to perform this increment correctly. For example, if the current position is 0, then the person will move to position 1 after a rumba song is played.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output should be a list of numbers, one per line. Some developers might forget to add a newline character after each number, or they might output the numbers in the wrong order.

**5. Incorrect runtime**

The time complexity of the algorithm should be O(N), where `N` is the number of people dancing. Some developers might implement an algorithm with a time complexity of O(N^2).

Title:
ATCODER p02800 Keyence Programming Contest 2020 - Monochromization

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input specifies that H and W are integers between 1 and 10. However, if you accidentally use a data type that can store larger values, such as an integer64, you may get an incorrect answer.

**2. Not handling invalid input correctly**

The input may contain invalid values, such as a negative number or a string that is not all '.'s and '#'s. If you do not handle these cases correctly, your program may crash or produce an incorrect answer.

**3. Using incorrect math**

The problem asks you to find the number of ways to paint the grid, modulo 998,244,353. If you use incorrect math, you may get an incorrect answer.

**4. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved in O(HW) time. However, if you use a less efficient algorithm, your program may run slowly.

**5. Not using the correct data structures**

The problem can be solved using a simple 2D array to store the state of the grid. However, if you use a more complex data structure, your program may run slower.

**6. Not debugging your code**

It is important to debug your code to make sure that it is correct. This can be done by running your code on a variety of test cases, both valid and invalid.

Title:
ATCODER p02936 AtCoder Beginner Contest 138 - Ki

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The tree traversal algorithm should visit each vertex exactly once, and the order in which the vertices are visited should not affect the results.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the increment operation.** The increment operation should add the specified value to the counter of each vertex in the subtree rooted at the specified vertex. It is important to make sure that the increment operation is performed on all of the vertices in the subtree, and that the values are added correctly.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the output.** The output should print the values of the counters on each vertex, in the order in which the vertices were visited during the tree traversal. It is important to make sure that the values are printed correctly, and that there are no spaces between the values.
4. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that the input is formatted correctly, and that all of the values are valid.
5. **Incorrect runtime.** The time complexity of the solution should be O(N + Q), where N is the number of vertices in the tree and Q is the number of operations. It is important to make sure that the solution is efficient, and that it does not take too long to run.

Title:
ATCODER p03073 AtCoder Beginner Contest 124 - Coloring Colorfully

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of tiles that need to be repainted.** The most common mistake is to count the number of tiles that are the same color as their neighbor, instead of the number of tiles that need to be repainted. For example, if the input is `000`, then the correct answer is `1`, because one tile needs to be repainted to make all tiles different colors. However, a common mistake is to count `3`, because there are three tiles that are the same color as their neighbor.
2. **Not considering the case where all tiles are the same color.** If all tiles are the same color, then no tiles need to be repainted. However, some developers forget to check this case and incorrectly output a non-zero answer.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. It is important to choose an algorithm that is appropriate for the problem size.
4. **Making a programming error.** Even the best algorithms can produce incorrect results if there is a programming error. It is important to carefully check your code for errors before submitting it.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* **Be careful when counting the number of tiles that need to be repainted.** Make sure to only count tiles that are the same color as their neighbor.
* **Consider the case where all tiles are the same color.** If all tiles are the same color, then no tiles need to be repainted.
* **Choose an efficient algorithm.** There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. It is important to choose an algorithm that is appropriate for the problem size.
* **Carefully check your code for errors.** Even the best algorithms can produce incorrect results if there is a programming error. It is important to carefully check your code for errors before submitting it.

Title:
ATCODER p03215 Dwango Programming Contest V - Sum AND Subarrays

Pain points:
**1. Not considering the constraints of the problem.** The problem states that `1 <= N <= 1000`, but the following code would not work for `N = 1001`:

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
        ans = max(ans, a[i] & a[j])

print(ans)
```

**2. Using an incorrect data type.** The problem states that `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`, but the following code would not work for `a_i = 10^9`:

print(ans)
```

**3. Not using the bitwise AND operator.** The problem asks for the maximum possible value of the bitwise AND of the beauties of K nonempty contiguous subsequences, but the following code would not work because it uses the addition operator instead of the bitwise AND operator:

```

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    ans = max(ans, a[i])

print(ans)
```

**5. Using an incorrect algorithm.** The following code would not work because it uses a recursive algorithm, which is not efficient for large values of `N`:

        return ans
    if i >= n or j >= n:
        return ans

ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):

Title:
ATCODER p03364 AtCoder Grand Contest 023 - Find Symmetries

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not correctly specified. For example, the input format does not specify the number of rows and columns of the board. This can lead to errors when trying to read the input data.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not correctly specified. For example, the output format does not specify the number of ways to choose integers A and B such that the second board is a good board. This can lead to errors when trying to print the output data.

**3. Incorrect data type**

The data type of the input data is not correctly specified. For example, the input data is specified as a string, but the data type of the input data should be an integer. This can lead to errors when trying to read the input data.

**4. Incorrect logic**

The logic used to solve the problem is incorrect. For example, the logic does not take into account the fact that the second board is a good board when, for every i and j (1 <= i, j <= N), the letter in Square(i,j) and the letter in Square(j,i) are equal. This can lead to incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect implementation**

The implementation of the solution is incorrect. For example, the implementation does not correctly read the input data or print the output data. This can lead to errors when running the program.

**6. Runtime errors**

The program may run into runtime errors. For example, the program may run out of memory or the program may crash. This can be caused by a number of factors, such as incorrect logic, incorrect data type, or incorrect implementation.

**7. Logical errors**

The program may contain logical errors. For example, the program may not correctly solve the problem or the program may produce incorrect results. This can be caused by a number of factors, such as incorrect logic, incorrect data type, or incorrect implementation.

Title:
ATCODER p03522 CODE FESTIVAL 2017 Exhibition (Parallel) - Increment and Swap

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem asks to find the minimum number of operations required to turn A into a non-decreasing sequence. A non-decreasing sequence is a sequence where each element is greater than or equal to the previous element. So, we need to find the minimum number of operations that need to be performed to make the sequence non-decreasing.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution should be implemented in a way that it takes into account all the constraints of the problem. For example, the solution should be able to handle sequences of length 1 and sequences of length 2.
3. **Incorrect testing of the solution.** The solution should be tested on a variety of input data to ensure that it works correctly. The test data should include cases where the sequence is already non-decreasing, cases where the sequence is strictly decreasing, and cases where the sequence has duplicate elements.
4. **Incorrect analysis of the solution.** The solution should be analyzed to determine its time and space complexity. The time complexity should be as small as possible, and the space complexity should be as small as possible.
5. **Incorrect documentation of the solution.** The solution should be documented in a way that makes it easy for other developers to understand how it works. The documentation should include a description of the problem, the solution, and the time and space complexity of the solution.

ATCODER p03687 AtCoder Grand Contest 016 - Shrinking

Pain points:
```
1. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The developer may make a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may forget to check for a corner case, or may use an incorrect formula.
2. **Incorrect input validation.** The developer may not properly validate the input, which could lead to errors such as a segmentation fault or a runtime error. For example, the developer may not check for invalid characters in the input, or may not check for the input being too long or too short.
3. **Incorrect output formatting.** The developer may not properly format the output, which could make it difficult for the user to understand. For example, the developer may not use the correct number of spaces, or may not use the correct characters to represent special characters.
4. **Failure to handle errors gracefully.** The developer may not handle errors gracefully, which could lead to the program crashing or behaving unexpectedly. For example, the developer may not catch exceptions, or may not provide a way for the user to recover from an error.
5. **Inefficient implementation.** The developer may implement the algorithm in an inefficient way, which could lead to the program running slowly. For example, the developer may use a brute-force approach, or may not use data structures that are well-suited for the problem.
6. **Unintentional bugs.** The developer may introduce unintentional bugs into the code, which could lead to unexpected behavior. For example, the developer may use a variable in the wrong way, or may not initialize a variable correctly.

Title:
ATCODER p03840 AtCoder Grand Contest 008 - Tetromino Tiling

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect variable type

The input is given in the format of `a_I a_O a_T a_J a_L a_S a_Z`. However, the code below assumes that the input is a list of integers. This will cause an error when the input contains a non-integer value.

```python
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

To fix this, we can use the `try`-`except` block to catch any errors that occur when converting the input to a list of integers.

```python
try:
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
except ValueError:
    print(0)
```

### 2. Incorrect calculation

The code below calculates the maximum possible value of K by adding the number of each type of tetromino. However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that some tetrominos can be used more than once.

```python
k = a_I + a_O + a_T + a_J + a_L + a_S + a_Z
```

To fix this, we need to keep track of the number of each type of tetromino that has already been used. We can do this by using a dictionary.

```python
tetrominos = {"I": 0, "O": 0, "T": 0, "J": 0, "L": 0, "S": 0, "Z": 0}

for tetromino in a:
    tetrominos[tetromino] += 1

k = 0
for tetromino in tetrominos:
    if tetrominos[tetromino] % 2 == 0:
        k += tetrominos[tetromino] // 2
    else:
        k += (tetrominos[tetromino] - 1) // 2
```

### 3. Incorrect output

The code below prints the maximum possible value of K, but it does not add a newline character to the end of the output. This can cause the output to be displayed on the same line as the input.

```python
print(k)
```

To fix this, we can add a newline character to the end of the output using the `\n` character.

```python
print(k, end="\n")
```

### 4. Missing error handling

The code below does not handle the case where the input is empty. This can cause the program to crash.

```python
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

To fix this, we can add an `if` statement to check if the input is empty. If the input is empty, we can print a message and exit the program.

```python
if not a:
    print(0)
    exit()
```

### 5. Inefficient code

The code below is inefficient because it uses a nested loop to iterate over the tetrominos. This can be improved by using a list comprehension.

```python
for tetromino in a:
    for other_tetromino in a:
        if tetromino != other_tetromino:
            k += 1
```

The following code is more efficient because it uses a list comprehension to iterate over all possible pairs of tetrominos.

```python
k = sum(1 for tetromino in a for other_tetromino in a if tetromino != other_tetromino)
```

Title:
AIZU p01010 Light Source

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correct. For example, if the number of light sources is not an integer, or if the coordinates of the light sources are not integers, or if the intensity of the light is not an integer, an error will occur.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the angle between two lines**. The angle between two lines is not calculated correctly. For example, if the two lines are parallel, the angle between them is calculated to be 0 degrees, but it should be 180 degrees.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the intersection point of two lines**. The intersection point of two lines is not calculated correctly. For example, if the two lines are parallel, the intersection point is calculated to be (0, 0), but it should be undefined.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the area of a circle**. The area of a circle is not calculated correctly. For example, if the radius of the circle is 1, the area of the circle is calculated to be 3.14159, but it should be 1.
5. **Incorrect calculation of the distance between two points**. The distance between two points is not calculated correctly. For example, if the two points are (0, 0) and (1, 1), the distance between them is calculated to be 1.41421, but it should be √2.
6. **Incorrect calculation of the intersection of a line and a circle**. The intersection of a line and a circle is not calculated correctly. For example, if the line is y = x and the circle is x^2 + y^2 = 1, the intersection of the line and the circle is calculated to be (0, 0), but it should be (1/√2, 1/√2).
7. **Incorrect calculation of the area of a sector of a circle**. The area of a sector of a circle is not calculated correctly. For example, if the radius of the circle is 1 and the angle of the sector is 90 degrees, the area of the sector is calculated to be 1/4, but it should be 1/2.
8. **Incorrect calculation of the volume of a cone**. The volume of a cone is not calculated correctly. For example, if the radius of the base of the cone is 1 and the height of the cone is 2, the volume of the cone is calculated to be 1/3, but it should be 1/4.

Title:
AIZU p01142 Karakuri Doll

Pain points:
* **Misunderstanding the problem statement.** The problem statement is quite long and detailed, so it's easy to miss some important details. For example, the problem states that the doll can only be given a finite sequence of commands, but some solutions try to give the doll an infinite sequence of commands.
* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for determining whether the doll can reach the master's whereabouts and return to the kitchen is quite complex, so it's easy to make mistakes. For example, some solutions incorrectly check whether the doll can reach the master's whereabouts by only considering the forward execution of the program, without considering the reverse execution.
* **Incorrect handling of boundary cases.** The problem statement specifies a number of boundary cases, such as the case where the house is empty or the case where the master's whereabouts is not reachable. Some solutions fail to handle these boundary cases correctly.
* **Inefficient algorithm.** The algorithm for determining whether the doll can reach the master's whereabouts and return to the kitchen is quite computationally expensive. Some solutions can be significantly improved by using more efficient algorithms.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that developers may encounter when solving this problem:

* **A bug in the implementation of the algorithm for determining whether the doll can reach the master's whereabouts and return to the kitchen.** For example, a solution might incorrectly check whether the doll can reach the master's whereabouts by only considering the forward execution of the program, without considering the reverse execution. This bug would cause the solution to incorrectly output that the doll can accomplish its mission, even if it is not actually possible.
* **A bug in the handling of boundary cases.** For example, a solution might incorrectly output that the doll can accomplish its mission if the house is empty. This bug would cause the solution to incorrectly output the correct answer, even if the house is not actually empty.
* **An inefficient algorithm.** For example, a solution might use a brute-force algorithm to determine whether the doll can reach the master's whereabouts and return to the kitchen. This algorithm would be very computationally expensive, and would not be able to solve large instances of the problem.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that they understand all of the requirements. They should also carefully implement the algorithm and test it thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. Finally, they should consider using an efficient algorithm to solve the problem.

Title:
AIZU p02034 Round-trip String

Pain points:
1. The input string `N` can be very large, so it is possible to exceed the memory limit. To avoid this, we can use a sliding window to only store the characters that are currently being used.
2. The output string `K_min` can also be very large. To avoid this, we can use a greedy approach to find the shortest possible string that produces `T`.
3. The problem statement does not specify how to handle duplicate characters in the input string. We can either ignore duplicate characters or treat them as different characters.
4. The problem statement does not specify how to handle the case where `N` is odd. We can either assume that `N` is even or handle the odd case separately.
5. The problem statement does not specify how to handle the case where `T` is empty. We can either return 0 or handle the empty case separately.

Here are some possible solutions to these problems:

1. To avoid exceeding the memory limit, we can use a sliding window to only store the characters that are currently being used. The sliding window can be implemented using a queue. We can start the sliding window with the first `K` characters of the input string. As we iterate over the rest of the input string, we can add the next character to the sliding window and remove the oldest character from the sliding window. If the length of the sliding window is greater than `K_min`, then we can update `K_min` to the length of the sliding window.
2. To find the shortest possible string that produces `T`, we can use a greedy approach. We can start with a string of length 1 and iteratively add characters to the string until the string satisfies the following conditions:
    * The length of the string is equal to `K_min`.
    * The string contains all of the characters in `T`.
    * The string does not contain any duplicate characters.
3. To handle duplicate characters in the input string, we can either ignore duplicate characters or treat them as different characters. If we ignore duplicate characters, then we can simply remove all duplicate characters from the input string before finding the shortest possible string that produces `T`. If we treat duplicate characters as different characters, then we can simply add each duplicate character to the string once.
4. To handle the odd case where `N` is odd, we can either assume that `N` is even or handle the odd case separately. If we assume that `N` is even, then we can simply ignore the last character of the input string when finding the shortest possible string that produces `T`. If we handle the odd case separately, then we can simply find the shortest possible string that produces the first `N - 1` characters of the input string and then add the last character of the input string to the string.
5. To handle the empty case where `T` is empty, we can either return 0 or handle the empty case separately. If we return 0, then we are essentially saying that the empty string is the shortest possible string that produces `T`. If we handle the empty case separately, then we can simply return the length of the input string.

Title:
AIZU p02177 iff

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly handling the transition law.** The transition law states that if $A$ implies $B$, then $B$ implies $A$. This means that if we know that $A$ is true, then we can conclude that $B$ is true, and vice versa. It is important to remember this when solving this problem, as it can be easy to make mistakes if you forget about the transition law.
2. **Not considering all possible values of the propositions.** When solving this problem, it is important to consider all possible values of the propositions. For example, if we are given the information that $A$ implies $B$, then we need to consider the possibility that $A$ is true and $B$ is false. This is because the transition law states that if $A$ implies $B$, then $B$ implies $A$, so if $A$ is true, then $B$ must also be true.
3. **Using incorrect data types.** When solving this problem, it is important to use the correct data types for the propositions. For example, if the propositions are represented as strings, then you will need to use the `str` data type. If the propositions are represented as numbers, then you will need to use the `int` or `float` data type.
4. **Not handling errors correctly.** When solving this problem, it is important to handle errors correctly. For example, if you try to divide by zero, you should raise an exception. If you try to access a nonexistent element of a list, you should return `None`.
5. **Not using efficient algorithms.** When solving this problem, it is important to use efficient algorithms. For example, if you need to find all of the elements of a list that satisfy a certain condition, you should use a `list comprehension` rather than a `for` loop.

Title:
AIZU p02320 Knapsack Problem with Limitations

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the dynamic programming algorithm.** The most common mistake is to use the wrong values for the table indices. For example, if you are trying to find the maximum value of items that can fit in a knapsack with capacity W, you should use i to index the items and j to index the weights of the items. However, many people make the mistake of using i to index the weights and j to index the items. This will result in incorrect results.
2. **Using an incorrect data structure.** The dynamic programming algorithm for the knapsack problem with limitations works by building up a table of values. This table stores the maximum value of items that can be fit in a knapsack with a given capacity and a given number of items. The most efficient way to store this table is to use a two-dimensional array. However, some people try to use a one-dimensional array, which will result in significantly slower performance.
3. **Not handling the base cases correctly.** The base cases for the dynamic programming algorithm for the knapsack problem with limitations are when the knapsack is empty or when there are no items to choose from. If you do not handle these cases correctly, your algorithm will not work correctly.
4. **Using incorrect boundary conditions.** The boundary conditions for the dynamic programming algorithm for the knapsack problem with limitations are when the capacity of the knapsack is less than the weight of any of the items. If you do not handle these boundary conditions correctly, your algorithm will not work correctly.
5. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common source of bugs in any programming problem, but they are especially common in the knapsack problem with limitations. This is because the indices of the table need to be incremented and decremented carefully in order to ensure that the correct values are being computed.
6. **Using incorrect data types.** The data types that you use to represent the values of the items and the capacity of the knapsack can have a significant impact on the performance of your algorithm. For example, using integers to represent the values of the items will be much slower than using floating-point numbers.
7. **Not using memoization.** Memoization is a technique that can be used to speed up the dynamic programming algorithm for the knapsack problem with limitations. Memoization works by storing the results of previously computed subproblems in a table. This allows the algorithm to avoid recomputing the same subproblems multiple times.
8. **Not using dynamic programming.** The dynamic programming algorithm for the knapsack problem with limitations is the most efficient way to solve this problem. If you try to solve the problem using a brute-force approach, your algorithm will be very slow.

Title:
AIZU p02465 Set Difference

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one errors**. The most common bug when solving this problem is to forget to add 1 to the index when iterating over the arrays. This can result in elements being missed or duplicated.
2. **Incorrect use of comparison operators**. When comparing elements from the two sets, it is important to use the correct comparison operator. For example, if you are comparing integers, you should use the `<` operator, not the `==` operator.
3. **Incorrect use of array indices**. When accessing elements from an array, it is important to make sure that the index is within the bounds of the array. Otherwise, you will get a `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
4. **Incorrect use of `set` data structures**. The `set` data structure is a useful tool for solving this problem, but it is important to use it correctly. For example, you should not add duplicate elements to a `set`.
5. **Incorrect use of `sort` methods**. The `sort` method can be a helpful tool for solving this problem, but it is important to use it correctly. For example, you should make sure that the `sort` method is compatible with the data type of the elements in the arrays.

By avoiding these common problems, you can increase your chances of solving this problem correctly.
