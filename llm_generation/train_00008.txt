Title:
CODECHEF absnum

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong operator**

The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero. So, for example, the absolute value of 3 is 3, and the absolute value of -3 is also 3. However, if you accidentally use the subtraction operator instead of the absolute value operator, you will get the wrong answer. For example, if you subtract 3 from -3, you will get -6, which is not the absolute value of -3.

**2. Using the wrong function**

There are several different functions that can be used to calculate the absolute value of a number. The most common function is the abs() function. However, there are also other functions that can be used, such as the fabs() function and the math.abs() function. If you use the wrong function, you will get the wrong answer.

**3. Using the wrong type**

The absolute value of a number is always a positive number. So, if you try to calculate the absolute value of a negative number using a type that can only store negative numbers, you will get an error. For example, if you try to calculate the absolute value of -3 using a signed integer, you will get an error.

**4. Not handling negative numbers correctly**

The absolute value of a negative number is the same as the absolute value of its positive counterpart. So, for example, the absolute value of -3 is the same as the absolute value of 3. However, if you don't handle negative numbers correctly, you might accidentally calculate the wrong absolute value.

**5. Not handling floating-point numbers correctly**

Floating-point numbers are not exact. This means that when you calculate the absolute value of a floating-point number, you might get a slightly different answer than the actual absolute value. For example, if you calculate the absolute value of 3.141592653589793, you might get a slightly different answer than 3.141592653589793.

Title:
CODECHEF chefmath

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the Chefonacci sequence.** The Chefonacci sequence is defined as follows:

```
f(0) = 1;
f(1) = 2;
For i > 1: f(i) = f(i - 1) + f(i - 2)
```

A common mistake is to forget to initialize the first two terms of the sequence, or to use the wrong formula for computing subsequent terms.

2. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The answer to the problem can be very large, so it is important to handle overflow correctly. One way to do this is to use a data type that has a large enough range to represent the answer. Another way is to use a modular arithmetic library to perform calculations modulo a large prime number.

3. **Incorrect use of dynamic programming.** The problem can be solved using dynamic programming. A common mistake is to use the wrong recurrence relation or to initialize the dynamic programming table incorrectly.

4. **Incorrect output.** The output must be a single integer, and it must be printed modulo 10^9 + 7. A common mistake is to print the answer as a floating-point number or to print the answer without modulo reduction.

5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem, such as incorrect logic, typos, and runtime errors. It is important to carefully review your code before submitting it to make sure that it is correct.

Title:
CODECHEF nocoding

Pain points:
1. The program requires the user to input the word to be printed. This could be done using the `input()` function in Python.
2. The program then needs to iterate through the word, one character at a time. This can be done using the `for` loop in Python.
3. For each character in the word, the program needs to load the corresponding value into the buffer. This can be done using the `ord()` function in Python.
4. The program then needs to increment the value in the buffer. This can be done using the `+=` operator in Python.
5. Finally, the program needs to print the value from the buffer. This can be done using the `print()` function in Python.

Here is an example of a program that prints the word "hello":

```python
word = input()

for character in word:
    value = ord(character)
    buffer += value
    buffer += 1

print(buffer)
```

This program is simple because the number of instructions is not more than eleven times the length of the word being printed.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1027_C. Minimum Value Rectangle

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is a little bit tricky. It is easy to make a mistake when reading the input and end up with a wrong answer. For example, if you forget to read the number of sticks in the first line, you will get an incorrect answer.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also a little bit tricky. You need to print the lengths of the four sticks in the order that they appear in the input. For example, if the input is `[7, 2, 2, 7]`, the output should be `[2, 7, 7, 2]`.

**3. Not considering all possible cases**

This problem is asking you to find the rectangle with the smallest possible value of `(P^2)/(S)`. However, there may be multiple rectangles with the same value of `(P^2)/(S)`. In this case, you need to print any one of them.

**4. Using incorrect data structures**

The data structures that you use to solve this problem can have a big impact on the performance of your solution. For example, if you use a list to store the sticks, your solution will be much slower than if you use a set.

**5. Using inefficient algorithms**

The algorithm that you use to solve this problem can also have a big impact on the performance of your solution. For example, a brute-force algorithm will be much slower than a more efficient algorithm.
Test inputs:

Title:
CODEFORCES 1046_B. Hyperspace Highways

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the input/output.**

The input/output of this problem is a list of integers. If you use the wrong data type, such as strings, you will get a runtime error.

**2. Not initializing the data structures properly.**

You need to initialize the data structures that you use in your program before you use them. For example, if you are using a hashmap, you need to call the `init()` method before you add any elements to it.

**3. Using the wrong algorithm.**

The correct algorithm for this problem is Dijkstra's algorithm. If you use a different algorithm, you will get the wrong answer.

**4. Making a mistake in your implementation.**

Even if you use the correct algorithm, you can still make a mistake in your implementation. For example, you might forget to update a variable or you might use the wrong formula.

**5. Not handling corner cases.**

The input/output of this problem contains some corner cases. For example, the input might contain a negative number or a number that is too large. You need to make sure that your program handles these corner cases correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1070_A. Find a Number

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain two integers d and s, separated by a space. However, a developer may accidentally input the integers in the wrong order, or may forget to include the space between the two integers. This will cause the program to crash or output incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the sum of digits.** The sum of digits of a number can be calculated by summing the individual digits of the number. However, a developer may accidentally forget to convert the number to a string before summing the digits, or may use the wrong mathematical operator. This will cause the program to output incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the smallest number divisible by d and having the sum of digits equal to s.** The smallest number divisible by d and having the sum of digits equal to s can be calculated by repeatedly multiplying d by the largest power of 10 that is less than or equal to s. However, a developer may accidentally use the wrong mathematical operator, or may forget to take into account the fact that the number must be positive. This will cause the program to output incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect output.** The output should be the smallest number divisible by d and having the sum of digits equal to s. However, a developer may accidentally output the wrong number, or may forget to print the output. This will cause the program to fail to produce the correct output.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully follow the input format and make sure that they are correctly calculating the sum of digits and the smallest number divisible by d and having the sum of digits equal to s. They should also carefully check their output to make sure that it is correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1091_E. New Year and the Acquaintance Estimation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is very specific. Make sure that you parse the input correctly.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. When computing the number of possible solutions, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one or more solutions. Be careful when counting!
3. **Incorrect logic**. The problem statement is very clear about the conditions that need to be met in order for a solution to be valid. Make sure that your code correctly implements these conditions.
4. **Memory errors**. The input data for this problem can be quite large, so it is important to be careful about memory usage. Make sure that your code does not allocate too much memory, or it will crash.
5. **Time errors**. The time limit for this problem is relatively tight, so it is important to optimize your code as much as possible. Use efficient data structures and algorithms, and avoid unnecessary loops.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that you might encounter when solving this problem:

* You might accidentally read the input data into a wrong data structure. For example, you might read the list of friends into a list of integers, or vice versa. This would cause your code to give incorrect results.
* You might forget to check for the boundary conditions. For example, you might assume that the number of people in the network is always greater than or equal to 1, even though the problem statement says that it can be 0. This would cause your code to crash.
* You might incorrectly implement the logic for computing the number of possible solutions. For example, you might forget to take into account the fact that Bob can be friends with himself. This would cause your code to miss some of the possible solutions.
* You might allocate too much memory. For example, you might create a new list of all the possible solutions, even though you only need to keep track of the number of solutions. This would cause your code to crash.
* You might not optimize your code enough. For example, you might use a brute-force algorithm to compute the number of possible solutions, even though there is a more efficient algorithm available. This would cause your code to run too slowly and time out.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1110_C. Meaningless Operations

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of bitwise operators.** The bitwise XOR operator (`^`) and the bitwise AND operator (`&`) are often used incorrectly. For example, the following code will not work as expected:

```
a = 5
b = 3
print(a ^ b)
```

This code will print `8`, which is not the bitwise XOR of `5` and `3`. The correct code would be:

```
a = 5
b = 3
print(a ^ b)
```

2. **Incorrect use of the greatest common divisor function.** The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b` is the largest integer `d` such that `d` divides both `a` and `b`. The following code will not work as expected:

```
a = 5
b = 3
print(gcd(a, b))
```

This code will print `1`, which is not the GCD of `5` and `3`. The correct code would be:

```
a = 5
b = 3
print(math.gcd(a, b))
```

3. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (`%`) returns the remainder of dividing one number by another. For example, the following code will print `2`:

```
a = 5
b = 3
print(a % b)
```

This code will not work as expected if `b` is zero. The correct code would be:

```
a = 5
b = 0
print(a % b)
```

4. **Incorrect use of the range function.** The range function returns a sequence of numbers from `start` to `stop`. For example, the following code will print the numbers from 0 to 9:

```
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

This code will not work as expected if `start` is greater than `stop`. The correct code would be:

```
for i in range(0, 10):
    print(i)
```

5. **Incorrect use of the list comprehension.** A list comprehension is a concise way to create a list. For example, the following code will create a list of the numbers from 0 to 9:

```
numbers = [i for i in range(10)]
```

This code will not work as expected if the expression inside the list comprehension is not a valid expression. The correct code would be:

```
numbers = [i for i in range(0, 10)]
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 113_E. Sleeping

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not always correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a space instead of a comma, the program may crash or output incorrect results.
* **Incorrect calculation of the number of digits that change:** The number of digits that change when the clock switches can be difficult to calculate correctly. For example, if the clock switches from 00:00 to 00:01, two digits change (the hour and minute digits). However, if the clock switches from 00:00 to 24:00, only one digit changes (the hour digit).
* **Incorrect calculation of the total number of switchings:** The total number of switchings can be difficult to calculate correctly. For example, if the clock is set to 00:00 and the user watches it for 24 hours, there will be 24 * 60 = 1440 switchings. However, if the clock is set to 23:59 and the user watches it for 24 hours, there will be 1439 switchings.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not always correctly formatted, which can make it difficult to read and understand. For example, if the output contains a space instead of a newline, it may be difficult to distinguish between multiple lines of output.

**How to avoid these problems:**

* **Use a well-defined input format:** The input format should be clearly defined and documented so that the developer knows exactly how to format the input data.
* **Use a function to calculate the number of digits that change:** A function can be used to calculate the number of digits that change when the clock switches. This function should take into account the current time and the time that the clock is switching to.
* **Use a function to calculate the total number of switchings:** A function can be used to calculate the total number of switchings that will occur during the time period that the user is watching the clock. This function should take into account the start time, the end time, and the number of hours in a day.
* **Use a function to format the output:** A function can be used to format the output data so that it is easy to read and understand. This function should take into account the number of switchings that occurred and the total number of switchings.

CODEFORCES 1180_C. Valeriy and Deque

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correct. For example, the input may not contain two integers n and q, or the integers may not be in the correct range.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correct. For example, the output may not contain two integers A and B, or the integers may not be in the correct range.
* **Incorrect implementation of the deque data structure:** The deque data structure may not be implemented correctly. For example, the deque may not be able to insert or delete elements from both ends, or the deque may not be able to keep track of the order of the elements.
* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm:** The algorithm may not be implemented correctly. For example, the algorithm may not be able to correctly determine which two elements to pull out of the deque for each query.
* **Incorrect time complexity:** The algorithm may have a time complexity that is too high. For example, the algorithm may take O(n^2) time to process all of the queries, where n is the number of elements in the deque.
* **Incorrect space complexity:** The algorithm may have a space complexity that is too high. For example, the algorithm may use O(n) space to store the deque, where n is the number of elements in the deque.

To avoid these problems and bugs, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to carefully implement the deque data structure and the algorithm. Finally, it is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct.

CODEFORCES 1239_C. Queue in the Train

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm.** The greedy algorithm used in the solution may not always find the optimal solution. For example, in the following input, the greedy algorithm will return the incorrect output:

```
n = 4
p = 2
t = [0, 1, 2, 3]
```

The correct output should be `[0, 2, 3, 4]`, but the greedy algorithm will return `[0, 1, 2, 3]`. This is because the greedy algorithm only considers the seats that are currently empty, and does not take into account the seats that will become empty in the future.

2. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The input and output of the problem may contain very large numbers. For example, the input may contain a number that is larger than `2^31 - 1`, which is the maximum value that can be represented by a signed integer in C++. If the solution does not handle overflow correctly, it may produce incorrect results.

3. **Incorrect use of pointers.** The solution may use pointers incorrectly, which can lead to memory errors. For example, the following code may cause a segmentation fault:

```
int *a = new int[n];
delete[] a;
```

The correct way to delete an array is to use the following code:

```
delete[] a;
```

4. **Incorrect use of dynamic memory allocation.** The solution may use dynamic memory allocation incorrectly, which can lead to memory leaks. For example, the following code may cause a memory leak:

```
int *a = new int[n];
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  a[i] = i;
}
delete[] a;
```

The correct way to allocate and free memory is to use the following code:

```
int *a = new int[n];
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  a[i] = i;
}
delete[] a;
```

5. **Incorrect use of the `cin` and `cout` objects.** The solution may use the `cin` and `cout` objects incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect input and output. For example, the following code may not read all of the input:

```
int n;
cin >> n;
```

The correct way to read all of the input is to use the following code:

```
int n;
cin >> n;
```

6. **Incorrect use of the `scanf` and `printf` functions.** The solution may use the `scanf` and `printf` functions incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect input and output. For example, the following code may not read all of the input:

```
int n;
scanf(" %d ", &n);
```

The correct way to read all of the input is to use the following code:

```
int n;
scanf(" %d ", &n);

Title:
CODEFORCES 1280_F. Intergalactic Sliding Puzzle

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, you might accidentally read the first line as a test case instead of the number of test cases, or you might forget to include the space between the number of test cases and the first test case.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format for this problem is also very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, you might forget to print the newline character after each line of output, or you might not print the DONE line at the end of the output.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm for solving this problem is not trivial, and it is easy to make a mistake when implementing it. For example, you might forget to check if the empty space is on the leftmost column, rightmost column, or in the centermost column before moving an organ to it.
4. **Infinite loop**. The algorithm for solving this problem can potentially enter an infinite loop if the input is invalid. For example, if the input contains two organs in the same row, the algorithm will try to move both organs to the empty space, and it will never terminate.
5. **Time limit exceeded**. The algorithm for solving this problem can potentially take a long time to run if the input is large. For example, if the input contains a grid with a large number of organs, the algorithm will need to check every possible combination of moves to find a solution.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to carefully design and implement your algorithm, and to test it thoroughly with a variety of inputs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1300_E. Water Balance

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format for this problem is a bit tricky. The first line contains an integer `n`, which is the number of water tanks. The second line contains `n` integers, which are the initial volumes of water in each tank. However, the integers in the input are not separated by spaces. Instead, they are separated by commas. This can be a bit confusing for developers who are not used to working with this type of input format.

To avoid this problem, you can use the `split()` method to split the input string into a list of integers. For example, the following code would split the input string into a list of integers:

```
input_string = input()
input_list = input_string.split(',')
```

Once you have the input list, you can then iterate over it and process each integer individually.

### 2. Incorrect output format

The output format for this problem is also a bit tricky. The output should be a list of `n` integers, which are the final volumes of water in each tank. However, the integers in the output should be separated by newlines, not commas. This can be a bit confusing for developers who are not used to working with this type of output format.

To avoid this problem, you can use the `print()` function to print each integer on a separate line. For example, the following code would print the output list:

```
for integer in output_list:
    print(integer)
```

### 3. Floating-point errors

The problem statement states that the absolute or relative error of each `a_i` should not exceed `10^-9`. This means that the difference between `a_i` and the corresponding value in the jury's answer should be less than `10^-9`. However, floating-point numbers are not exact, and there is always some rounding error when performing arithmetic operations on them. This can lead to errors in your solution if you are not careful.

To avoid this problem, you can use the `round()` function to round your answers to the nearest `10^-9`. For example, the following code would round the number `1.23456789` to the nearest `10^-9`:

```
rounded_number = round(1.23456789, 9)
```

### 4. Inefficient algorithms

The problem statement states that the input can be up to `10^6` elements long. This means that your algorithm should be able to handle large input sets efficiently. If your algorithm is not efficient, it may time out on the judge server.

To avoid this problem, you can use a divide-and-conquer approach to solve the problem. This approach works by recursively splitting the input set into smaller and smaller sets until each set is small enough to be processed efficiently.

For example, the following algorithm would solve the problem using a divide-and-conquer approach:

```
def solve(input_list):
    # If the input list is empty, return an empty list.

    if len(input_list) == 0:
        return []

    # Otherwise, split the input list into two halves.

    left_list = input_list[:len(input_list) // 2]
    right_list = input_list[len(input_list) // 2:]

    # Solve the problem for each half of the input list.

    left_solution = solve(left_list)
    right_solution = solve(right_list)

    # Merge the two solutions into one.

    return merge(left_solution, right_solution)

def merge(left_solution, right_solution):
    # Create a new list to store the merged solution.

    merged_solution = []

    # Iterate over the left and right solutions, and add the smaller element to the merged solution.

    for left_element, right_element in zip(left_solution, right_solution):
        if left_element < right_element:
            merged_solution.append(left_element)
        else:
            merged_solution.append(right_element)

    # Return the merged solution.

    return merged_solution
```

### 5. Incorrect logic

The problem statement is a bit tricky, and it is easy to make a mistake in your logic. For example, you might accidentally assume that

a = [round(x, 9) for x in a]
```

```

    if n == 0:

    else:
        left = solve(n // 2, a[:n // 2])
        right = solve(n - n // 2, a[n // 2:])
        return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    merged = []
    for i in range(len(left)):
        if left[i] < right[i]:
            merged.append(left[i])

Title:
CODEFORCES 1324_F. Maximum White Subtree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is given as a list of integers. However, if the input data contains a non-integer value, the program will crash. For example, if the input data contains the string "abc", the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect format**

The input data is given in a specific format. If the input data does not follow the correct format, the program will crash. For example, if the input data does not contain the correct number of integers, the program will crash.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When traversing a data structure, it is important to make sure that you do not miss any elements. For example, if you are traversing a list of integers, you need to make sure that you check the last element in the list. If you do not check the last element, you may miss an element and your program will produce incorrect results.

**4. Indexing errors**

When indexing into a data structure, it is important to make sure that you are indexing into the correct range. For example, if you are indexing into a list of integers, you need to make sure that the index is less than the length of the list. If you index into a position that is out of bounds, your program will crash.

**5. Logic errors**

When writing a program, it is important to make sure that the logic is correct. For example, if you are trying to find the maximum value in a list of integers, you need to make sure that you compare all of the elements in the list. If you do not compare all of the elements, you may not find the maximum value.

**6. Undefined behavior**

When writing a program, it is important to make sure that you do not cause undefined behavior. Undefined behavior is behavior that is not specified by the programming language. For example, if you divide a number by zero, the behavior is undefined. If you cause undefined behavior, your program may crash or produce incorrect results.

The input data is a list of integers, but the developer may accidentally use a different data type, such as a string or a float. This will cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect algorithm**

The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. This could be due to a misunderstanding of the problem, or a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm. This will also cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when the developer accidentally miscounts by one. This could be due to a typo, or a mistake in the logic of the program. Off-by-one errors can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**4. Undefined behavior**

Undefined behavior occurs when the program does something that is not specified in the language's specification. This could be due to a mistake in the implementation of the program, or a misunderstanding of the language's specification. Undefined behavior can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**5. Memory errors**

Memory errors occur when the program allocates or frees memory incorrectly. This could be due to a mistake in the implementation of the program, or a misunderstanding of the language's memory management features. Memory errors can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**6. Race conditions**

Race conditions occur when two or more threads of execution try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**7. Deadlocks**

Deadlocks occur when two or more threads of execution are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can cause the program to crash or hang indefinitely.

**8. Security vulnerabilities**

CODEFORCES 1385_F. Removing Leaves

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The most common mistake when solving this problem is to implement the algorithm incorrectly. This can lead to incorrect results or even a runtime error.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the algorithm. It is also helpful to write out the pseudocode for the algorithm before implementing it in code.

**2. Incorrect input format**

Another common mistake is to incorrectly parse the input format. This can lead to the algorithm being given incorrect input, which will result in incorrect results.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to carefully read the input format and make sure that your code is parsing the input correctly.

**3. Incorrect output format**

The final common mistake is to incorrectly format the output. This can make it difficult for the grader to understand your results, and may result in your submission being incorrect.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to carefully read the output format and make sure that your code is formatting the output correctly.

**4. Runtime errors**

Finally, it is also possible to make runtime errors when solving this problem. These errors can be caused by a variety of factors, such as incorrect memory management or incorrect use of data structures.

To avoid these errors, it is important to carefully debug your code and make sure that it is running correctly.

**5. Incorrect time complexity**

The time complexity of your solution is also important. If your solution is too slow, it may not be able to finish running in the time limit.

To avoid this problem, it is important to choose an efficient algorithm for solving the problem. You can also use a technique called dynamic programming to reduce the time complexity of your solution.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The data type of the input values must be correctly specified. For example, if the input values are integers, but the compiler is expecting floating-point numbers, the compiler may not be able to parse the input correctly.

The variables used in the program must be declared correctly. For example, if a variable is declared as an integer, but it is used to store a floating-point number, the compiler may not be able to compile the program correctly.

**4. Incorrect operator usage**

The operators used in the program must be used correctly. For example, if the operator `+` is used to add two integers, but the operands are actually floating-point numbers, the compiler may not be able to compile the program correctly.

**5. Incorrect logic**

The logic of the program must be correct. For example, if the program is supposed to find the minimum value of a set of numbers, but the program actually finds the maximum value, the program will not produce the correct output.

**6. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are common in programming. For example, if a program is supposed to print the first 100 numbers, but the program actually prints the first 99 numbers, the program will produce an incorrect output.

**7. Memory leaks**

Memory leaks occur when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to a decrease in performance and even crashes.

**8. Race conditions**

Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same shared resource at the same time. This can lead to unexpected results or even crashes.

**9. Deadlocks**

Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource that they both need. This can lead to a situation where neither thread can continue and the program eventually crashes.

**10. Security vulnerabilities**

Security vulnerabilities can occur when a program is not properly designed or implemented. This can allow attackers to exploit the program and gain unauthorized access to the system.

CODEFORCES 1428_B. Belted Rooms

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem is about snakes in a circle of rooms connected by conveyor belts. The goal is to find the number of rooms that are returnable, i.e., the snake can leave the room and come back to it later.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution should iterate over all the rooms and check if the snake can leave the room and come back to it later.
3. **Incorrect test cases.** The test cases should test all the possible cases of the problem.
4. **Incorrect evaluation of the solution.** The solution should be evaluated on a set of test cases to ensure that it is correct.
5. **Incorrect documentation of the solution.** The solution should be well-documented so that other developers can understand how it works.

CODEFORCES 1475_B. New Year's Number

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input and output of this problem are integers. If you use the wrong data type, such as strings, you will get a compilation error.

**2. Using incorrect logic**

The problem is asking for a number that can be represented as the sum of a certain number of 2020 and a certain number of 2021. A common mistake is to check if the number is divisible by 2020 or 2021. However, this is not sufficient. For example, 8079 is not divisible by 2020 or 2021, but it cannot be represented as the sum of a certain number of 2020 and a certain number of 2021.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Another common mistake is to make an off-by-one error. For example, you might check if the number is less than or equal to 2020 + 2021, when it should be less than or equal to 2020 * 2 + 2021.

**4. Using an inefficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved in O(log n) time. However, if you use an inefficient algorithm, such as a brute-force search, you will get a TLE (time limit exceeded) error.

**5. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement does not explicitly mention any edge cases. However, there are a few edge cases that you should be aware of. For example, what if the input is 0? What if the input is negative?

**6. Using incorrect variable names**

It is important to use descriptive variable names. This will make your code more readable and easier to debug. For example, instead of using `n`, you could use `number` or `input`.

CODEFORCES 14_E. Camels

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a number less than 3 or greater than 20.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer, which is the number of possible camels with t humps.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of possible camels**. The number of possible camels is calculated incorrectly. For example, the number of possible camels with t humps is not equal to the number of ways to choose t humps from n vertices.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The number of possible camels is calculated incorrectly due to an off-by-one error. For example, the number of possible camels with t humps is calculated as n-t+1 instead of n-t.
5. **Incorrect use of a loop**. The loop is used incorrectly, which results in an incorrect calculation of the number of possible camels. For example, the loop is used to iterate over all possible values of yi, but yi should only be incremented when the current value of yi is less than 4.
6. **Incorrect use of a conditional statement**. The conditional statement is used incorrectly, which results in an incorrect calculation of the number of possible camels. For example, the conditional statement is used to check if yi is less than 4, but yi should only be checked if yi is greater than 1.
7. **Incorrect use of a function**. A function is used incorrectly, which results in an incorrect calculation of the number of possible camels. For example, the function is used to calculate the number of ways to choose t humps from n vertices, but the function does not take into account the fact that no segment of a polyline should be parallel to the Ox-axis.
8. **Incorrect use of a variable**. A variable is used incorrectly, which results in an incorrect calculation of the number of possible camels. For example, the variable n is used to store the number of vertices in the polyline, but n should be used to store the number of possible camels.

Title:
CODEFORCES 246_D. Colorful Graph

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the graph**

The input graph is represented as a list of edges. Each edge is represented as a tuple of two integers, which are the IDs of the vertices that the edge connects. If the graph is large, this can quickly lead to a memory overflow.

To avoid this problem, you can use a more efficient data structure, such as a [hash table](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict) or a [set](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set).

**2. Not considering all of the edges**

When computing the neighboring color diversity of a color, you need to consider all of the edges in the graph. If you only consider a subset of the edges, you may not get the correct answer.

To avoid this problem, you can iterate over all of the edges in the graph.

**3. Using the wrong algorithm**

The naive algorithm for computing the neighboring color diversity of a color takes O(n^2) time. This is not efficient for large graphs.

A more efficient algorithm is to use [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) to find the shortest paths from each vertex to all other vertices. The neighboring color diversity of a color is then the number of different colors that appear on the shortest paths from the vertices of that color to all other vertices.

**4. Not handling duplicate colors correctly**

The input graph may contain duplicate colors. If you do not handle duplicate colors correctly, you may get the wrong answer.

To avoid this problem, you can use a [set](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set) to store the colors in the graph. This will ensure that each color is only stored once.

**5. Not handling disconnected components correctly**

The input graph may be disconnected, meaning that there are two or more vertices that are not connected by any edges. If you do not handle disconnected components correctly, you may get the wrong answer.

To avoid this problem, you can use [Kruskal's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm) to find the minimum spanning tree of the graph. The neighboring color diversity of a color is then the number of different colors that appear on the edges of the minimum spanning tree that are incident to vertices of that color.

**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format specified in the problem statement is not followed. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format specified in the problem statement is not followed. This can lead to the program being marked incorrect, even if the logic is correct.
* **Off-by-one errors:** These errors occur when the developer forgets to account for the first or last element in an array or list. This can lead to incorrect results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 295_B. Greg and Graph

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input graph is represented by a matrix of integers, where each element represents the weight of an edge. However, the problem statement states that the weight of an edge can be up to 105. This means that we need to use a data type that can store integers up to this size. In C++, we can use the `long long` data type for this purpose.

**2. Not initializing the matrix**

Before we can use the matrix, we need to initialize it to all zeros. This can be done using the following code:

```
int adj[N][N];
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
  for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
    adj[i][j] = 0;
  }
}
```

**3. Using the wrong index**

When accessing the elements of the matrix, we need to make sure that we are using the correct indices. In particular, we need to be careful not to access elements outside of the matrix. This can be done by using the following code:

```
if (i < 0 || i >= N || j < 0 || j >= N) {
  return INT_MAX;
}
```

**4. Not updating the matrix**

When we delete a vertex from the graph, we need to update the matrix to reflect the fact that this vertex is no longer in the graph. This can be done by setting all of the edges that are incident to the deleted vertex to zero. This can be done using the following code:

```
for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
  adj[i][j] = 0;
  adj[j][i] = 0;
}
```

**5. Not computing the correct sum**

The sum of the lengths of the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in the graph can be computed using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. This algorithm works by iteratively computing the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices, starting with the shortest paths between each vertex and itself. The algorithm terminates when the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices have been computed. The following code implements the Floyd-Warshall algorithm:

```
for (int k = 0; k < N; k++) {
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
      adj[i][j] = min(adj[i][j], adj[i][k] + adj[k][j]);
    }
  }
}
```

Once the Floyd-Warshall algorithm has been executed, the sum of the lengths of the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices can be computed by summing the elements of the matrix. This can be done using the following code:

```
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
  for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
    sum += adj[i][j];
  }
}

Pain points:
1. **Inconsistent input**. The input may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers that are too large. The developer should check the input for validity and raise an error if it is invalid.
2. **Incorrect solution**. The developer may implement a solution that does not correctly solve the problem. This could be due to a bug in the code, or a misunderstanding of the problem statement. The developer should carefully test their solution to ensure that it is correct.
3. **Time complexity**. The developer should be aware of the time complexity of their solution. A solution that takes too long to run will not be accepted by the judges. The developer should try to optimize their solution to run as quickly as possible.
4. **Memory usage**. The developer should also be aware of the memory usage of their solution. A solution that uses too much memory will not be accepted by the judges. The developer should try to optimize their solution to use as little memory as possible.
5. **User experience**. The developer should consider the user experience when designing their solution. The solution should be easy to use and understand, and it should provide clear and concise output.

By following these tips, developers can avoid common problems and bugs when solving the CODEFORCES 318_E. Balance problem.

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be exactly as specified in the problem statement. For example, if the problem statement says that the input should be two integers, then you should not input one integer or three integers.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format should be exactly as specified in the problem statement. For example, if the problem statement says that the output should be a single integer, then you should not output a string or a list of integers.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. This is a common mistake that occurs when you forget to add or subtract one from a calculation. For example, if you are computing the sum of a list of numbers, you need to make sure to add the first and last elements of the list.
4. **Indexing errors**. This is a common mistake that occurs when you access an element of a list or array using the wrong index. For example, if you are trying to access the third element of a list, you need to use the index 2, not the index 3.
5. **Logic errors**. This is a general term that refers to any mistake in your code that causes it to produce incorrect results. For example, if you are trying to sort a list of numbers, you need to make sure that you are using the correct sorting algorithm.
6. **Runtime errors**. This is a type of error that occurs when your code runs into a problem that prevents it from continuing. For example, if you try to divide a number by zero, your code will throw a runtime error.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is given as a string, but the developer may incorrectly parse it as an integer. This would lead to incorrect results.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the number of years needed to rise from rank a to rank b. For example, if a = 1 and b = 3, the developer may incorrectly calculate the number of years as 2 instead of 3.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may incorrectly implement the logic for calculating the number of years needed to rise from rank a to rank b. For example, the developer may incorrectly assume that the number of years needed is the same as the difference between b and a.
4. **Memory leak**. The developer may incorrectly allocate memory for the data structures used to solve the problem. This could lead to a memory leak, which would eventually cause the program to crash.
5. **Timeout**. The developer may implement the solution in a way that is too slow. This could lead to the program timing out, which would prevent it from producing a correct output.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input data, use the correct data types, and implement the logic correctly. The developer should also use a memory-efficient data structure and ensure that the solution is not too slow.

Title:
CODEFORCES 45_F. Goats and Wolves

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is given as two space-separated integers, but the developer may accidentally read it as a string or a float. This would cause the program to crash or give incorrect results.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may accidentally count the number of trips one less than necessary. This would cause the program to output the wrong answer.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may not correctly account for all of the possible scenarios that could occur. For example, they may not consider the case where the number of goats and wolves is equal.
4. **Memory leak**. The developer may not properly free up memory that is no longer needed. This could cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
5. **Race condition**. The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared resources. This could cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
6. **Security vulnerability**. The developer may not properly protect sensitive data. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.

Title:
CODEFORCES 482_E. ELCA

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. The tree traversal algorithm should visit each vertex exactly once, and the order in which the vertices are visited should not matter.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the expected value.** The expected value of the value written on the lowest common ancestor of two equiprobably selected vertices i and j is equal to the sum of the values of all vertices in the subtree of i, divided by the number of vertices in the subtree of i.
3. **Incorrect handling of queries of type P.** When a query of type P is processed, the direct ancestor of the vertex u must be updated. This can be done by traversing the tree from the root to the vertex u, and updating the direct ancestor of each vertex that is visited.
4. **Incorrect handling of queries of type V.** When a query of type V is processed, the value of the vertex v must be updated. This can be done by traversing the tree from the root to the vertex v, and updating the value of each vertex that is visited.
5. **Incorrect handling of multiple queries.** When multiple queries are processed, the expected value of the value written on the lowest common ancestor of two equiprobably selected vertices i and j must be updated after each query. This can be done by traversing the tree from the root to the vertex i, and updating the expected value of the value written on the lowest common ancestor of i and j for each vertex that is visited.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these common problems:

* Use a well-tested tree traversal algorithm. There are many different tree traversal algorithms available, so you should choose one that is well-known and has been proven to be correct.
* Carefully calculate the expected value. Make sure that you are using the correct formula, and that you are correctly handling all of the special cases.
* Correctly handle queries of type P. Make sure that you are updating the direct ancestor of each vertex that is visited.
* Correctly handle queries of type V. Make sure that you are updating the value of each vertex that is visited.
* Correctly handle multiple queries. Make sure that you are updating the expected value of the value written on the lowest common ancestor of two equiprobably selected vertices i and j after each query.

CODEFORCES 506_E. Mr. Kitayuta's Gift

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly followed. For example, the input string may contain non-lowercase English letters, or the input integer may be negative.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correctly followed. For example, the output may not be a number, or the output may not be modulo 10007.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The number of palindromes that can be obtained may be incorrect. For example, the calculation may not take into account all possible palindromes.
4. **Memory overflow**. The program may run out of memory while calculating the number of palindromes.
5. **Time limit exceeded**. The program may not finish running within the time limit.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to check your code for errors before submitting it.

CODEFORCES 530_A. Quadratic equation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be a line of integers separated by spaces. If the input is not in the correct format, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input integers should be of type `int`. If the input integers are of type `float` or `string`, the program will crash.
3. **Divide by zero error**. The discriminant of the quadratic equation is `b^2 - 4ac`. If `a` is equal to 0, the discriminant will be equal to 0, which will cause a divide by zero error.
4. **Incorrect roots**. The roots of the quadratic equation are given by `-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) / 2a`. If the discriminant is negative, the roots will be complex numbers. The program should only output real roots.
5. **Roundoff error**. The roots of the quadratic equation are calculated using floating-point arithmetic. There is a chance that the calculated roots will not be exactly equal to the true roots. The program should output the roots to within a certain tolerance.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input format and data types. They should also check for divide by zero errors and incorrect roots. Finally, they should use a floating-point library that provides a high degree of accuracy.

CODEFORCES 556_A. Case of the Zeros and Ones

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a string of length greater than 2 * 10^5, or it may contain a string that contains characters other than 0 and 1.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may contain a number that is not an integer, or it may contain a number that is less than 0 or greater than the length of the input string.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not always find the minimum length of the string that can remain after applying the described operations.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. The implementation of the algorithm may contain bugs. For example, the implementation may not handle all possible cases correctly.
5. **Runtime error**. The algorithm may run into a runtime error, such as a stack overflow or a segmentation fault.

CODEFORCES 626_B. Cards

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of cards.** The first step is to count the number of cards in the deck. This can be done by using the `len()` function on the input string.
2. **Not considering all possible combinations of cards.** When exchanging cards, you need to consider all possible combinations of cards that could be exchanged. For example, if you have two red cards and one blue card, you could exchange the two red cards for a green card, or you could exchange the red and blue cards for a green card.
3. **Making incorrect assumptions about the input.** The input string will only contain the characters `'B'`, `'G'`, and `'R'`. If there are any other characters in the string, your code will not work correctly.
4. **Not handling errors correctly.** If there is an error in the input, your code should handle it gracefully. For example, if the input string is empty, your code should print an error message and exit.
5. **Not using efficient algorithms.** There are more efficient ways to solve this problem than the brute force approach. For example, you could use a sorting algorithm to sort the cards by color, and then you could use a greedy algorithm to exchange the cards in the most efficient way possible.
Test inputs:
1. ```

Title:
CODEFORCES 64_I. Sort the Table

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when parsing it. For example, if the column names contain spaces, the program may not be able to correctly parse them.
2. **Incorrect sorting rules.** The sorting rules must be in the form "FIELD_NAME SORT_ORDER", where SORT_ORDER is either "ASC" (ascending order) or "DESC" (descending order). If the sorting rule is incorrect, the program may not be able to sort the table correctly.
3. **Incorrect data type.** The data in the table must be of type "string". If the data type is incorrect, the program may not be able to sort the table correctly.
4. **Incorrect comparison of strings.** The program must use lexicographic comparison to compare strings. If the comparison is incorrect, the program may not be able to sort the table correctly.
5. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when printing the sorted table. For example, if the column names contain spaces, the program may not be able to print the table correctly.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the program with different input data to make sure that it works correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 675_C. Money Transfers

Pain points:
 1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always strictly followed, and it is easy to make a mistake when parsing the input. For example, if the input contains a space between two integers, the program may interpret them as two separate integers instead of one.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. When calculating the minimum number of operations, it is easy to make a mistake and forget to take into account some edge cases. For example, if the sum of all balances is not zero, the program may output an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not always strictly followed, and it is easy to make a mistake when printing the output. For example, if the output contains a newline character at the end, the program may not be able to read it correctly.
4. **Memory leaks**. When allocating memory for large data structures, it is easy to forget to free them after they are no longer needed. This can lead to memory leaks, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
5. **Synchronization issues**. When multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is important to synchronize their access to avoid conflicts. If synchronization is not done correctly, the program may produce incorrect results or even crash.
6. **Race conditions**. A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. If the data is not protected by a lock, the results of the two threads may be unpredictable.
7. **Deadlocks**. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can cause the threads to be stuck in an infinite loop, and the program may never terminate.
8. **Buffer overflows**. When a buffer is not large enough to hold the data that is being written to it, the data may overwrite adjacent memory locations. This can lead to security vulnerabilities or even crashes.
9. **Format string vulnerabilities**. When a format string is not properly escaped, it can be used to execute arbitrary code on the system. This can lead to serious security vulnerabilities.
10. **SQL injection attacks**. When user input is not properly sanitized, it can be used to inject malicious SQL code into a database. This can lead to data breaches or even the destruction of the database.

The input format is not strictly defined. For example, the input could contain a number of vertices that is not an integer, or the input could contain a sequence of numbers that is not a list of integers. If the input format is not correct, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not strictly defined. For example, the output could contain a number of changes that is not an integer, or the output could contain a sequence of numbers that is not a list of integers. If the output format is not correct, the program will crash.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not find the minimum number of changes required to make the sequence valid, or the algorithm may not find a valid sequence after making the minimum number of changes. If the algorithm is incorrect, the program will not produce the correct output.

**4. Incorrect data**

The data used to test the program may be incorrect. For example, the data may contain a sequence of numbers that does not represent a valid tree, or the data may contain a number of vertices that is too large. If the data is incorrect, the program will not produce the correct output.

**5. Runtime errors**

The program may run into runtime errors, such as running out of memory or running into a segmentation fault. If the program encounters a runtime error, it will crash.

**6. Logic errors**

The program may contain logic errors, such as using the wrong variable or making a mistake in the algorithm. If the program contains logic errors, it will not produce the correct output.

**7. User errors**

The user may make errors when running the program. For example, the user may enter the wrong input, or the user may not understand how to use the program. If the user makes an error, the program will not produce the correct output.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input may not be correct, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a float instead of an integer, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the programmer forgets to add or subtract one from a calculation. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a person being able to walk more than their maximum stamina.
4. **Indexing errors**. Indexing errors occur when the programmer accesses an element of an array or list out of bounds. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a person being assigned a seat that does not exist.
5. **Logic errors**. Logic errors occur when the programmer makes a mistake in the logic of the program. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a person being able to walk to a seat that is not adjacent to their starting position.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully follow the input format and to use the correct data types. It is also important to check for off-by-one errors and indexing errors. Finally, it is important to carefully check the logic of the program to ensure that it is correct.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be either "YES" or "NO". If the output is anything else, the program will not be able to correctly evaluate it and will output an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program should check if the input string can be a result of Kostya's obfuscation. To do this, it needs to check if the string contains all 26 letters of the English alphabet and if each letter appears at most once. If the program does not check these conditions, it will output an incorrect answer.
4. **Runtime errors**. The program should be able to run within a reasonable amount of time. If the program takes too long to run, it will not be able to complete the competition and will be disqualified.

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake. For example, you might forget to put a space between two numbers, or you might put the wrong number of arguments in a query.
2. **Too many queries**. You are only allowed to make 3 * 105 queries. If you exceed this limit, your program will be terminated and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.
3. **Invalid queries**. You are not allowed to make queries with invalid coordinates. For example, you cannot query a point with a coordinate that is outside the range [-108, 108]. If you make an invalid query, your program will be terminated and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.
4. **Not printing the answer**. Once you have found the coordinates of all the lines, you need to print three lines of output. If you do not print the answer, or if you print it in the wrong format, you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.
5. **Not flushing the output**. After printing a query or the answer, you need to flush the output. This is necessary to make sure that your program's output is actually sent to the judge. If you forget to flush the output, you will receive an Idleness Limit Exceeded verdict.
6. **Not exiting when you receive -1**. If your program receives a -1 as an answer, it should immediately exit. If you do not do this, you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

1. Make sure you understand the input format and the output format.
2. Test your program thoroughly before submitting it.
3. Be careful not to make any mistakes in your queries.
4. Make sure you flush the output after each query and the answer.
5. Exit your program immediately if you receive a -1 as an answer.
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect input format**

```

```

This input is incorrect because it does not have the correct number of arguments. The correct input should be:

```

where x and y are the coordinates of the point.

2. **Too many queries**

```
for i in range(3100000):
    print("0 0 0")
    input()
```

This program will make too many queries and will be terminated by the judge.

3. **Invalid queries**

```
print("0 109 109")
input()
```

This query is invalid because the coordinates are outside the range [-108, 108].

4. **Not printing the answer**

```
for i in range(10000):
    print("0 0 0")
    input()
```

This program does not print the answer.

5. **Not flushing the output**

```
print("0 0 0")
```

This program does not flush the output.

6. **Not exiting when you receive -1**

```
while True:
    print("0 0 0")
    input()
```

This program will never exit because it does not check for the -1 response.

CODEFORCES 80_A. Panoramix's Prediction

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be two positive integers n and m, separated by a space. If the input is not in the correct format, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input numbers n and m should be integers. If the input is not an integer, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect range**. The input numbers n and m should be in the range 2 ≤ n < m ≤ 50. If the input numbers are not in the correct range, the program will crash.
4. **Incorrect assumption**. The program assumes that n is prime. If n is not prime, the program will give the wrong answer.
5. **Off-by-one error**. The program checks if m is the next prime number after n by checking if m is prime and if m is greater than n. However, this check is not sufficient. For example, if n = 3 and m = 5, the program will incorrectly return YES, even though 5 is not the next prime number after 3.
6. **Incorrect logic**. The program's logic is incorrect. For example, the program might check if m is prime by checking if m is divisible by 2, 3, and 5. However, this check is not sufficient. For example, if m = 11, the program will incorrectly return NO, even though 11 is prime.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully check the input format, data type, range, and assumptions of your program. You should also carefully check your logic to make sure that it is correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 834_D. The Bakery

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data types**. The data types used in the program must be correct. For example, if a variable is declared as an integer, but a string is assigned to it, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be correct. For example, if the program is supposed to find the maximum value of a set of numbers, but it instead finds the minimum value, the program will give an incorrect answer.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the program misses or repeats a calculation by one. For example, if the program is supposed to sum the first 100 numbers, but it only sums the first 99 numbers, the program will give an incorrect answer.
5. **Infinite loops**. Infinite loops occur when the program enters a loop that never terminates. For example, if the program is supposed to print the numbers from 1 to 10, but it instead prints the numbers from 1 to infinity, the program will enter an infinite loop.
6. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when the program allocates memory that it does not free. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
7. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more parts of the program try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program giving incorrect results or crashing.
8. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more parts of the program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish because it is waiting for the other one. This can lead to the program running indefinitely or crashing.
9. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities occur when the program is not secure. This can allow attackers to gain access to the program or the data it is processing.
10. **Performance issues**. Performance issues occur when the program runs slowly or uses too much resources. This can make the program unusable or difficult to use.

2. **Off-by-one errors.** The code below uses the variable `i` to index into the array `a`, but it does not check that `i` is less than the length of the array. This could lead to incorrect results if the input contains more than `n` elements.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The code below does not correctly account for the case where `i` is equal to `j` or `k`. This could lead to incorrect results if the input contains values that satisfy this condition.
4. **Unnecessary complexity.** The code below uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`. This is unnecessary, as the maximum value of `p·ai + q·aj + r·ak` can be found by simply iterating over the array `a` once and keeping track of the maximum value seen so far.

Here is a corrected version of the code that avoids these problems:

```
n, p, q, r = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

max_val = -10**9
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        for k in range(j + 1, n):
            max_val = max(max_val, p * a[i] + q * a[j] + r * a[k])

print(max_val)

CODEFORCES 903_B. The Modcrab

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correct. For example, the input may contain a letter instead of a number.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correct. For example, the output may contain a number instead of a string.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program is incorrect. For example, the program may not find the optimal solution or may find a solution that does not satisfy the constraints.
4. **Memory limit exceeded**. The program may use too much memory. This can happen if the program does not use an efficient data structure or if the program iterates over a large data set multiple times.
5. **Time limit exceeded**. The program may run for too long. This can happen if the program does not use an efficient algorithm or if the program does not terminate.
6. **Compilation error**. The program may not compile. This can happen if the program contains syntax errors or if the program uses features that are not supported by the compiler.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format, output format, logic, and efficiency of the program. It is also important to use a compiler that supports the features that the program needs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 925_C. Big Secret

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of bitwise operators.** Bitwise operators are powerful tools, but they can be easy to misuse. For example, the following code will not produce the desired output:

```
b = a ^ b
```

This code will only set the bits in `b` that are set in both `a` and `b`. To perform a bitwise XOR, you need to use the `^` operator.

2. **Incorrect use of loops.** Loops are a powerful tool for iterating over collections of data, but they can be easy to misuse. For example, the following code will not produce the desired output:

```
for i in range(n):
    a[i] = b[i]
```

This code will overwrite the values in `a` with the values in `b`. To iterate over the elements of a list, you need to use the `for` loop.

3. **Incorrect use of conditional statements.** Conditional statements are a powerful tool for controlling the flow of your code, but they can be easy to misuse. For example, the following code will not produce the desired output:

```
if a < b:
    print("a is less than b")
```

This code will only print the message if `a` is less than `b`. To check if two values are equal, you need to use the `==` operator.

4. **Incorrect use of functions.** Functions are a powerful tool for reusing code, but they can be easy to misuse. For example, the following code will not produce the desired output:

```
def f(x):
    return x + 1

a = f(b)
```

This code will not call the `f()` function. To call a function, you need to use the `()` operator.

5. **Incorrect use of variables.** Variables are a powerful tool for storing data, but they can be easy to misuse. For example, the following code will not produce the desired output:

```
a = b
b = c
c = a
```

This code will not swap the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. To swap the values of two variables, you need to use the `temp` variable.

6. **Incorrect use of data structures.** Data structures are a powerful tool for organizing data, but they can be easy to misuse. For example, the following code will not produce the desired output:

```
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a[0]
a[0] = a[1]
a[1] = b
```

This code will not sort the list `a`. To sort a list, you need to use the `sort()` method.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly specified. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or the input may not have the correct number of lines.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correctly specified. For example, the output may contain a number that is not an integer, or the output may not have the correct number of digits.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not always produce the correct output, or the algorithm may be too slow.
4. **Incorrect data**. The data used to test the program may be incorrect. For example, the data may contain duplicate values, or the data may not be consistent.
5. **Incorrect implementation**. The program may be incorrectly implemented. For example, the program may have syntax errors, or the program may not handle all possible cases.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the program thoroughly with a variety of input data.

CODEFORCES 980_C. Posterized

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly calculating the number of groups.** The number of groups is not equal to the maximum group size divided by the number of pixels. For example, if the input is `n = 5`, `k = 2`, the number of groups is 3, not 2.
2. **Incorrectly assigning keys to colors.** The keys must be assigned in a way that produces the lexicographically smallest possible array. For example, if the input is `n = 4`, `k = 3`, the correct keys are `0`, `12`, `3`, `3`, not `0`, `12`, `3`, `4`.
3. **Using an incorrect sorting algorithm.** The sorting algorithm must be stable, meaning that equal elements must retain their original order. For example, the following sorting algorithm is not stable:

```
def sort(array):
  for i in range(len(array) - 1):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(array)):
      if array[i] > array[j]:
        array[i], array[j] = array[j], array[i]
```

This algorithm can swap two equal elements, which will change the order of the elements in the output array.
4. **Using an incorrect comparison function.** The comparison function must compare two elements in a way that produces the lexicographically smallest possible array. For example, the following comparison function is not correct:

```
def compare(a, b):
  if a < b:
    return -1
  elif a > b:
    return 1
  else:
    return 0
```

This comparison function will not correctly compare two equal elements.
5. **Not handling the edge cases correctly.** The edge cases are:

* `n = 0`
* `k = 0`
* `k > n`
* `The input array contains duplicate elements`

These edge cases must be handled correctly in order to produce the correct output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 9_C. Hexadecimal's Numbers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a single integer, but the user may accidentally enter a string or a list of numbers. This can be caught by using the `int()` function to convert the input to an integer.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer, but the user may accidentally print a string or a list of numbers. This can be caught by using the `print()` function with the `end=` parameter to specify the output format.
3. **Off-by-one error.** The user may accidentally count the number of numbers incorrectly. This can be avoided by using a loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to `n` and checking each number to see if it is a binary number.
4. **Arithmetic error.** The user may accidentally make a mistake in their arithmetic calculations. This can be avoided by using the `math` module to perform calculations.
5. **Logic error.** The user may make a mistake in their logic. This can be avoided by carefully debugging their code and checking for errors.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* The user might accidentally enter a string instead of an integer, such as `"10"`. This would cause the `int()` function to raise an error.
* The user might accidentally print a string instead of an integer, such as `"2"`. This would cause the compiler to issue a warning.
* The user might accidentally count the number of numbers incorrectly. For example, they might count the number of numbers from 0 to `n` instead of from 1 to `n`.
* The user might accidentally make a mistake in their arithmetic calculations. For example, they might add `n` to `n` instead of subtracting `n` from `n`.
* The user might make a mistake in their logic. For example, they might check if a number is a binary number by checking if it contains the digits `0` and `1`, instead of checking if it contains only the digits `0` and `1`.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specified in the problem statement is not always followed by the test cases. For example, the test case `6

22` has an extra space between `4` and `5`. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The problem statement specifies that the input should be a string, but some test cases may contain integers. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The program may not be able to correctly find all of the possible combinations of three beverage sizes that add up to X. This can cause the program to return an incorrect answer.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** The program may incorrectly count the number of beverage sizes or the total amount of beverage consumed. This can cause the program to return an incorrect answer.

Title:
HACKEREARTH containers-of-choclates-1

Pain points:
So, the maximum number of soliders that can belong to raikage army is 3 1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line of input should contain an integer `T`. However, the sample input contains `4` on the first line, which is not an integer. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that each case should be printed on a separate line, and that the case number should be followed by the maximum possible number of soldiers in the Raikage Army. However, the sample output contains `Case 1: 4` on the first line, which does not follow the correct format. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect variable names**. The sample code uses the variable names `T`, `N`, `A`, and `B`. However, these variable names are not descriptive and could be confusing to other developers. It would be better to use more descriptive variable names, such as `num_cases`, `num_fights`, `soldier_a`, and `soldier_b`.
4. **Incorrect use of `set()`**. The sample code uses the `set()` function to store the soldiers in the Raikage Army. However, this is not the correct way to use `set()`. `set()` should only be used to store unique elements, and the soldiers in the Raikage Army are not necessarily unique. It would be better to use a list or a dictionary to store the soldiers in the Raikage Army.
5. **Incorrect use of `max()`**. The sample code uses the `max()` function to find the maximum possible number of soldiers in the Raikage Army. However, this is not the correct way to use `max()`. `max()` should only be used to find the maximum value of a list or a tuple. It would be better to use a different method to find the maximum possible number of soldiers in the Raikage Army.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that your input and output formats are correct. You should also use descriptive variable names and use the correct data structures to store your data. Finally, you should carefully review your code to make sure that it is correct.

Title:
HACKEREARTH find-product

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulo operator**. The modulo operator (%) in Python returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand. For example, 5 % 2 returns 1. However, in this problem, we need to find the product of all the elements in the array modulo 10^9+7. This means that we need to find the remainder of the product of all the elements in the array divided by 10^9+7. To do this, we can use the following code:

```python
product = 1
for i in range(n):
    product = (product * arr[i]) % (10**9+7)
```

2. **Incorrect use of the factorial function**. The factorial function in Python, `math.factorial()`, returns the factorial of a number. For example, `math.factorial(5)` returns 120. However, in this problem, we need to find the product of all the elements in the array modulo 10^9+7. To do this, we can use the following code:

```python
product = 1
for i in range(n):
    product = (product * arr[i]) % (10**9+7)
```

3. **Incorrect use of the `pow()` function**. The `pow()` function in Python, `pow(x, y)`, returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`. For example, `pow(2, 3)` returns 8. However, in this problem, we need to find the product of all the elements in the array modulo 10^9+7. To do this, we can use the following code:

```python
product = 1
for i in range(n):
    product = (product * arr[i]) % (10**9+7)
```

Title:
HACKEREARTH independence-day-main-war

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is given as a string, but the program expects it to be a number. This can be fixed by using the `int()` or `float()` function to convert the string to the correct data type.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The program calculates the center point by averaging the x- and y-coordinates of all the battle ships. However, this is not correct because the center point is not necessarily the same as the average of all the points. The correct way to calculate the center point is to use the following formula:

```
(x_center, y_center) = ((x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n) / n, (y_1 + y_2 + ... + y_n) / n)
```

3. **Incorrect output format**. The program outputs the center point as a string, but the problem statement requires it to be output in the format `(a, b)`. This can be fixed by using the `str()` function to convert the center point to a string.

4. **Incorrect error handling**. The program does not handle errors correctly. For example, if the input data is invalid, the program will crash. The program should handle errors gracefully by printing an error message and exiting.
5. **Inefficient code**. The program is inefficient because it uses a nested loop to calculate the center point. This can be improved by using a single loop.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def main():
    # Get the number of test cases.
    t = int(input())

    # Loop through the test cases.
    for _ in range(t):
        # Get the number of battle ships.
        n = int(input())

        # Create a list to store the x-coordinates of the battle ships.
        x_coordinates = []

        # Create a list to store the y-coordinates of the battle ships.
        y_coordinates = []

        # Loop through the battle ships.
        for _ in range(n):
            # Get the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the battle ship.
            x, y = map(float, input().split())

            # Add the x-coordinate to the list of x-coordinates.
            x_coordinates.append(x)

            # Add the y-coordinate to the list of y-coordinates.
            y_coordinates.append(y)

        # Calculate the center point.
        x_center = sum(x_coordinates) / n
        y_center = sum(y_coordinates) / n

Title:
HACKEREARTH matrix-symmetry

Pain points:
** Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrectly checking for symmetry.** The most common mistake is to check for symmetry by comparing the first row to the last row, the second row to the second-to-last row, and so on. However, this is not sufficient to check for symmetry, as a matrix can be symmetric about a vertical axis even if the first row is not identical to the last row.
2. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to check for symmetry, and not all of them are correct. For example, the following algorithm is incorrect:

```
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    if (matrix[i][j] != matrix[j][i]) {
      return false;
    }
  }
}
return true;
```

This algorithm is incorrect because it only checks for symmetry about a horizontal axis. To check for symmetry about both axes, you need to use a different algorithm.
3. **Using incorrect data types.** When checking for symmetry, it is important to use the correct data types. For example, if you are using a 2D array to represent the matrix, you need to make sure that the elements of the array are of the same data type.
4. **Using incorrect boundary conditions.** When checking for symmetry, it is important to use the correct boundary conditions. For example, if you are checking for symmetry about a horizontal axis, you need to make sure that the first row and the last row are included in the check.
5. **Using incorrect indexing.** When checking for symmetry, it is important to use the correct indexing. For example, if you are checking for symmetry about a vertical axis, you need to make sure that you are indexing the rows and columns correctly.

**Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:**

1. **Test your code thoroughly.** The best way to avoid errors is to test your code thoroughly. This means testing your code with a variety of different inputs and checking for both correct and incorrect results.
2. **Use a correct algorithm.** There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to check for symmetry, and not all of them are correct. Make sure to use an algorithm that is known to be correct.
3. **Use the correct data types.** When checking for symmetry, it is important to use the correct data types. This will help to prevent errors caused by incorrect typecasting.
4. **Use the correct boundary conditions.** When checking for symmetry, it is important to use the correct boundary conditions. This will help to prevent errors caused by incorrect indexing.
5. **Use the correct indexing.** When checking for symmetry, it is important to use the correct indexing. This will help to prevent errors caused by incorrect array accesses.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain a space after the last integer, or it may not contain a newline character at the end of the input. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The input data may be of the wrong data type. For example, the input may contain a string instead of an integer, or it may contain an integer that is too large. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The program may contain incorrect logic. For example, the program may not correctly check for all possible cases, or it may make incorrect assumptions about the input data. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that occurs when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output.

**5. Memory leaks**

Memory leaks occur when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

**6. Race conditions**

Race conditions occur when two or more parts of a program try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output or crash.

**7. Deadlocks**

Deadlocks occur when two or more parts of a program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish until the other one does. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely.

**8. Security vulnerabilities**

Security vulnerabilities can occur when a program does not properly protect its data from unauthorized access. This can allow attackers to steal sensitive data or take control of the program.

**9. Performance problems**

A program can have performance problems if it is not written efficiently. This can cause the program to run slowly or use too much memory.

**10. User experience problems**

A program can have user experience problems if it is not easy to use or understand. This can cause users to become frustrated and give up on the program.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correct. For example, the output may not be the correct length, or it may not contain the correct characters.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the logic may not account for all possible cases, or it may make incorrect assumptions about the input data.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the developer accidentally miscounts by one. For example, the developer may forget to add one to an index when iterating over a list.
5. **Indexing errors**. Indexing errors occur when the developer accesses an element of an array or list using an incorrect index. For example, the developer may try to access an element that is out of bounds.
6. **Null pointer exceptions**. Null pointer exceptions occur when the developer tries to access a null pointer. For example, the developer may try to call a method on a null object.
7. **ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException**. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs when the developer tries to access an element of an array using an invalid index. For example, the developer may try to access an element that is outside the bounds of the array.
8. **ArithmeticException**. ArithmeticException occurs when the developer performs an invalid arithmetic operation. For example, the developer may try to divide by zero.
9. **Type mismatch**. Type mismatch occurs when the developer tries to assign a value of one type to a variable of another type. For example, the developer may try to assign a string value to an integer variable.
10. **ClassCastException**. ClassCastException occurs when the developer tries to cast an object to a class that it does not belong to. For example, the developer may try to cast a string object to an integer object.

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one error.** The problem statement says that on the first day, there is one pair of bunnies. However, the code below initializes `ans` to 0. This means that the answer will be one off for all test cases.

```
ans = 0
```

2. **Incorrect modulo operation.** The problem statement says that the answer should be modulo 10^9+7. However, the code below uses the modulo operator (%) to calculate the answer. This means that the answer will be incorrect for large values of `n`.

```
print(ans % (10**9+7))
```

3. **Incorrect use of the factorial function.** The problem statement says that the number of rabbits and bunnies on the `n`th day is equal to `(n-1)! * 2`. However, the code below uses the factorial function (`math.factorial`) to calculate the number of rabbits and bunnies. This means that the answer will be incorrect for large values of `n`.

```
ans = math.factorial(n-1) * 2
```

4. **Incorrect use of the `pow` function.** The problem statement says that the answer should be modulo 10^9+7. However, the code below uses the `pow` function to calculate the answer. This means that the answer will be incorrect for large values of `n`.

```
ans = pow(2, n, 10**9+7)
```

5. **Incorrect use of the `%` operator.** The problem statement says that the answer should be modulo 10^9+7. However, the code below uses the `%` operator to calculate the answer. This means that the answer will be incorrect for large values of `n`.

```
ans = ans % (10**9+7)
```

6. **Incorrect use of the `print` function.** The problem statement says that the answer should be printed modulo 10^9+7. However, the code below prints the answer without modulo. This means that the answer will be incorrect for large values of `n`.

```
print(ans)
```

Title:
ATCODER p04012 AtCoder Beginner Contest 044 - Beautiful Strings

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect use of `ord()`

The `ord()` function returns the ASCII code of a character. For example, `ord('a')` returns 97. However, if you try to use `ord()` on a string, you will get an error.

```python
>>> ord('abc')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: ord() expected a character, but string of length 3 found
```

To avoid this error, you can use the `join()` method to convert the string to a list of characters, and then use `ord()` on each character.

```python
>>> list('abc')
['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> [ord(c) for c in list('abc')]
[97, 98, 99]
```

### 2. Incorrect use of `set()`

The `set()` function creates a set from an iterable. A set is a collection of unique elements. For example, `set('abc')` returns the set {'a', 'b', 'c'}.

However, if you try to use `set()` on a string, you will get an error.

```python
>>> set('abc')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unhashable type: 'str'
```

To avoid this error, you can use the `list()` function to convert the string to a list, and then use `set()` on the list.

```python
>>> list('abc')
['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> set(list('abc'))
{'a', 'b', 'c'}
```

### 3. Incorrect use of `len()`

The `len()` function returns the length of an object. For example, `len('abc')` returns 3.

However, if you try to use `len()` on a set, you will get an error.

```python
>>> len({'a', 'b', 'c'})
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: len() of set is not supported
```

To avoid this error, you can use the `list()` function to convert the set to a list, and then use `len()` on the list.

```python
>>> list({'a', 'b', 'c'})
['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> len(list({'a', 'b', 'c'}))
3
```

### 4. Incorrect use of `in`

The `in` operator checks if an element is in a sequence. For example, `'a' in 'abc'` returns True.

However, if you try to use `in` on a set, you will get an error.

```python
>>> 'a' in {'b', 'c'}
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'in' requires an iterable argument
```

To avoid this error, you can use the `list()` function to convert the set to a list, and then use `in` on the list.

```python
>>> list({'b', 'c'})
['b', 'c']
>>> 'a' in list({'b', 'c'})
False
```

Title:
AIZU p00608 Indian Puzzle

Pain points:
Yes

Here are the most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input parsing**. The input format is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when parsing it. For example, if you accidentally read a number as a character, or if you miss a character, the program will not work correctly.
* **Incorrect evaluation of expressions**. The expressions in the puzzle must be evaluated according to the order of operations. This means that multiplication and division must be performed before addition and subtraction. It is also important to remember that division by zero is not allowed.
* **Incorrect handling of blank cells**. The blank cells in the puzzle must be filled with numbers and operators. If you try to fill a blank cell with a letter or a symbol, the program will not work correctly.
* **Incorrect handling of errors**. If the program encounters an error, it should print an error message and exit. It should not continue running, as this could lead to incorrect results.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
AIZU p00745 Tighten Up!

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Off-by-one errors.** When computing the length of the tightened string, it is important to make sure that you are counting the correct number of vertices. A common mistake is to forget to include the two holes in the count.
2. **Incorrect calculations.** When computing the length of a line segment, it is important to use the correct formula. A common mistake is to use the Pythagorean theorem, which only applies to right triangles.
3. **Incorrect data types.** When reading in the input data, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct data types for the coordinates of the points. A common mistake is to use floating-point numbers when the input data is given in integers.
4. **Memory errors.** If the input data is large, it is possible to run out of memory while computing the length of the tightened string. A common solution to this problem is to use a dynamic programming approach, which only stores the information that is needed at each step of the computation.
5. **Algorithmic complexity.** The naive algorithm for computing the length of the tightened string has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of vertices in the initial string. This can be improved to O(n log n) using a divide-and-conquer approach.

Title:
AIZU p01902 Unbalanced Old Maid

Pain points:
The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are as follows:

1. **Incorrectly implementing the game rules.** The game rules are complex and it is easy to make mistakes when implementing them. For example, it is important to remember that the person who draws Mr. Sonoda's card (Mr. Minami or Mr. Kosaka) draws the card with the following strategy:
    1. If you have a card with the same integer written on your card and Mr. Sonoda's card, draw the card with the smallest integer written on it.
    2. Otherwise, if Mr. Sonoda has a non-joker card, draw the card with the smallest integer of them.
    3. If not, Mr. Sonoda only has a joker, so pull the joker

2. **Incorrectly handling the case where one player has only a joker and two other players have empty hands.** In this case, the old maid is finished and the person with the joker loses. It is important to remember that the person with the joker loses, even if they were not the last person to draw a card.

3. **Incorrectly calculating the probability that Mr. Sonoda will not lose.** The probability that Mr. Sonoda will not lose is the product of the following probabilities:
    1. The probability that Mr. Kosaka does not draw a card from Mr. Sonoda's hand.
    2. The probability that Mr. Sonoda does not draw a card from Mr. Kosaka's hand.
    3. The probability that Mr. Minami does not draw a card from Mr. Sonoda's hand.

4. **Incorrectly rounding the answer to the specified number of decimal places.** The answer must not have an absolute error greater than 10 ^ {−6}. It is important to use the correct rounding method to ensure that the answer is accurate.

5. **Incorrectly formatting the output.** The output must be a single line containing the probability that Mr. Sonoda will not lose. The answer must not have an absolute error greater than 10 ^ {−6}. It is important to use the correct format to ensure that the output is correct.

3. **Incorrect implementation of the Othello rules.** The program should correctly implement the rules of Othello, including the rules for placing stones, capturing stones, and ending the game.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the number of stones in the area.** The program should correctly calculate the number of stones in the area after each move.
5. **Incorrect output of the results.** The program should correctly output the number of stones in the area after each game.

Title:
AIZU p02183 Perfect

Pain points:
No
 1. The input format is not clear. For example, is the first line of the input "t_1_1", or "2 3", or "##."?
2. The output format is not clear. For example, is the output "Yes" or "yes" or "YES"?
3. The problem statement is not clear. For example, what does it mean to "place tetromino in the desired position"?
4. The constraints are not clear. For example, what does it mean for a row or column to "consist only of .'s"?
5. The example input and output are not clear. For example, what does the first example input mean? What does the first example output mean?
6. The problem is not well-defined. For example, what happens if there is no way to place the blocks on the board?

Here are some possible solutions to these problems:

1. The input format can be defined as follows:

```
t1_h t1_w
t1_1 ... t1_h
t2_h t2_w
t2_1 ... t2_h
t3_h t3_w
t3_1 ... t3_h
t4_h t4_w
t4_1 ... t4_h
n
B1_1 ... B1_10
B2_1 ... B2_10
...
Bn_1 ... Bn_10
```

where t1_h, t1_w, t2_h, t2_w, t3_h, t3_w, t4_h, t4_w, n, and B1_1, ..., Bn_10 are integers.

2. The output format can be defined as follows:

```
Yes
No
```

3. The problem statement can be defined as follows:

Given four tetromino t1, t2, t3, and t4, choose exactly three of them and place them in the desired position to determine if the block can be placed on the entire board.

However, all of the following conditions must be met before placing tetromino.

* Blocks must not overlap.
* Do not rotate a given tetromino.
* For each i (1 \ leq i \ leq 4), do not use tetromino t_i more than once.
* Each block of tetromino must not go out of the board.

4. The constraints can be defined as follows:

* 1 \ leq n \ leq 10 ^ 5
* Each tetromino given does not violate the conditions mentioned above
* There are exactly 28 `#`s on each board

5. The example input and output can be defined as follows:

```

Title:
AIZU p02470 Euler's Phi Function

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Euler's totient function.** The Euler's totient function, also known as Euler's phi function, is a function that counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n. A positive integer a is said to be relatively prime to n if the greatest common divisor of a and n is 1. The Euler's totient function is often denoted by φ(n).

A common mistake that developers make when implementing the Euler's totient function is to use the following formula:

```
φ(n) = n * (1 - 1 / p)
```

where p is the smallest prime factor of n. This formula is incorrect, as it does not account for the fact that some prime factors of n may be repeated. The correct formula for the Euler's totient function is:

```
φ(n) = n * (1 - 1 / p) * (1 - 1 / p2) * ... * (1 - 1 / pk)
```

where p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.

2. **Incorrect handling of negative inputs.** The Euler's totient function is only defined for positive integers. If a developer attempts to calculate the Euler's totient function of a negative integer, they will get an incorrect result.

3. **Incorrect handling of inputs that are not integers.** The Euler's totient function is only defined for integers. If a developer attempts to calculate the Euler's totient function of a non-integer value, they will get an incorrect result.

4. **Incorrect handling of inputs that are too large.** The Euler's totient function can be computationally expensive to calculate, especially for large inputs. If a developer attempts to calculate the Euler's totient function of a very large input, they may run out of memory or time.

5. **Incorrect use of floating-point arithmetic.** The Euler's totient function can sometimes involve calculations with very small numbers. If a developer uses floating-point arithmetic for these calculations, they may get an incorrect result due to rounding errors.

6. **Incorrect use of modular arithmetic.** The Euler's totient function can sometimes involve calculations with very large numbers. If a developer uses modular arithmetic for these calculations, they may get an incorrect result due to overflow errors.
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Euler's totient function.**

```
n = int(input())
print(n * (1 - 1 / n))
```

2. **Incorrect handling of negative inputs.**

```
n = -1
print(euler_totient(n))
```

3. **Incorrect handling of inputs that are not integers.**

```
n = '123'
print(euler_totient(n))
```

4. **Incorrect handling of inputs that are too large.**

```
n = 1000000000000000000
print(euler_totient(n))
```

5. **Incorrect use of floating-point arithmetic.**

```
n = 1e-100
print(euler_totient(n))
```

6. **Incorrect use of modular arithmetic.**

```
n = 10**9 + 7
print(euler_totient(n))
```
