Title:
CODECHEF lecandy

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is not very strict. For example, the input `2 3 1 1` is valid, but it should be `2 3\n1 1`. If the developer does not handle the incorrect input format correctly, the program may crash or output incorrect results.

Title:
CODECHEF subbxor

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of XOR operator.** The XOR operator is often confused with the OR operator, which can lead to incorrect results. Make sure that you are using the correct operator when computing the XOR of a subarray.
2. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator is used to find the remainder of a division operation. When computing the XOR of a subarray, it is important to use the modulo operator to ensure that the result is always less than or equal to K.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When computing the number of subarrays whose XOR is less than K, it is important to be careful not to count subarrays that overlap. This can be avoided by using a sliding window approach, where the subarrays are considered one at a time, starting with the first element of the array.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The input data may contain edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with only one element. Make sure that your code handles these cases correctly.
5. **Memory leaks.** When using dynamic memory allocation, it is important to free any allocated memory that is no longer needed. Failure to do so can lead to memory leaks, which can eventually cause your program to crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 100_C. A+B

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the two integers should be on separate lines, and that they should not have any leading zeros. If the input format is not followed, the program may not be able to correctly process the input and may produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the sum**. The sum of two integers can be calculated using the following formula: `sum = a + b`. However, if the two integers are very large, the sum may overflow the integer data type and produce incorrect results. To avoid this problem, the sum can be calculated using the following algorithm:

```
while (a > 0 || b > 0) {
  // Add the least significant digit of each integer to the sum.
  sum = sum + (a % 10) + (b % 10);
  // Discard the least significant digit of each integer.
  a = a / 10;
  b = b / 10;
}
```

3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the sum should not have any leading zeros. To ensure that the output is in the correct format, the sum can be left-padded with zeros until it has the same number of digits as the larger of the two input integers.

Here are some additional tips that may help you avoid these problems:

* Use a language that has built-in support for integer arithmetic. This will help you avoid the need to write your own code for calculating the sum.
* Use a compiler or interpreter that has a good error-checking mechanism. This will help you catch errors in your code before you run it.
* Test your code with a variety of input values. This will help you ensure that your code is working correctly for all possible inputs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1032_G. Chattering

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect calculation of the number of seconds until all parrots start chattering.**

The number of seconds until all parrots start chattering is equal to the sum of the respect levels of all parrots to the right and to the left of the parrot that starts chattering. For example, if a parrot with respect level 5 starts chattering, then the number of seconds until all parrots start chattering is 5 + 5 = 10.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the respect levels of the parrots to the right and to the left of the parrot that starts chattering.**

The respect levels of the parrots to the right and to the left of the parrot that starts chattering are not always equal. For example, if a parrot with respect level 5 starts chattering, then the respect levels of the parrots to the right and to the left of it are 4 and 6, respectively.

**3. Incorrect use of the modulus operator (%).**

The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. For example, 5 % 3 = 2. This means that 5 divided by 3 gives a remainder of 2.

When calculating the number of seconds until all parrots start chattering, it is important to use the modulus operator correctly. For example, if a parrot with respect level 5 starts chattering, then the number of seconds until all parrots start chattering is 5 % 2 = 1. This is because 5 divided by 2 gives a remainder of 1.

**4. Incorrect use of the range() function.**

The range() function returns a sequence of numbers from a starting number to an ending number, excluding the ending number. For example, range(5) returns the sequence [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].

When iterating over the parrots in a circle, it is important to use the range() function correctly. For example, if there are 8 parrots in a circle, then the following code would iterate over them correctly:

```
for i in range(8):
  # Do something with parrot i
```

**5. Incorrect use of the enumerate() function.**

The enumerate() function returns a tuple of two elements for each item in a sequence. The first element of the tuple is the index of the item in the sequence, and the second element is the item itself. For example, enumerate(["a", "b", "c"]) returns the following sequence of tuples:

```
(0, "a"), (1, "b"), (2, "c")
```

When iterating over the parrots in a circle, it is important to use the enumerate() function correctly. For example, the following code would iterate over the parrots in a circle correctly:

```
for i, parrot in enumerate(parrots):
  # Do something with parrot i
```
Test inputs:

Title:
CODEFORCES 1055_E. Segments on the Line

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading it. For example, you might accidentally read the number of segments as the number of elements in the list, or you might forget to read the last line of input.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**. The algorithm for solving this problem is not very complicated, but it's easy to make a mistake when implementing it. For example, you might forget to update the minimum value when you add a new element to the multiset, or you might not correctly handle the case when there are not enough segments to choose.
3. **Runtime errors**. The algorithm for solving this problem has a time complexity of O(n log n), so it's important to make sure that your code is efficient. For example, you might want to use a data structure that supports fast insertion and deletion, such as a binary search tree.
4. **Memory errors**. The algorithm for solving this problem does not require a lot of memory, but it's still important to be careful about memory usage. For example, you might want to use a data structure that is designed to be memory-efficient, such as a hash table.
5. **Incorrect output**. The output of your program should be the smallest possible k-th order statistic, or -1 if it's impossible to choose segments in a way that the multiset contains at least k elements. Make sure that your program is correctly computing and printing the output.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain a number that is too large, or it may contain a letter instead of a number. The developer should check the input format and handle errors appropriately.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correctly followed. For example, the output may contain a number that is too large, or it may contain a letter instead of a number. The developer should check the output format and handle errors appropriately.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm that does not solve the problem correctly. For example, the algorithm may not find the maximum possible sum of values of reposted pictures, or it may not find a way to repost some pictures to satisfy all the conditions in the problem statement. The developer should carefully design and implement the algorithm to ensure that it solves the problem correctly.
4. **Incorrect data structures**. The developer may use incorrect data structures to store the input data or to perform calculations. For example, the developer may use a data structure that is not able to store the input data efficiently, or the developer may use a data structure that is not able to perform calculations efficiently. The developer should carefully choose the data structures to ensure that they are able to store the input data and perform calculations efficiently.
5. **Incorrect error handling**. The developer may not handle errors correctly. For example, the developer may not handle errors that occur when reading the input data, or the developer may not handle errors that occur when performing calculations. The developer should carefully handle errors to ensure that the program does not crash or produce incorrect output.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully design and implement the program, and should carefully test the program to ensure that it solves the problem correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1098_E. Fedya the Potter

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect sorting**

The input array `a` is sorted, but the output array `c` is not necessarily sorted. If the developer does not sort `c` correctly, the lower median will not be correct.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the lower median**

The lower median is the element at position `⌊(k+1)/2⌋` in a sorted array of length `k`. If the developer calculates the lower median incorrectly, the output will be incorrect.

**3. Overflow**

The input array `a` can contain very large numbers. If the developer does not handle overflow correctly, the program may crash or give incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect use of data structures**

The problem requires the developer to use two data structures: a data structure to find the greatest integer that divides each element of a subarray, and a data structure to find the sum of a subarray. If the developer uses these data structures incorrectly, the program may crash or give incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The algorithm for finding the lower median is not trivial. If the developer implements the algorithm incorrectly, the program may crash or give incorrect results.

**6. Incorrect input handling**

The input format for this problem is not very complicated, but it is still possible for the developer to make mistakes. For example, the developer may not correctly parse the input, or they may not handle invalid input correctly. If the developer makes a mistake in handling the input, the program may crash or give incorrect results.

CODEFORCES 1167_C. News Distribution

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the graph traversal algorithm.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. The graph traversal algorithm is used to find all the users that are reachable from a given user. If the algorithm is implemented incorrectly, it may miss some users or include users that are not reachable from the given user. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect use of the union-find data structure.** The union-find data structure is used to track the connected components of the graph. If the union-find data structure is used incorrectly, it may not be able to correctly identify the connected components of the graph. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect handling of the case where the graph is disconnected.** If the graph is disconnected, then the news will not be able to spread to all of the users in the graph. The developer must handle this case correctly in order to get the correct results.
4. **Incorrect handling of the case where the graph has a cycle.** If the graph has a cycle, then the news will continue to spread around the cycle forever. The developer must handle this case correctly in order to get the correct results.
5. **Incorrect handling of the case where the graph has multiple sources of the news.** If the graph has multiple sources of the news, then the news will spread to all of the users in the graph. The developer must handle this case correctly in order to get the correct results.

By avoiding these common problems, developers can ensure that their solutions to the news distribution problem are correct.

* **Not considering all possible cases.** When you are trying to find the maximum number of duels, you need to consider all possible ways to place the knights on the board. For example, if the board is 3x3, you can't just place all the knights in the corners and call it a day. You need to consider other possible arrangements, such as placing the knights in the middle of the board.
* **Not using the symmetry of the board.** The board is symmetrical, so you can use this symmetry to your advantage. For example, if you have a solution for a 3x3 board, you can also use that solution for a 4x4 board.
* **Using brute force.** Brute force is a simple but inefficient way to solve problems. It involves trying every possible solution and seeing which one gives the best result. This approach can be very time-consuming, especially for large problems.

### 4. Runtime error

Your code may not run correctly due to a runtime error. There are a few common causes of runtime errors.

* **Using uninitialized variables.** When you declare a variable, you need to initialize it with a value. If you don't initialize a variable, it will contain garbage data, which can cause your code to crash.
* **Using incorrect data types.** Make sure that you are using the correct data types for your variables. For example, if you are trying to store an integer in a variable that is declared as a string, you will get a runtime error.
* **Using incorrect operators.** Make sure that you are using the correct operators for your operations. For example, if you are trying to add two strings together, you will get a runtime error.

### 5. Memory leak

Your code may leak memory. Memory leaks occur when you allocate memory for a variable but don't free it when you are done with it. This can cause your program to run out of memory and crash.

### 6. Other bugs

There are a number of other possible bugs that you may encounter when solving this problem. Here are a few examples:

* **Using incorrect logic.** Your code may contain incorrect logic that results in the wrong answer.
* **Using incorrect math.** Your code may contain incorrect math that results in the wrong answer.
* **Using incorrect algorithms.** Your code may use incorrect algorithms that result in the wrong answer.

It is important to carefully check your code for all of these possible bugs before submitting it.

CODEFORCES 1307_E. Cow and Treats

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the cow's movement algorithm.** The cow's movement algorithm should take into account the following factors:
    * The cow's favorite sweetness
    * The cow's hunger value
    * The number of units of grass remaining in the row
    * The position of the cow in the row

If any of these factors are not taken into account, the cow may not be able to find a suitable place to sleep, or it may get stuck in the row and never be able to eat.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of sleeping cows.** The maximum number of sleeping cows is the number of cows that can eat their favorite sweetness and then fall asleep without encountering another sleeping cow or reaching the end of the row. To calculate this number, you need to consider the following factors:
    * The number of cows in the row
    * The number of units of grass in the row
    * The distribution of the grass sweetness values

If any of these factors are not taken into account, the maximum number of sleeping cows may be overestimated or underestimated.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of ways to choose the subset of cows on the left and right side.** The number of ways to choose the subset of cows on the left and right side is the number of ways to choose the left side multiplied by the number of ways to choose the right side. To calculate these numbers, you need to consider the following factors:
    * The number of cows in the row
    * The number of units of grass in the row
    * The distribution of the grass sweetness values

If any of these factors are not taken into account, the number of ways to choose the subset of cows on the left and right side may be overestimated or underestimated.
4. **Incorrect modulo operation.** The modulo operation is used to ensure that the output of the program is a whole number. However, if the modulo operation is not performed correctly, the output may be incorrect.
5. **Incorrect use of the bitwise operators.** The bitwise operators are used to perform bitwise operations on integers. However, if the bitwise operators are not used correctly, the program may not behave as expected.
6. **Incorrect use of the bitmask.** The bitmask is used to represent a set of bits. However, if the bitmask is not used correctly, the program may not behave as expected.
7. **Incorrect use of the dynamic programming algorithm.** The dynamic programming algorithm is used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems. However, if the dynamic programming algorithm is not used correctly, the program may not be able to solve the problem in a timely manner.
8. **Incorrect use of the memoization technique.** The memoization technique is used to store the results of previously computed subproblems. However, if the memoization technique is not used correctly, the program may not be able to solve the problem in a timely manner.
9. **Incorrect use of the divide and conquer algorithm.** The divide and conquer algorithm is used to solve problems by recursively dividing the problem into smaller subproblems. However, if the divide and conquer algorithm is not used correctly, the program may not be able to solve the problem in a timely manner.
10. **Incorrect use of the backtracking algorithm.** The backtracking algorithm is used to solve problems by exploring all possible solutions to the problem. However, if the backtracking algorithm is not used correctly, the program may not be able to find the optimal solution to the problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1330_E. Drazil Likes Heap

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the heap data structure.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. The heap data structure is a binary tree where the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children. This means that the largest value in the heap is always stored at the root node. To implement a heap, you can use a binary tree data structure and store the values of the nodes in an array. The parent node of a node at index i is stored at index (i - 1) / 2, and the left and right child nodes of a node at index i are stored at indices 2 * i + 1 and 2 * i + 2, respectively.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the function f.** The function f is used to remove the largest element from the heap and replace it with the smallest element in the heap. To implement this function, you can first find the largest element in the heap by traversing the tree from the root node to the leaf nodes. Once you have found the largest element, you can remove it from the heap and replace it with the smallest element in the heap.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum sum after reducing the height of the heap.** The minimum sum after reducing the height of the heap is equal to the sum of the smallest 2^h - 2^g elements in the heap. To calculate this sum, you can first sort the elements in the heap in ascending order. Then, you can sum the first 2^h - 2^g elements in the sorted array.
4. **Incorrect output of the function calls.** The function calls should be output in the same order that they are performed. To output the function calls, you can simply print the index of each node that is removed from the heap.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** If there are no elements in the heap, the function f should throw an exception. To handle this exception, you can use the try-catch statement.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1350_E. Orac and Game of Life

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of pointers**

When dealing with multidimensional arrays, it is important to make sure that you are using pointers correctly. In particular, you need to make sure that you are dereferencing the pointers correctly and that you are not accidentally passing pointers to the wrong arguments.

For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
int **a;
int n, m;
scanf(" %d %d ", &n, &m);
a = malloc(n * sizeof(int *));
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    a[i] = malloc(m * sizeof(int));
}
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
        scanf(" %d ", &a[i][j]);
    }
}
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
        printf(" %d ", a[i][j]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

This code would not work correctly because the pointers `a[i]` are not being dereferenced correctly. In the `printf()` statement, the code is trying to print the value of `a[i][j]`, but it is actually printing the address of `a[i][j]`.

To fix this problem, you need to dereference the pointers before using them in the `printf()` statement. You can do this by using the `*` operator. For example, the following code would work correctly:

```
int **a;
int n, m;
scanf(" %d %d ", &n, &m);
a = malloc(n * sizeof(int *));
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    a[i] = malloc(m * sizeof(int));
}
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
        scanf(" %d ", &a[i][j]);
    }
}
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
        printf(" %d ", a[i][j]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

**2. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that can occur when you are working with arrays or other data structures. An off-by-one error occurs when you accidentally access an element of an array that is one index off from the one you intended to access.

For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
int a[10];
int i;
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    a[i] = i;
}
printf(" %d ", a[10]);
```

This code would print the value of `a[9]` instead of the value of `a[10]`. This is because the loop iterates from 0 to 9, but the index of the last element in the array is 9.

To fix this problem, you need to make sure that you are accessing the elements of the array in the correct order. You can do this by using the `<=` operator in the loop condition. For example, the following code would work correctly:

```
int a[10];
int i;
for (i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
    a[i] = i;
}
printf(" %d ", a[10]);
```

**3. Memory leaks**

Memory leaks occur when you allocate memory for a variable but do not free it when you are finished with it. This can cause your program to run out of memory and crash.

For example, the following code would cause a memory leak:

```
int *a;
a = malloc(100 * sizeof(int));
// do something with a
free(a);
```

In this code, the variable `a` is allocated 100 bytes of memory. However, the code does not free the memory when it is finished with it. This means that the memory will be leaked and the program will eventually run out
Test inputs:
```
#include <stdio.h>

    scanf(" %d %d %d ", &n, &m, &t);
    int **a;
    a = malloc(n * sizeof(int *));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        a[i] = malloc(m * sizeof(int));
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            scanf(" %d ", &a[i][j]);
        }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
        int i, j, p;
        scanf(" %d %d %d ", &i, &j, &p);
        int flag = 0;
        for (int k = -1; k <= 1; k++) {
            for (int l = -1; l <= 1; l++) {
                if (i + k >= 0 && i + k < n && j + l >= 0 && j + l < m && a[i + k][j + l] == a[i][j]) {
                    flag = 1;
                }
            }
        }
        if (flag == 0) {
            printf(" 1 ");
        } else {
            printf(" 0 ");
        }

Title:
CODEFORCES 145_E. Lucky Queries

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correctly parsed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number with a comma instead of a space, the program may crash.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The data type of the input values must be correctly specified. For example, if the input contains a string, but the program expects an integer, the program will crash.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The program's logic must be correct. For example, if the program is supposed to find the longest non-decreasing subsequence of a string, but it actually finds the longest increasing subsequence, the output will be incorrect.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that occurs when the programmer forgets to add or subtract one from a variable. For example, if the program is supposed to find the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of a string, but it starts counting from the first character instead of the second, the output will be incorrect.

**5. Memory leaks**

Memory leaks occur when the program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

**6. Race conditions**

Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

**7. Deadlocks**

Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, but neither one can do so. This can lead to the program freezing or crashing.

**8. Security vulnerabilities**

Security vulnerabilities can occur when the program is not properly protected against malicious attacks. For example, if the program allows users to input arbitrary data, a malicious user could input code that could damage the program or steal data.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1486_A. Shifting Stacks

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is specified as follows:

```
First line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). The second line of each test case contains n integers h_i (0 ≤ h_i ≤ 10^9) — starting heights of the stacks.

It's guaranteed that the sum of all n does not exceed 10^4.
```

If the input format is not followed, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce incorrect output.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format for this problem is specified as follows:

```
For each test case output YES if you can make the sequence of heights strictly increasing and NO otherwise.

You may print each letter in any case (for example, YES, Yes, yes, yEs will all be recognized as positive answer).
```

If the output format is not followed, the program will not be able to correctly print the output and will produce incorrect output.

3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve this problem must be correct in order to produce the correct output. A common mistake is to assume that the sequence of heights is already increasing, when in fact it may not be. Another common mistake is to not consider all possible moves that can be made, which can lead to the program missing a solution.

4. **Incorrect data type**. The data types used to store the input and output data must be correct in order for the program to function correctly. A common mistake is to use the wrong data type for the heights of the stacks, which can lead to the program overflowing or underflowing.

5. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that can occur when programming. This type of error occurs when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one, which can lead to incorrect results.

6. **Indexing errors**. Indexing errors occur when a programmer accesses an element of an array or list using the wrong index. This can lead to the program accessing invalid data or overwriting data that it should not be overwriting.

7. **Logic errors**. Logic errors occur when a programmer makes a mistake in the logic of their program. This can lead to the program producing incorrect output or behaving in an unexpected way.

8. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when a programmer allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

9. **Synchronization errors**. Synchronization errors occur when multiple threads or processes attempt to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the data being corrupted or the program crashing.

10. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities occur when a programmer makes a mistake that allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the program or data. This can lead to the attacker being able to steal data, modify data, or even take control of the program.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always followed correctly. For example, the input may contain non-integer values, or the number of roads may be incorrect. The developer should check the input format and handle errors appropriately.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format should be strictly followed. For example, the output should contain two integers separated by a space, or the output should be in a specific order. The developer should check the output format and handle errors appropriately.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm that does not solve the problem correctly. For example, the algorithm may not find the optimal solution, or it may find a solution that is not optimal. The developer should carefully design and implement the algorithm to ensure that it solves the problem correctly.

**4. Runtime errors**

The developer's code may contain runtime errors that cause the program to crash. For example, the code may attempt to access a memory location that does not exist, or it may divide by zero. The developer should carefully debug the code to ensure that it does not contain any runtime errors.

**5. Memory leaks**

The developer's code may cause memory leaks, which can eventually lead to the program running out of memory. For example, the code may allocate memory that is never freed, or it may create objects that are never destroyed. The developer should carefully design the code to avoid memory leaks.

**6. Security vulnerabilities**

The developer's code may contain security vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to exploit the program. For example, the code may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system, or it may allow attackers to access sensitive data. The developer should carefully design the code to avoid security vulnerabilities.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may not be in the correct format. For example, the numbers may be strings instead of integers.
3. **Index out of bounds**. The index of an array or list may be out of bounds. For example, trying to access the element at index 100 in an array of size 100.
4. **Null pointer exception**. A null pointer exception is thrown when a program tries to access a null object. This can happen when a variable is not initialized, or when an object is deleted before it is used.
5. **Arithmetic overflow**. An arithmetic overflow occurs when a calculation results in a number that is too large to be represented by the data type. For example, trying to add two integers that are larger than the maximum value for that data type.
6. **Divide by zero error**. A divide by zero error occurs when a program tries to divide a number by zero. This is undefined behavior and can cause the program to crash.
7. **Stack overflow**. A stack overflow occurs when a program pushes too many items onto the stack. This can happen when a recursive function calls itself too many times, or when a program allocates too much memory on the stack.
8. **Memory leak**. A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory.
9. **Race condition**. A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same shared resource at the same time. This can lead to unpredictable results, or even to the program crashing.
10. **Deadlock**. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, but neither one can do so. This can also lead to the program crashing.

Title:
CODEFORCES 256_C. Furlo and Rublo and Game

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input specifies that the number of piles can be up to 77777, and the size of each pile can be up to 777777777777. This means that we need to use a data type that can store numbers up to this size. In C++, we can use the `long long` data type for this purpose. However, if we accidentally use the `int` data type instead, we may encounter a **overflow error**, which will cause the program to crash.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The correct algorithm for this problem is to first sort the piles in descending order of size. Then, Furlo can make a move by taking all of the coins from the largest pile. Rublo will then be forced to make a move by taking all of the coins from the second-largest pile. This process will continue until Furlo has won the game.

However, if we use the wrong algorithm, we may not be able to find the optimal solution. For example, if we sort the piles in ascending order of size, then Furlo may not be able to make a move that leaves Rublo with no legal moves.

**3. Not handling special cases correctly**

The input may contain special cases, such as a pile with zero coins or a pile with only one coin. We need to make sure that we handle these cases correctly, otherwise the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

**4. Using incorrect variable names**

It is important to use descriptive variable names when writing code. This will make the code easier to read and understand, and it will help to avoid errors. For example, we should use names like `piles` and `coins` instead of `a` and `b`.

**5. Not commenting the code**

It is important to comment the code so that other developers can understand what it does. This will help to avoid errors and make it easier to maintain the code in the future.
Test inputs:
1. **Input that tests for the correct data type**

```
1

This input will cause an overflow error if the program uses the `int` data type to store the number of coins.

2. **Input that tests for the correct algorithm**

```
2
1000000000000 1000000000000

2. **Not handling the case where the play list's total duration exceeds 109.** This could lead to incorrect results, as the program would not be able to correctly calculate the number of songs that have been played.
3. **Not handling the case where there is no song playing at a particular moment.** This could lead to incorrect results, as the program would not be able to correctly identify the song that was playing at that moment.
4. **Not handling the case where the moments are not in chronological order.** This could lead to incorrect results, as the program would not be able to correctly identify the song that was playing at each moment.
5. **Not handling the case where a song is played more than once.** This could lead to incorrect results, as the program would not be able to correctly identify the song that was playing at each moment.
6. **Not handling the case where a song is played for more than one minute.** This could lead to incorrect results, as the program would not be able to correctly identify the song that was playing at each moment.

Title:
CODEFORCES 396_D. On Sum of Number of Inversions in Permutations

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains a permutation of length up to 10^6. This means that the values of the permutation can be up to 10^6, so we need to use a data type that can store such large values. The most common data types in C++ are int, long, and long long. int can store values up to 2^31-1, which is not enough for our problem. long can store values up to 2^63-1, which is still not enough. long long can store values up to 2^64-1, which is enough for our problem. So we should use long long to store the values of the permutation.

**2. Not using the modulus operator**

The output of the problem should be modulo 10^9+7. This means that we need to use the modulus operator (%) to make sure that the output is a multiple of 10^9+7. For example, if the output is 1000000008, we need to print 1.

**3. Not using the dp table**

The problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can create a dp table where dp[i][j] stores the number of inversions in all permutations that lexicographically do not exceed the permutation p[1..i], where p[i] = j. We can then fill the dp table in bottom-up fashion.

**4. Not handling the edge cases**

There are a few edge cases that we need to handle in this problem. For example, if the input permutation is empty, the output should be 0. We also need to handle the case where the input permutation contains duplicate values.

**5. Not using the right algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a variety of algorithms. The most efficient algorithm is the divide and conquer algorithm. This algorithm works by recursively dividing the input permutation into two smaller permutations, and then computing the number of inversions in each of the smaller permutations. The total number of inversions in the input permutation is then the sum of the number of inversions in the two smaller permutations.

CODEFORCES 445_C. DZY Loves Physics

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of Union-Find**

The Union-Find data structure is a fundamental tool for solving problems on graphs. It is used to find connected components in a graph, and to find the path between two vertices in a graph.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing Union-Find is to use the wrong data structure. For example, they might use a hash table to store the parent pointers, when they should be using an array. This can lead to incorrect results, as the hash table will not be able to handle the large number of elements that are typically used in Union-Find.

Another common mistake is to use the wrong algorithm for merging two sets. The most common algorithm is the path compression algorithm, which is very efficient. However, there are other algorithms that can be used, such as the union by rank algorithm. The choice of algorithm will depend on the specific problem that is being solved.

**2. Incorrect implementation of Kruskal's algorithm**

Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree in a weighted graph. A minimum spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a graph that connects all of the vertices and has the minimum possible total weight.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing Kruskal's algorithm is to use the wrong data structure to store the edges of the graph. For example, they might use a hash table to store the edges, when they should be using an array. This can lead to incorrect results, as the hash table will not be able to handle the large number of elements that are typically used in Kruskal's algorithm.

Another common mistake is to use the wrong algorithm for finding the minimum weight edge. The most common algorithm is the priority queue algorithm, which is very efficient. However, there are other algorithms that can be used, such as the sorted array algorithm. The choice of algorithm will depend on the specific problem that is being solved.

**3. Incorrect implementation of Prim's algorithm**

Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree in a weighted graph. A minimum spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a graph that connects all of the vertices and has the minimum possible total weight.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing Prim's algorithm is to use the wrong data structure to store the edges of the graph.

However, there are other algorithms that can be used, such as the sorted array algorithm. The choice of algorithm will depend on the specific problem that is being solved.

**4. Incorrect implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm**

Dijkstra's algorithm is an iterative algorithm for finding the shortest path between two vertices in a weighted graph. A weighted graph is a graph in which each edge is assigned a weight.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing Dijkstra's algorithm is to use the wrong data structure to store the vertices of the graph. For example, they might use a hash table to store the vertices, when they should be using an array. This can lead to incorrect results, as the hash table will not be able to handle the large number of elements that are typically used in Dijkstra's algorithm.

However, there are other algorithms that can be used, such as the sorted array algorithm. The choice of algorithm will depend on the specific problem that is being solved.

**5. Incorrect implementation of Bellman-Ford algorithm**

Bellman-Ford algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. A weighted graph is a graph in which each edge is assigned a weight.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing Bellman-Ford algorithm is to use the wrong data structure to store the vertices of the graph. For example, they might use a hash table to store the vertices, when they should be using an array.

CODEFORCES 467_D. Fedor and Essay

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data is a string of characters, so we need to use a `str` data type to store it. If we use an incorrect data type, such as an integer, we will get a `ValueError` exception.

**2. Using incorrect indexes**

The input data is a string of characters, so we need to use indexes that start at 0. If we use an incorrect index, such as `10`, we will get a `IndexError` exception.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The problem statement says that we need to find the minimum number of letters `R` in an optimal essay. We can do this by iterating over all the words in the essay and counting the number of letters `R` in each word. Then, we can find the minimum number of letters `R` across all the words.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement says that the essay may contain no words. In this case, we need to return `0` for both the minimum number of letters `R` and the minimum length of the essay.

**5. Using inefficient algorithms**

We can find the minimum number of letters `R` in an optimal essay by iterating over all the words in the essay and counting the number of letters `R` in each word. However, this is an inefficient algorithm, as it takes O(n) time, where n is the number of words in the essay. We can improve the efficiency of this algorithm by using a hash table to store the number of letters `R` in each word. This will reduce the time complexity to O(1) per word.

Title:
CODEFORCES 568_A. Primes or Palindromes?

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect calculation of the number of palindromic numbers**

The naive way to calculate the number of palindromic numbers is to iterate over all numbers from 1 to n and check if each number is palindromic. This approach is inefficient because it takes O(n) time to check if a number is palindromic.

A more efficient way to calculate the number of palindromic numbers is to use the following formula:

```
rub(n) = 2 * (n - 1) / 10 ** floor(log10(n))
```

This formula takes O(log n) time to calculate.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the number of primes**

The naive way to calculate the number of primes is to iterate over all numbers from 2 to n and check if each number is prime. This approach is inefficient because it takes O(n) time to check if a number is prime.

A more efficient way to calculate the number of primes is to use the Sieve of Eratosthenes. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple algorithm that can be used to find all primes up to a given number. The algorithm works by iteratively marking all multiples of each prime number as non-prime. The number of primes up to a given number is then equal to the number of non-marked numbers.

**3. Incorrect comparison of the number of primes and palindromic numbers**

The naive way to compare the number of primes and palindromic numbers is to simply compare the two numbers. This approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the number of palindromic numbers is always less than or equal to the number of primes.

A more correct way to compare the number of primes and palindromic numbers is to use the following inequality:

```
π(n) ≤ A * rub(n)
```

This inequality holds for all values of n and A.

**4. Incorrect output**

The output of the program should be the maximum number n such that π(n) ≤ A * rub(n). If no such number exists, the output should be the string "Palindromic tree is better than splay tree".

**5. Other bugs**

There are a number of other potential bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:

* Incorrect handling of invalid input
* Incorrect error handling
* Incorrect memory management

Title:
CODEFORCES 589_d

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Off-by-one errors.** The most common mistake when working with intervals is to forget to add 1 to the endpoints. This can lead to incorrect results, such as counting the same person twice or missing a person entirely.
2. **Inefficient algorithms.** There are many ways to solve this problem, but some algorithms are more efficient than others. For example, a brute-force algorithm that checks every possible pair of people would be very slow for large datasets. A more efficient algorithm would use a data structure such as a union-find set to track the sets of people who are currently on the boulevard.
3. **Incorrect logic.** It is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the constraints before starting to code. A common mistake is to assume that the intervals are non-overlapping, when in fact they may overlap. Another mistake is to forget that people can greet each other at the start or end of their walk.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The output format for this problem is very specific. Make sure to format your output correctly, or your solution will not be accepted.
5. **Runtime errors.** The time limit for this problem is 1 second. If your solution takes longer than this, it will be marked as incorrect. Make sure to optimize your code to run as fast as possible.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Off-by-one error:** A developer might forget to add 1 to the endpoints of the intervals, which would lead to incorrect results. For example, if the intervals are `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]`, then the correct answer is 2, but a developer who forgets to add 1 to the endpoints would count the intersection of these intervals as `[2, 3]`, which has a length of 1.
* **Inefficient algorithm:** A developer might use a brute-force algorithm to solve this problem, which would be very slow for large datasets. A more efficient algorithm would use a data structure such as a union-find set to track the sets of people who are currently on the boulevard.
* **Incorrect logic:** A developer might incorrectly assume that the intervals are non-overlapping, when in fact they may overlap. For example, if the intervals are `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]`, then the intervals overlap at the point `2`. A developer who incorrectly assumes that the intervals are non-overlapping would not count the intersection of these intervals, which would lead to an incorrect answer.
* **Incorrect output format:** A developer might incorrectly format their output, which would lead to their solution being marked as incorrect. For example, the output for this problem should be a sequence of n integers, separated by spaces. A developer who incorrectly formats their output might output a single integer, or a sequence of integers that is not separated by spaces.
* **Runtime errors:** A developer might write code that runs slower than the time limit of 1 second. This could be caused by a number of factors, such as using an inefficient algorithm, using too much memory, or making unnecessary calls to the operating system.

By avoiding these common problems and bugs, you can increase your chances of success when solving this problem.

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when typing it in. For example, if you forget to put a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect variable names**. When you're writing code, it's important to use descriptive variable names so that you can easily understand what your code is doing. For example, instead of using a variable name like `x`, you could use a name like `chair_number` or `time_spent`.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when you forget to increment or decrement a variable by one. For example, if you're trying to iterate through a list of numbers, you might forget to increment the index by one, which would cause you to skip over one of the numbers in the list.
4. **Logic errors**. Logic errors occur when your code is not doing what you intended it to do. For example, you might accidentally write a conditional statement that always evaluates to true, which would cause your code to loop forever.
5. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when your code allocates memory but does not free it up when it's no longer needed. This can eventually lead to your program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can occur when your code is not properly protected from malicious attacks. For example, you might accidentally expose a sensitive data to an attacker by not using proper encryption.
7. **Performance problems**. Performance problems can occur when your code is not written efficiently. For example, you might use a slow algorithm to solve a problem that could be solved more efficiently with a faster algorithm.
8. **Unmaintainable code**. Unmaintainable code is code that is difficult to read, understand, and modify. This can make it difficult to fix bugs or add new features to your code.

To avoid these problems, it's important to carefully review your code before you run it. You should also use a debugger to help you find and fix bugs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 729_A. Interview with Oleg

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the `startswith()` method.** This method returns `True` if the string starts with the specified prefix, and `False` otherwise. However, some developers mistakenly use it to check if the string contains the specified substring. For example, the following code will not work as expected:

```python
if s.startswith('ogo'):
  # This will not work!
  print('***')
```

To correctly check if the string contains the specified substring, you can use the `find()` method. This method returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring in the string, or `-1` if the substring is not found. For example:

```python
if s.find('ogo') != -1:
  # This will work!
  print('***')
```

2. **Incorrect use of the `replace()` method.** The `replace()` method replaces all occurrences of the specified substring with the specified replacement string. However, some developers mistakenly use it to replace only the first occurrence of the substring. For example, the following code will not work as expected:

```python
s = 'ogoogoogo'
s = s.replace('ogo', '***')
print(s)
```

The output of this code will be `ogo***ogo`. To correctly replace all occurrences of the substring, you can use the `re.sub()` function. This function takes a regular expression as the first argument, the replacement string as the second argument, and the string to be searched as the third argument. For example:

```python
import re

s = 'ogoogoogo'
s = re.sub('ogo', '***', s)
print(s)
```

The output of this code will be `*********`.

3. **Incorrect use of the `split()` method.** The `split()` method splits the string into a list of substrings, using the specified separator. However, some developers mistakenly use it to check if the string contains the specified substring. For example, the following code will not work as expected:

```python
s = 'ogoogoogo'
if 'ogo' in s.split():
  # This will not work!
  print('True')
```

To correctly check if the string contains the specified substring, you can use the `find()` method. For example:

```python
s = 'ogoogoogo'
if s.find('ogo') != -1:
  # This will work!
  print('True')
```

4. **Incorrect use of the `len()` function.** The `len()` function returns the length of the string. However, some developers mistakenly use it to check if the string contains the specified substring. For example, the following code will not work as expected:

```python
s = 'ogoogoogo'
if len(s) == 'ogo':
  # This will not work!
  print('True')
```

To correctly check if the string contains the specified substring, you can use the `find()` method. For example:

```python
s = 'ogoogoogo'
if s.find('ogo') != -1:
  # This will work!
  print('True')
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 749_B. Parallelogram is Back

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the input should consist of three lines, each containing a pair of integer coordinates. However, the input may contain an incorrect number of lines, or the lines may not contain the correct number of integers. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the first line should contain an integer k, which is the number of ways to add one new integer point such that the obtained set defines some parallelogram of positive area. The following k lines should each contain a pair of integer coordinates, which are possible coordinates of the fourth point. However, the program may output the wrong number of lines, or the lines may not contain the correct number of integers. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of ways to add one new integer point**. The number of ways to add one new integer point such that the obtained set defines some parallelogram of positive area is equal to the number of ways to choose two of the three given points as opposite vertices of the parallelogram. However, the program may incorrectly calculate this number, which can cause it to produce incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect generation of the possible coordinates of the fourth point**. The possible coordinates of the fourth point are given by the following formula:

```
(x4, y4) = (x1 + x2 - x3, y1 + y2 - y3)
```

where (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3) are the coordinates of the three given points. However, the program may incorrectly generate these coordinates, which can cause it to produce incorrect output.
5. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:

* Memory leaks
* Race conditions
* Incorrect handling of errors
* Incorrect use of APIs
* Inefficient algorithms
* Unclear or incorrect code

It is important to carefully test your code to ensure that it is free of bugs before submitting it to a competition.

CODEFORCES 772_A. Voltage Keepsake

Pain points:
**1. Overflow**

The input data is large, so it is easy to overflow. For example, if `n = 100000` and `p = 100000`, then the maximum time we can use the devices is `100000 / 100000 = 1`. However, if we calculate `100000 / 100000` directly, we will get `2147483647`. This is an integer overflow. To avoid this problem, we can use a floating-point number to store the result.

**2. Sorting**

The input data is not sorted. We need to sort the devices by their power consumption rate. This can be done using the `sort()` function.

**3. Cumulative sum**

We need to calculate the cumulative sum of the power consumption rate of the devices. This can be done using the `cumsum()` function.

**4. Binary search**

We need to find the maximum time we can use the devices before one of them hits 0 units of power. We can do this using binary search.

**5. Floating-point error**

The answer may have floating-point error. We need to make sure that the answer is correct within a certain tolerance.

**6. Timeout**

The problem is large, so it is easy to run out of time. We need to optimize our code to make sure that it runs within the time limit.

Title:
CODEFORCES 797_A. k-Factorization

Pain points:
**1. Using a naive approach to find all factors of n**

A naive approach to find all factors of n is to iterate over all numbers from 2 to n and check if each number is a factor of n. This approach is inefficient because it will iterate over many numbers that are not factors of n.

**2. Using a more efficient algorithm to find all factors of n**

A more efficient algorithm to find all factors of n is to use the following steps:

1. Find the prime factorization of n.
2. For each prime factor p of n, multiply p by itself k times to get a factor of n.
3. Iterate over all the factors of n that you found in step 2 and print them.

This algorithm is more efficient than the naive approach because it only iterates over the prime factors of n, which are much fewer than all the numbers from 2 to n.

**3. Using the wrong data type to store the factors of n**

If you use an integer data type to store the factors of n, you may run into problems when the factors of n are large. For example, if n is 100000, the largest factor of n is 100000, which is too large to be stored in an integer data type.

To avoid this problem, you can use a long data type to store the factors of n.

**4. Not handling the case where n is not divisible by k**

If n is not divisible by k, then there is no way to find k integers such that their product is equal to n. In this case, you should print -1.

**5. Not handling the case where k is greater than the number of factors of n**

If k is greater than the number of factors of n, then there is no way to find k integers such that their product is equal to n. In this case, you should print -1.

Title:
CODEFORCES 817_C. Really Big Numbers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be two integers separated by a space. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of really big numbers**. The number of really big numbers can be calculated using the following formula:

```
number_of_really_big_numbers = n - (n - s) // 9
```

where `n` is the given integer and `s` is the given difference. If the calculation is incorrect, the program will output an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer. If the output format is incorrect, the program will crash.

Here are some tips to avoid these problems:

1. Make sure that the input format is correct.
2. Use the correct formula to calculate the number of really big numbers.
3. Check the output format before submitting the program.

Title:
CODEFORCES 842_C. Ilya And The Tree

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type for storing the tree**

The input contains a lot of numbers, so it is important to use a data type that can store them all. For example, if the input contains numbers up to 2 * 10^5, then you should use `int64` instead of `int`.

**2. Not handling the case when the tree is not connected**

The problem statement says that the tree is rooted at vertex 1. However, the input does not explicitly state that the tree is connected. So, you need to check if the tree is connected before you start solving the problem.

**6. Not handling the case when the tree has a vertex with degree 2**

The problem statement does not say anything about vertices with degree 2 in the tree. So, you need to check if the tree has a vertex with degree 2 before you start solving the problem.

**7. Not handling the case when the tree has a vertex with degree 3**

The problem statement does not say anything about vertices with degree 3 in the tree. So, you need to check if the tree has a vertex with degree 3 before you start solving the problem.

**8. Not handling the case when the tree has a vertex with degree 4**

The problem statement does not say anything about vertices with degree 4 in the tree. So, you need to check if the tree has a vertex with degree 4 before you start solving the problem.

**9. Not handling the case when the tree has a vertex with degree 5**

The problem statement does not say anything about vertices with degree 5 in the tree. So, you need to check if the tree has a vertex with degree 5 before you start solving the problem.

**10. Not handling the case when the tree has a vertex with degree 6**

The problem statement does not say anything about vertices with degree 6 in the tree. So, you need to check if the tree has a vertex with degree 6 before you start solving the problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 888_G. Xor-MST

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data contains a large number of integers, so it is important to use the correct data types to store them. Using an incorrect data type can lead to overflow errors, which will cause the program to crash.

**2. Using incorrect algorithms**

There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. The most efficient algorithm is Kruskal's algorithm, which runs in O(E log V) time. Using an incorrect algorithm can lead to a significant increase in the running time of the program.

**3. Incorrect implementation of the algorithms**

Even if the correct algorithms are used, the program can still crash if the algorithms are implemented incorrectly. It is important to carefully read the algorithm descriptions and to make sure that the implementation is correct.

**4. Using incorrect input/output**

The program must be able to read the input data correctly and output the correct answer. If the input/output is not handled correctly, the program will not produce the correct output.

**5. Insufficient testing**

It is important to test the program thoroughly to make sure that it is working correctly. This includes testing the program with different input data, as well as testing for edge cases. Insufficient testing can lead to bugs that are not caught until the program is deployed in production.

Title:
CODEFORCES 911_E. Stack Sorting

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `k` integers. Make sure that your input is in the correct format.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output for this problem should be a permutation of size `n`. Make sure that your output is in the correct format.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic for this problem is fairly straightforward. You need to first find the smallest integer that is not in the input. Then, you need to insert this integer into the permutation in such a way that the permutation remains stack-sortable. However, there are a few common mistakes that people make when implementing this logic.
    * **Not considering all possible permutations.** When you are inserting the smallest integer into the permutation, you need to consider all possible permutations of the remaining integers. For example, if the input is `[1, 2, 3]` and the smallest integer is `4`, you need to consider both `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `[1, 2, 4, 3]`.
    * **Not using the stack correctly.** The stack is used to keep track of the order in which the integers are inserted into the permutation. You need to make sure that you push and pop the integers from the stack in the correct order.
    * **Not handling special cases correctly.** There are a few special cases that you need to handle correctly when solving this problem. For example, if the input is `[n]`, the output should be `[1, 2, ..., n - 1, n]`.
4. **Runtime errors.** The runtime of your solution should be `O(n)`. Make sure that your solution is not using any inefficient algorithms or data structures.
5. **Memory errors.** Your solution should not use more than `O(n)` memory. Make sure that your solution is not allocating any unnecessary memory.

CODEFORCES 987_C. Three displays

Pain points:
### 1. Input Format Error

The input format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, if the number of displays is 3, the input should be `3`, but the input `3 1 2 3` will be invalid.

### 2. Unexpected Output

The output of the program may not be what the problem is expecting. For example, the problem asks for the minimum total rent cost of three displays with indices i < j < k such that s_i < s_j < s_k, but the program outputs the maximum total rent cost.

### 3. Runtime Error

The program may run out of time or memory when it is executed. For example, if the number of displays is large, the program may take a long time to run.

### 4. Logical Error

The program may not be correct even though it does not have any of the above problems. For example, the program may not find the optimal solution to the problem.

### 5. Undefined Behavior

The program may behave in an unexpected way due to undefined behavior. For example, the program may crash or produce incorrect results if the input is not valid.

HACKEREARTH panda-and-numbers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly identifying pandatic numbers.** A pandatic number is a number which can be expressed in the form A^A, where A is a positive integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361, 400, 441, 484, 529, 576, 625, 676, 729, 784, 841, 900, 961, 1024, 1089, 1156, 1225, 1296, 1369, 1444, 1521, 1600, 1681, 1764, 1849, 1936, 2025, 2116, 2209, 2304, 2401, 2500, 2601, 2704, 2809, 2916, 3025, 3136, 3249, 3364, 3481, 3600, 3721, 3844, 3969, 4096, 4225, 4356, 4489, 4624, 4761, 4900, 5041, 5184, 5329, 5476, 5625, 5776, 5929, 6084, 6241, 6400, 6561, 6724, 6889, 7056, 7225, 7396, 7569, 7744, 7921, 8100, 8281, 8464, 8649, 8836, 9025, 9216, 9409, 9604, 9801, 10000, ...

2. **Incorrectly subtracting squares of digits.** When subtracting squares of digits, it is important to take into account the sign of the number. For example, if the number is negative, then the square of any digit in the number will also be negative. Therefore, when subtracting the square of a digit from a negative number, the result will be a larger negative number.

3. **Not considering all possible digits.** When subtracting squares of digits, it is important to consider all possible digits in the number. For example, if the number is 123, then the possible digits to subtract squares of are 1, 2, and 3. If the number is 456, then the possible digits to subtract squares of are 4, 5, and 6.

4. **Not considering all possible combinations of digits.** When subtracting squares of digits, it is important to consider all possible combinations of digits. For example, if the number is 123, then the possible combinations of digits to subtract squares of are 1^2, 2^2, and 3^2. If the number is 456, then the possible combinations of digits to subtract squares of are 4^2, 5^2, and 6^2.

5. **Not considering all possible orders of digits.** When subtracting squares of digits, it is important to consider all possible orders of digits. For example, if the number is 123, then the possible orders of digits to subtract squares of are 123, 213, 312, and 321. If the number is 456, then the possible orders of digits to subtract squares of are 456, 546, 645, and 654.

6. **Not considering all possible repetitions of digits.** When subtracting squares of digits, it is important to consider all possible repetitions of digits. For example, if the

Title:
HACKEREARTH roses-game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly initializing the visited array.** The visited array should be initialized to all False values. If it is initialized to all True values, then the program will incorrectly conclude that the player can win the game.
2. **Using the wrong index in the visited array.** The visited array is indexed from 0 to N-1, where N is the number of locations in the game. If the program uses the wrong index, then it may incorrectly conclude that the player has already visited a location when they have not.
3. **Not checking if the player has reached the exit.** The player wins the game if they reach the exit from location N-1. The program should check if the player has reached this exit before printing "Win".
4. **Not handling invalid input.** The input may contain invalid values, such as a negative number or a number that is greater than N-1. The program should handle these invalid values gracefully.
5. **Not using a consistent data type.** The input and output data should be of the same data type. For example, if the input is a list of integers, then the output should also be a list of integers.

Title:
HACKEREARTH unique-ranking

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type.** The input data is a list of lists, but the code tries to iterate over it as a list of integers. This will cause an error.
2. **Off-by-one error.** The code iterates over the list of subjects one less time than it should. This will cause the worst performer to be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The code does not correctly handle ties. This will cause the worst performer to be incorrect in some cases.
4. **Unclear code.** The code is not very clear, which makes it difficult to debug. This can lead to errors being made.
5. **Insufficient testing.** The code was not adequately tested, which means that there are likely to be bugs that were not caught. This can lead to incorrect results.

To avoid these problems, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Use the correct data type.** The input data should be a list of lists, and the code should iterate over it as such.
2. **Check for off-by-one errors.** Make sure that the code iterates over the list of subjects the correct number of times.
3. **Handle ties correctly.** The code should correctly handle ties by choosing the student with the smallest ID.
4. **Make the code clear.** Use clear variable names and comments to make the code easy to understand.
5. **Test the code thoroughly.** Test the code with a variety of inputs to ensure that it is working correctly.

Title:
ATCODER p02589 AtCoder Grand Contest 047 - First Second

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type**

The input specifies that the length of each string is at most 10^6. However, if we use an integer data type to store the length of each string, we will only be able to store strings up to length 2147483647. This is not enough for the longest string in the input, which is length 10^6.

To avoid this problem, we can use a long long data type to store the length of each string.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The naive algorithm for solving this problem is to iterate over all pairs of strings and check if Limak can obtain one string from the other. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(N^2), which is too slow for large values of N.

A more efficient algorithm is to use dynamic programming. We can create a table T[i][j] where T[i][j] is the number of pairs (S_i, S_j) where i \neq j and Limak can obtain one string from the other. We can then fill in the table in a bottom-up fashion.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When iterating over the strings, it is important to make sure that we do not iterate over the same string twice. For example, if we have two strings S_1 and S_2, we should not iterate over the pair (S_1, S_2) and the pair (S_2, S_1).

To avoid this problem, we can use a set to store the strings that we have already visited. We can then check if a string is in the set before we iterate over it.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output should be a single integer, which is the number of pairs (S_i, S_j) where i \neq j and Limak can obtain one string from the other.

To avoid this problem, we can make sure that the output is a single integer and that it is the correct value.

Title:
ATCODER p02720 AtCoder Beginner Contest 161 - Lunlun Number

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input is a positive integer, so we need to use an integer data type to store it. If we use a floating-point data type, we may get unexpected results. For example, if we use `float` to store `100000`, the value will be rounded to `100000.0`. This will cause problems when we compare `100000` with other numbers.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the K-th smallest lunlun number. We can use a binary search to find the answer. However, if we use the wrong algorithm, we may get the wrong answer. For example, if we use a linear search, we may not find the answer in time.

**3. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

The problem states that the input is a positive integer. However, if we do not check the boundary conditions, we may get unexpected results. For example, if we input `0`, the program will crash.

**4. Using incorrect data format**

The problem states that the input is a positive integer. However, if we input a string or a floating-point number, the program will not be able to process it correctly. For example, if we input `"100000"`, the program will not be able to convert it to an integer.

**5. Not handling errors correctly**

The program should handle errors correctly. For example, if the input is invalid, the program should print an error message and exit.

**6. Not testing the program thoroughly**

It is important to test the program thoroughly before submitting it. This will help to catch any bugs that may be present. For example, we can test the program with different input values to make sure that it gives the correct output.
Test inputs:
1. 1

Title:
ATCODER p02850 AtCoder Beginner Contest 146 - Coloring Edges on Tree

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data structure**

The input is a list of edges, and the output is a list of colors. A common mistake is to use a list to store the edges, and then try to iterate over the list to find the colors of the edges. This will not work, because the list of edges is not in any particular order.

The correct way to solve this problem is to use a graph data structure. A graph can be represented as a list of vertices, and a list of edges. The vertices are numbered from 1 to N, and the edges are represented as pairs of vertices.

Once you have a graph data structure, you can use it to find the colors of the edges. To do this, you can start at any vertex and do a depth-first search. As you visit each vertex, you can keep track of the colors of the edges that you have seen. When you reach a vertex that you have already visited, you know that you have found a cycle. The color of the edge that you used to reach the vertex is the color of the cycle.

**2. Not using a topological sort**

A topological sort is a way to order the vertices of a graph so that if there is an edge from vertex A to vertex B, then vertex A comes before vertex B in the topological sort. A topological sort can be used to find the minimum number of colors needed to color the edges of a tree.

To find a topological sort, you can start at any vertex and do a depth-first search. As you visit each vertex, you can add it to a queue. When you reach a vertex that you have already visited, you know that you have found a cycle. The cycle must contain at least one edge, so you can remove the edge from the graph.

Once you have removed all of the edges from the graph, the vertices that are left in the queue are in a topological sort. The number of vertices in the topological sort is the minimum number of colors needed to color the edges of the tree.

**3. Using the wrong colors**

The colors that you use to color the edges of a tree must be distinct. This means that you cannot use the same color for two different edges.

To ensure that the colors are distinct, you can use a set to store the colors that you have already used. As you color each edge, you can add the color to the set. If the color is already in the set, then you know that you have already used that color, and you can choose a different color.

**4. Not handling the case where the tree is not connected**

The input does not specify whether the tree is connected. If the tree is not connected, then you cannot color the edges of the tree with a single color. In this case, you can simply print the number of colors that you need to use to color the edges of the tree.

To find the number of colors that you need to use, you can start at any vertex and do a depth-first search. As you visit each vertex, you can add the color of the vertex to a set. The number of colors in the set is the number of colors that you need to use to color the edges of the tree.

ATCODER p03128 AtCoder Beginner Contest 118 - Match Matching

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is given as integers, but the problem statement requires us to find the largest integer that can be formed with exactly N matchsticks. This means that we need to use a data type that can store integers of arbitrary size. The most common data type for storing integers is `int`, but this data type has a maximum value of `2^31-1`, which is not enough to store the largest integer that can be formed with N matchsticks. We can use the `long long` data type to store integers of arbitrary size.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem statement states that the number of matchsticks used to form digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 should be 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6, respectively. This means that we can use the following algorithm to find the largest integer that can be formed with N matchsticks:

1. Sort the digits in descending order of the number of matchsticks they use.
2. For each digit, use as many of them as possible until we reach N matchsticks.

This algorithm will not always find the largest possible integer. For example, if N is 10 and the digits are 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, then the algorithm will find the integer `999999999`, which is not the largest possible integer. The largest possible integer is `99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999`, which is too large to be stored in a `long long` variable.

**3. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

The problem statement states that there exists an integer that can be formed by exactly N matchsticks under the conditions. This means that we need to make sure that our algorithm always returns an integer. If our algorithm does not return an integer, then it is incorrect.

**4. Not handling all possible cases**

The problem statement states that the digits are all different. This means that we need to make sure that our algorithm does not return an integer that contains duplicate digits. If our algorithm does return an integer with duplicate digits, then it is incorrect.

**5. Not being efficient enough**

The problem statement states that the input data is given as integers, but the problem requires us to find the largest integer that can be formed with exactly N matchsticks. This means that we need to find the largest possible integer that is a multiple of the number of matchsticks used to form each digit. This can be done by multiplying the largest possible integer for each digit. However, this algorithm is not very efficient. A more efficient algorithm would be to use a dynamic programming approach.

ATCODER p03271 AtCoder Regular Contest 102 - Revenge of BBuBBBlesort!

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format is specified as follows:

```
N
p_1
:
p_N
```

However, a developer may accidentally omit the first line of input, which specifies the number of elements in the permutation. This would cause the program to crash when it tries to access the first element of the permutation.

To avoid this problem, the developer should make sure to include the first line of input in their code.

### 2. Incorrect output format

The output format is specified as follows:

```
Yes
```

or

```
No
```

However, a developer may accidentally print the output in the wrong format. This could cause the program to fail the test cases.

To avoid this problem, the developer should make sure to print the output in the correct format.

### 3. Incorrect logic

The logic of the program is to reverse the order of any three elements in the permutation that satisfy the condition `p_{i-1}>p_{i}>p_{i+1}`. However, a developer may accidentally reverse the order of the wrong three elements. This would cause the program to fail the test cases.

To avoid this problem, the developer should carefully check the logic of the program to make sure that it is correct.

### 4. Off-by-one errors

A developer may accidentally miscount the number of elements in the permutation, or the number of times the operation is performed. This could cause the program to produce incorrect results.

To avoid this problem, the developer should carefully check the code to make sure that the correct number of elements and operations are being used.

### 5. Memory leaks

The program may allocate memory that it does not free, which could eventually lead to a memory leak. This could cause the program to crash or run out of memory.

To avoid this problem, the developer should make sure to free any memory that is allocated.

### 6. Race conditions

The program may access shared data without proper synchronization, which could lead to a race condition. This could cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.

To avoid this problem, the developer should use appropriate synchronization mechanisms to ensure that shared data is accessed safely.

Title:
ATCODER p03428 AtCoder Grand Contest 021 - Holes

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the probability calculation.** The probability that Snuke falls into the i-th hole is given by

```
p_i = \frac{1}{N} \cdot \frac{r_i^2}{R^2}
```

where $r_i$ is the distance from the origin to the i-th hole. However, some implementations incorrectly calculate the probability as

```
p_i = \frac{1}{N} \cdot \frac{r_i}{R}
```

This results in an incorrect answer.

2. **Incorrect implementation of the rejection sampling algorithm.** The rejection sampling algorithm used to generate points from the interior of a circle of radius R is not implemented correctly. This can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Incorrect input validation.** The input data is not validated correctly. This can lead to incorrect results or a crash.

4. **Incorrect output formatting.** The output is not formatted correctly. This can make it difficult to read and understand the results.

5. **Incorrect error handling.** The code does not handle errors correctly. This can lead to a crash or incorrect results.

6. **Inefficient implementation.** The code is not implemented efficiently. This can lead to slow performance.

7. **Unclear code.** The code is not written clearly. This makes it difficult to understand and debug.

8. **Unmaintainable code.** The code is not maintainable. This makes it difficult to make changes to the code in the future.

9. **Unused code.** There is unused code in the project. This can lead to confusion and make it difficult to maintain the code.

10. **Duplicate code.** There is duplicate code in the project. This can lead to confusion and make it difficult to maintain the code.

Title:
ATCODER p03586 Tenka1 Programmer Contest - ModularPowerEquation!!

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the modulo operation.** The modulo operation is often implemented incorrectly, resulting in incorrect answers. For example, the following code would incorrectly compute the modulo of `a` by `m`:

```
c = a % m
```

This is because the modulo operation is not associative, so the order of operations matters. The correct way to compute the modulo of `a` by `m` is to use the following code:

```
c = a - (a // m) * m
```

2. **Incorrect use of the Chinese remainder theorem.** The Chinese remainder theorem is a powerful tool for solving systems of congruences, but it is important to use it correctly. For example, the following code would incorrectly solve the system of congruences `x ≡ 1 (mod 3)` and `x ≡ 2 (mod 5)`:

```
x = 1 * 5 + 2 * 3
```

This is because the Chinese remainder theorem requires that the moduli be pairwise coprime. In this case, the moduli `3` and `5` are not coprime, so the solution to the system of congruences is not unique.

3. **Incorrect use of the extended Euclidean algorithm.** The extended Euclidean algorithm is a powerful tool for computing the greatest common divisor of two integers, but it is important to use it correctly. For example, the following code would incorrectly compute the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`:

```
gcd = a // b
```

This is because the extended Euclidean algorithm returns the **multiplicative** inverse of `b` modulo `a`, not the **greatest** common divisor of `a` and `b`.

4. **Incorrect use of the binary search algorithm.** The binary search algorithm is a powerful tool for finding the location of an element in a sorted array, but it is important to use it correctly. For example, the following code would incorrectly find the index of the first occurrence of `x` in the array `a`:

```
i = bisect.bisect_left(a, x)
```

This is because the binary search algorithm returns the index of the **last** occurrence of `x` in the array `a`, not the **first** occurrence.

5. **Incorrect use of the Sieve of Eratosthenes.** The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a powerful tool for finding all of the prime numbers up to a given limit, but it is important to use it correctly. For example, the following code would incorrectly find all of the prime numbers up to `n`:

```
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    if is_prime(i):
        print(i)
```

This is because the Sieve of Eratosthenes only finds the **prime** numbers up to `n`, not all of the numbers up to `n`.

Title:
ATCODER p03744 AtCoder Regular Contest 072 - Dam

Pain points:
1. The input format is not clear. It is not clear whether the input should be 1-indexed or 0-indexed. It is also not clear whether the first line should include the number of days or the capacity of the dam.
2. The problem statement does not specify how to handle overflows. For example, if the dam is initially empty and 10 liters of water at 100 degrees Celsius flows into the dam on the first day, then the temperature of the water in the dam will be 100 degrees Celsius. However, if 10 liters of water at 0 degrees Celsius flows into the dam on the second day, then the temperature of the water in the dam will be 50 degrees Celsius. This is because the temperature of the water in the dam is not affected by anything but new water that flows into the dam.
3. The problem statement does not specify how to handle negative temperatures. For example, if the dam is initially empty and 10 liters of water at -100 degrees Celsius flows into the dam on the first day, then the temperature of the water in the dam will be -100 degrees Celsius. However, if 10 liters of water at 0 degrees Celsius flows into the dam on the second day, then the temperature of the water in the dam will be 0 degrees Celsius. This is because the temperature of the water in the dam is not affected by anything but new water that flows into the dam.
4. The problem statement does not specify how to handle overflows when calculating the maximum possible temperature. For example, if the dam is initially empty and 10 liters of water at 100 degrees Celsius flows into the dam on the first day, then the maximum possible temperature of the water in the dam at noon of the first day is 100 degrees Celsius. However, if 10 liters of water at 0 degrees Celsius flows into the dam on the second day, then the maximum possible temperature of the water in the dam at noon of the second day is 100 degrees Celsius. This is because the temperature of the water in the dam is not affected by anything but new water that flows into the dam.
5. The problem statement does not specify how to handle rounding errors. For example, if the dam is initially empty and 10 liters of water at 100 degrees Celsius flows into the dam on the first day, then the temperature of the water in the dam will be 100 degrees Celsius. However, if 10 liters of water at 0 degrees Celsius flows into the dam on the second day, then the temperature of the water in the dam will be 50 degrees Celsius. This is because the temperature of the water in the dam is not affected by anything but new water that flows into the dam.

Title:
ATCODER p03904 CODE FESTIVAL 2016 Elimination Tournament Round 1 (Parallel) - Problem where Commas Separate Digits

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input string S can contain up to 100,000 digits, so it is important to use a data type that can store that many digits. If you use a data type that is too small, you will get an overflow error.

**2. Not handling the case where K is 0**

If K is 0, then there is no need to insert any commas, so the output should be the same as the input string. Some developers might forget to handle this case, and their code will not work correctly when K is 0.

**3. Not handling the case where S is empty**

If S is empty, then the output should be 0. Some developers might forget to handle this case, and their code will not work correctly when S is empty.

**4. Not handling the case where K is greater than the length of S**

If K is greater than the length of S, then there is no way to insert K commas into S. Some developers might try to insert commas into S even when K is greater than the length of S, and their code will not work correctly.

**5. Using an inefficient algorithm**

The naive algorithm for solving this problem is to consider every possible way to insert K commas into S, and then find the minimum maximum number among all of the possible ways. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(K * |S|^2), which is too slow for large values of K and S.

A more efficient algorithm is to use dynamic programming. The idea is to create a table T where T[i][j] stores the minimum maximum number that can be obtained by inserting j commas into the first i digits of S. We can then fill in the table in a bottom-up fashion, and the final answer will be T[|S|][K].

**6. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it to a contest. This will help you catch any bugs that you may have missed. You can test your code on a variety of input cases, including cases where K is 0, S is empty, K is greater than the length of S, and S contains all 9s.

Title:
AIZU p00010 Circumscribed Circle of a Triangle

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect calculation of the circumscribed circle center**

The circumscribed circle of a triangle is the circle that passes through all three vertices of the triangle. The center of the circumscribed circle is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle's sides. To find the center of the circumscribed circle, we can use the following formula:

```
cx = (x1 + x2 + x3) / 3
cy = (y1 + y2 + y3) / 3
```

where `cx` and `cy` are the coordinates of the circumscribed circle center, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `x3`, `y3` are the coordinates of the triangle's vertices.

However, if the triangle is degenerate (i.e., if two of the vertices are collinear), then the formula above will not give the correct answer. In this case, the circumscribed circle center will be at infinity.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the circumscribed circle radius**

The radius of the circumscribed circle is the distance from the center of the circle to any of the triangle's vertices. To find the radius of the circumscribed circle, we can use the following formula:

```
r = sqrt((cx - x1)^2 + (cy - y1)^2)
```

where `cx` and `cy` are the coordinates of the circumscribed circle center, and `x1` and `y1` are the coordinates of one of the triangle's vertices.

However, if the triangle is degenerate (i.e., if two of the vertices are collinear), then the formula above will not give the correct answer. In this case, the circumscribed circle radius will be undefined.

**3. Incorrect rounding of the solution**

The output of the program should be rounded to three decimal places. However, if the solution is very close to a whole number, then the rounding error may be significant. This can lead to incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect handling of floating-point numbers**

Floating-point numbers are subject to rounding errors. This means that when two floating-point numbers are compared, they may not be equal even if they are very close to each other. This can lead to incorrect results if the program is not careful about how it handles floating-point numbers.

**5. Incorrect handling of degenerate triangles**

As mentioned above, if a triangle is degenerate (i.e., if two of the vertices are collinear), then the circumscribed circle center and radius will be undefined. The program must be careful to handle degenerate triangles correctly.

**6. Incorrect handling of input errors**

The input to the program may contain errors. For example, the input may contain invalid data types, or the input may not be in the correct format. The program must be careful to handle input errors correctly.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input type**. The input should be an odd number n of 10000 or less, but the input may be a non-integer or a number greater than 10000.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be in the following format:

```

But the output may not be in the correct format.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The program may not calculate the frequency of occurrence correctly.
4. **Other bugs**. The program may have other bugs, such as infinite loops or segmentation faults.

AIZU p00275 The Outcome of Bonze

Pain points:
```
1. **Incorrect card counting**

The most important problem that a developer may encounter when solving this problem is incorrect card counting. This can happen if the developer does not correctly track the number of cards that each player has, or if they do not correctly account for the cards that are put into the field. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a player being awarded more cards than they actually have, or a player being awarded cards that they did not actually draw.

2. **Incorrect princess handling**

Another common problem that developers may encounter is incorrect princess handling. This can happen if the developer does not correctly account for the fact that a princess card can be used to collect all of the cards in play. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a player being awarded all of the cards in play, or a player being awarded cards that they did not actually draw.

3. **Incorrect field handling**

Finally, developers may also encounter problems with incorrect field handling. This can happen if the developer does not correctly track the number of cards that are in the field, or if they do not correctly account for the cards that are added to the field. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a player being awarded cards from the field that they did not actually draw, or a player being awarded fewer cards than they actually have.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully track the number of cards that each player has, the number of cards that are in the field, and the number of cards that are drawn from the deck. They should also carefully account for the effects of princess cards and shaved cards. By following these steps, developers can ensure that their programs correctly calculate the number of cards that each player has at the end of the game.

Pain points:
**1. The input data may be malformed.**

The input data may not be in the correct format, or it may contain invalid values. For example, the number of vertical bars may be negative, or the score of a vertical bar may be negative. If the input data is malformed, the program should raise an error.

**2. The program may not be able to find the minimum score.**

The program may not be able to find the minimum score for all possible combinations of horizontal bars. For example, if the number of horizontal bars is greater than the number of vertical bars, there may be no way to delete any horizontal bars. In this case, the program should output the maximum possible score.

**3. The program may be too slow.**

The program may be too slow to find the minimum score for large input data sets. For example, if the number of vertical bars is large, the program may need to consider a large number of possible combinations of horizontal bars. In this case, the program should use a more efficient algorithm to find the minimum score.

**4. The program may not be able to handle all possible input data.**

The program may not be able to handle all possible input data. For example, the program may not be able to handle input data that is generated randomly. In this case, the program should be able to handle a limited set of input data.

AIZU p00653 School of Killifish

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain a number that is too large, or it may contain a string instead of a number. The developer should check the input format and handle errors appropriately.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be in the wrong data type. For example, the input may contain a string when it should contain a number. The developer should check the data type of the input and convert it to the correct data type if necessary.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer may make off-by-one errors when calculating the indices of the grid cells. For example, the developer may calculate the index of a grid cell as `i + 1` instead of `i + 2`. The developer should carefully check their code for off-by-one errors.
4. **Boundary errors**. The developer may make boundary errors when accessing the grid cells. For example, the developer may try to access a grid cell that is outside the bounds of the grid. The developer should carefully check their code for boundary errors.
5. **Logic errors**. The developer may make logic errors in their code. For example, the developer may incorrectly calculate the minimum value in the subgrid. The developer should carefully check their code for logic errors.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully design their algorithm and test their code thoroughly.

Title:
AIZU p00929 There is No Alternative

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly specified in the problem statement. A developer may incorrectly assume that the input is a list of lists, when it is actually a list of tuples. This can lead to errors when trying to access the elements of the input.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the minimum spanning tree**

The minimum spanning tree is a graph that connects all of the vertices in the input graph with the minimum possible total weight. A developer may incorrectly calculate the weight of an edge, or may incorrectly choose which edges to include in the minimum spanning tree. This can lead to an incorrect answer.

**3. Memory leaks**

The problem statement does not specify how much memory the solution should use. A developer may incorrectly allocate memory that is not needed, or may not free memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.

**4. Race conditions**

The problem statement does not specify whether the input graph is guaranteed to be acyclic. If the input graph is cyclic, then there may be multiple minimum spanning trees. A developer may incorrectly assume that there is only one minimum spanning tree, and may attempt to find a minimum spanning tree that does not exist. This can lead to a race condition, where two threads are trying to access the same data at the same time.

**5. Deadlocks**

The problem statement does not specify whether the input graph is guaranteed to be connected. If the input graph is not connected, then there may be no minimum spanning tree. A developer may incorrectly assume that there is always a minimum spanning tree, and may attempt to find a minimum spanning tree that does not exist. This can lead to a deadlock, where two threads are waiting for each other to release a lock.

**6. Incorrect use of concurrency**

The problem statement does not specify whether the solution should be sequential or concurrent. A developer may incorrectly use concurrency, which can lead to errors such as race conditions and deadlocks.

**7. Incorrect use of data structures**

The problem statement does not specify which data structures should be used to represent the input graph and the minimum spanning tree. A developer may incorrectly use data structures, which can lead to errors such as incorrect calculations and memory leaks.

**8. Incorrect use of algorithms**

The problem statement does not specify which algorithms should be used to find the minimum spanning tree. A developer may incorrectly use algorithms, which can lead to incorrect calculations and memory leaks.

**9. Incorrect handling of errors**

The problem statement does not specify how errors should be handled. A developer may incorrectly handle errors, which can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

**10. Incorrect user interface**

The problem statement does not specify how the output should be presented to the user. A developer may incorrectly format the output, or may not provide enough information to the user. This can lead to confusion and frustration for the user.

1. The input format is not correct. The input should be in the format `N M K` where `N` is the number of islands, `M` is the number of ocean liners, and `K` is the maximum number of quarantine stations.
2. The output format is not correct. The output should be either `"Impossible"` or an integer representing the minimum number of quarantine stations required.
3. The code does not correctly handle the case where there is no way to build quarantine stations that satisfies the objective. In this case, the code should print `"Impossible"`.
4. The code does not correctly handle the case where the maximum number of quarantine stations is less than the number of islands. In this case, the code should print `"Impossible"`.
5. The code is not efficient. It takes O(N^2) time to run, where `N` is the number of islands. This can be improved to O(M) time by using a union-find data structure.

AIZU p01947 Ninja Map

Pain points:
Possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible for a developer to make a mistake when parsing the input. For example, the input could contain invalid characters or the numbers could be in the wrong order.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is possible for a developer to make a mistake when formatting the output. For example, the numbers could be in the wrong order or they could be separated by the wrong character.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic used to solve the problem could be incorrect. For example, the developer could forget to take into account all of the constraints of the problem.
* **Off-by-one errors:** Off-by-one errors are a common type of mistake that can occur when programming. In this problem, an off-by-one error could occur if the developer accidentally indexes into the array one position too early or one position too late.
* **Memory leaks:** Memory leaks can occur when a developer allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
* **Stack overflows:** Stack overflows can occur when a developer calls a function that recursively calls itself too many times. This can cause the stack to overflow and the program to crash.
* **Garbage collection errors:** Garbage collection errors can occur when a developer frees memory that is still being used by the program. This can cause the program to crash or to behave incorrectly.
* **Race conditions:** Race conditions can occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to behave incorrectly or to crash.

Title:
AIZU p02234 Matrix Chain Multiplication

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not very clear. It is not immediately obvious that the first line of input is the number of matrices, and that the following lines are the dimensions of each matrix. A developer may incorrectly assume that the first line of input is the dimensions of the first matrix, and the following lines are the dimensions of the remaining matrices. This would result in an incorrect solution.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of scalar multiplications**

The minimum number of scalar multiplications can be calculated using the following formula:

```
min(i, j) * min(j, k) * min(k, l)
```

where `i`, `j`, and `k` are the dimensions of the three matrices being multiplied. A developer may incorrectly calculate the minimum number of scalar multiplications by using a different formula, or by making a mistake in the calculation. This would result in an incorrect solution.

**3. Memory overflow**

The problem states that the number of matrices is at most 100. However, the dimensions of each matrix can be up to 100. This means that the total number of elements in all of the matrices can be up to 100 * 100 = 10000. If a developer does not allocate enough memory for the matrices, the program will crash with a memory overflow error.

**4. Incorrect use of pointers**

The problem requires the developer to use pointers to access the dimensions of the matrices. A developer may incorrectly use pointers, or may not use them at all. This could result in an incorrect solution or a segmentation fault.

**5. Off-by-one errors**

The problem requires the developer to calculate the minimum number of scalar multiplications for a sequence of matrices. A developer may make an off-by-one error when calculating the dimensions of the matrices, or when calculating the minimum number of scalar multiplications. This would result in an incorrect solution.

Title:
AIZU p02380 Triangle

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain non-integer values or the angle may not be in degrees.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the area**. The area of a triangle is given by the formula $S = \frac{1}{2}ab\sin{C}$. If the angle is not in degrees, the sine function must be used with the correct angle unit.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the circumference**. The circumference of a triangle is given by the formula $L = a+b+c$, where $c$ is the third side of the triangle. If the angle is not in degrees, the sine function must be used with the correct angle unit.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the height**. The height of a triangle is given by the formula $h = \frac{2S}{a}$. If the angle is not in degrees, the sine function must be used with the correct angle unit.
5. **Precision errors**. The output should not contain an absolute error greater than 10-4. This may be difficult to achieve if the input values are large or if the angle is close to 90 degrees.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input format and make sure that the calculations are performed correctly. The developer should also be aware of the possibility of precision errors and take steps to minimize them.
