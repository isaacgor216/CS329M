Pain points:
1. **Incorrect formula**. The formula for the sum of first N natural numbers is ```N*(N+1)/2```. The formula for the sum of floor(N/2) for first N natural numbers is ```N*(N+1)/4```.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The floor function rounds down to the nearest integer, so the sum of floor(N/2) for first N natural numbers is one less than the sum of N natural numbers.
3. **Incorrect typecasting**. The floor function returns an integer, so it must be typecasted to a float before it can be used in a calculation.
4. **Incorrect boundary conditions**. The floor function returns ```0``` for negative numbers, so the sum of floor(N/2) for first N natural numbers is ```0``` for N less than or equal to 0.
5. **Incorrect looping**. The loop must iterate from ```1``` to ```N```, not from ```0``` to ```N-1```.
6. **Incorrect output format**. The output must be a single line containing the sum of floor(N/2) for first N natural numbers, not a list of the individual terms.

Title:
CODECHEF opc1604

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the binomial theorem.** The binomial theorem states that for any real numbers $a$ and $b$ and any non-negative integer $n$,

$$(a+b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} a^k b^{n-k}$$

where $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ is the binomial coefficient. In this problem, we are given $a=1$ and $b=x$, and we are asked to find the number of odd coefficients in the expansion of $(1+x)^n$.

A common mistake is to simply use the binomial theorem to expand $(1+x)^n$ and then count the number of odd terms. However, this will not work, because the binomial theorem will also produce even terms.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to use the fact that the coefficients of the odd terms in the expansion of $(1+x)^n$ are given by the binomial coefficients $\binom{n}{k}$, where $k$ is odd. Therefore, the number of odd coefficients in the expansion of $(1+x)^n$ is simply $\sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k}$.

2. **Incorrect use of the factorial function.** The factorial function $n!$ is defined as the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to $n$. In this problem, we need to be careful not to overflow the factorial function when computing $\binom{n}{k}$.

To avoid this problem, we can use the following formula to compute $\binom{n}{k}$:

$$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$

This formula will not overflow the factorial function, even if $n$ is large.

3. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. In this problem, we need to be careful not to use the modulo operator incorrectly.

For example, if we have the expression $101 \% 2$, the modulo operator will return the value 1. However, this is not the correct answer to the problem, because the number of odd coefficients in the expansion of $(1+x)^n$ is not always equal to the remainder of $n$ divided by 2.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to use the following formula to compute the number of odd coefficients in the expansion of $(1+x)^n$:

$$\sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n+1}{2}$$

This formula will always give the correct answer, even if $n$ is odd.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect regular expression**. If the regular expression is not correct, it will not match the pattern correctly. For example, if the regular expression is `^[a-zA-Z]+$`, it will not match the string `12345`.
2. **Incorrect case sensitivity**. If the regular expression is not case sensitive, it will match both upper case and lower case letters. For example, if the regular expression is `^[a-z]+$`, it will match the string `Spoon` and `spoon`.
3. **Incorrect substring matching**. If the regular expression is not using the `^` and `$` characters, it will not match the entire string. For example, if the regular expression is `Spoon`, it will only match the string `Spoon` at the beginning of the input string.
4. **Incorrect anchoring**. If the regular expression is not using the `^` and `$` characters, it will not match the entire string. For example, if the regular expression is `Spoon$`, it will only match the string `Spoon` at the end of the input string.
5. **Incorrect matching order**. If the regular expression is not matching the characters in the correct order, it will not match the pattern correctly. For example, if the regular expression is `Spoon`, it will not match the string `nooSpoon`.
6. **Incorrect quantifiers**. If the regular expression is not using the correct quantifiers, it will not match the pattern correctly. For example, if the regular expression is `Spoon*`, it will match the string `Spoon`, `Spoons`, `Spooning`, etc.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1073_A. Diverse Substring

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the `count()` function.** The `count()` function returns the number of occurrences of a substring in a string. However, it is important to remember that the `count()` function does not take into account the starting position of the substring. For example, the following code will return the number of occurrences of the letter `'a'` in the string `'abc'`:

```
>>> s = 'abc'
>>> s.count('a')
3
```

This is because the `count()` function starts counting from the beginning of the string. If we want to count the number of occurrences of the letter `'a'` starting from the second character in the string, we need to use the `start()` parameter. For example, the following code will return the number of occurrences of the letter `'a'` in the string `'abc'` starting from the second character:

```
>>> s = 'abc'
>>> s.count('a', 1)
2
```

2. **Incorrect use of the `find()` function.** The `find()` function returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string. However, it is important to remember that the `find()` function does not take into account the starting position of the substring. For example, the following code will return the index of the first occurrence of the letter `'a'` in the string `'abc'`:

```
>>> s = 'abc'
>>> s.find('a')
0
```

This is because the `find()` function starts searching from the beginning of the string. If we want to search for the first occurrence of the letter `'a'` starting from the second character in the string, we need to use the `start()` parameter. For example, the following code will return the index of the first occurrence of the letter `'a'` in the string `'abc'` starting from the second character:

```
>>> s = 'abc'
>>> s.find('a', 1)
1
```

3. **Incorrect use of the `slice()` function.** The `slice()` function returns a substring of a string. However, it is important to remember that the `slice()` function does not take into account the starting position of the substring. For example, the following code will return the substring of the string `'abc'` starting from the second character:

```
>>> s = 'abc'
>>> s[1:]
'bc'
```

This is because the `slice()` function starts slicing from the beginning of the string. If we want to slice the string `'abc'` starting from the second character, we need to use the `start()` parameter. For example, the following code will return the substring of the string `'abc'` starting from the second character:

```
>>> s = 'abc'
>>> s[1:]
'bc'

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly calculating the number of piles.** The input states that `n` is an even number, so the number of piles must be divisible by 2. However, a developer may accidentally divide `n` by 2 and then round down, resulting in an incorrect number of piles.
2. **Incorrectly choosing the piles to remove stones from.** The player must choose exactly `n / 2` nonempty piles to remove stones from. However, a developer may accidentally choose more or fewer piles, resulting in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrectly calculating the number of stones to remove from each pile.** The player must remove a positive number of stones from each of the chosen piles. However, a developer may accidentally remove 0 stones from a pile, resulting in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrectly determining who wins the game.** The first player unable to make a move loses. However, a developer may incorrectly determine that the game is a tie, resulting in an incorrect answer.

CODEFORCES 1183_D. Candy Box (easy version)

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a list of integers. If you use the wrong data type to store the input data, you may get incorrect results. For example, if you use a list of strings to store the input data, you may get incorrect results because the comparison between strings is not the same as the comparison between integers.

**2. Not handling the corner cases**

The problem statement mentions that the number of candies can be as large as 2\*10^5. If you do not handle the corner cases, your program may crash when the input data is too large.

**3. Using an inefficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved in O(n) time. If you use an inefficient algorithm, your program may run slowly.

**4. Not using the right data structure**

The problem can be solved using a hash table. If you do not use the right data structure, your program may run slowly.

**5. Making a mistake in the implementation**

Even if you follow the above suggestions, you may still make a mistake in the implementation. Carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand the problem before you start coding.

CODEFORCES 1200_E. Compress Words

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not strictly defined. For example, the input could be in the following formats:

```
1
a
```

```
1
a b
```

```
10
a b c d e f g h i j
```

```
1000000
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will output incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is also not strictly defined. For example, the output could be in the following formats:

```
sampleaseinout
```

```
sampleaseinout\n
```

```
sampleaseinout 
```

```
sampleaseinout 

```

If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will receive a negative score.

**3. Incorrect merging algorithm**

The merging algorithm is the most important part of the program. If the algorithm is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce the correct output.

There are a few common mistakes that developers make when implementing the merging algorithm.

* **Using the wrong data structure**. The merging algorithm requires a data structure that can efficiently store and compare strings. A common mistake is to use a data structure that is not designed for this purpose, such as a linked list or an array.
* **Using the wrong merging algorithm**. There are a few different merging algorithms that can be used. The most common algorithm is the merge sort algorithm. A common mistake is to use a different merging algorithm, such as the quick sort algorithm.
* **Not handling special cases correctly**. The merging algorithm must be able to handle special cases correctly, such as when the two strings are equal or when one of the strings is empty. A common mistake is to not handle these cases correctly, which can lead to incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect error handling**

The program should be able to handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input format is incorrect, the program should print an error message and exit.

A common mistake is to not handle errors correctly. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

**5. Inefficient code**

The program should be as efficient as possible. This means that it should use the most efficient data structures and algorithms.

A common mistake is to use inefficient code. This can lead to the program running slowly or using too much memory.

**6. Unclear code**

The code should be clear and easy to read. This means that it should be well-commented and use descriptive variable names.

A common mistake is to write unclear code. This can make it difficult for other developers to understand the code and debug it.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when writing it. For example, if you forget to put a space between the two numbers, or if you put the wrong number of flights, the program will not be able to parse the output correctly.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic of the program is also very important. If you make a mistake in the logic, the program will not be able to solve the problem correctly. For example, if you forget to check that the number of flights between two spaceports is different, the program will not be able to find a solution.

**4. Memory errors**

If the program is not written efficiently, it can run out of memory and crash. This is especially likely to happen if the input is large.

**5. Time errors**

If the program is not written efficiently, it can take a long time to run. This is especially likely to happen if the input is large.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1242_D. Number Discovery

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement says that "Ujan will stop procrastinating when he writes the number n in the sequence s. Help him find the index of n in s." This means that we need to find the position of n in the sequence s, not the position of the first occurrence of n in s.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for finding the index of n in s is as follows:

```
1. Initialize a set S to be empty.
2. While n is not in S:
    * Find the k smallest distinct positive integers that are not in S.
    * Append these integers to S.
    * Append their sum to S.
3. Return the index of n in S.
```

This algorithm is correct, but it is not efficient. A more efficient algorithm is as follows:

```
1. Initialize a set S to be empty.
2. While n is not in S:
    * Find the smallest positive integer that is not in S.
    * Append this integer to S.
3. Return the index of n in S.
```

This algorithm is more efficient because it does not need to find the k smallest distinct positive integers that are not in S.
3. **Incorrect input handling.** The input format for this problem is as follows:

```
The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{5}), the number of test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{18}, 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^{6}), the number to be found in the sequence s and the parameter used to create the sequence s.
```

It is important to make sure that you correctly parse the input format. For example, if you accidentally read the first line as a single integer instead of a list of integers, you will get the wrong answer.
4. **Incorrect output formatting.** The output format for this problem is as follows:

```
For each test case, output a single integer on a new line, the index of n in s.
```

It is important to make sure that your output format is correct. For example, if you accidentally print the index of n in s on the same line as the test case, your submission will be incorrect.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1261_D1. Wrong Answer on test 233 (Easy Version)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of modulo operator.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. For example, the following code will incorrectly calculate the remainder of 10 divided by 3:

```
remainder = 10 % 3
```

The correct way to calculate the remainder is to use the `%` operator:

```
remainder = 10 % 3
```

2. **Off-by-one errors.** These errors occur when a programmer forgets to add or subtract one from a calculation. For example, the following code will incorrectly calculate the sum of the first 10 integers:

```
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 11):
    sum += i
```

The correct way to calculate the sum is to use the `range()` function to start at 0 and end at 10:

```
sum = 0
for i in range(0, 11):
    sum += i
```

3. **Incorrect use of parentheses.** Parentheses can be used to group expressions together and to change the order of operations. For example, the following two expressions have different meanings:

```
a + b * c
(a + b) * c
```

The first expression evaluates to `a + (b * c)`, while the second expression evaluates to `(a + b) * c`.

4. **Using the wrong data type.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. For example, the following code will incorrectly calculate the square root of 10:

```
sqrt = 10 ** 0.5
```

The correct way to calculate the square root of 10 is to use the `math.sqrt()` function:

```
sqrt = math.sqrt(10)
```

5. **Not handling edge cases.** Edge cases are special cases that can cause a program to crash or produce incorrect results. For example, the following code will incorrectly calculate the factorial of -1:

```
factorial = math.factorial(-1)
```

The correct way to handle the edge case of `n < 0` is to return `0` instead of calculating the factorial:

```
if n < 0:
    return 0
else:
    return math.factorial(n)
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 1283_F. DIY Garland

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not strictly defined. For example, the input ```5
1 2 3 4 5``` is not valid, because it does not contain the number of lamps. The developer should check the input format and return an error message if it is incorrect.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is also not strictly defined. For example, the output ```6 3 6 5 1 2``` is not valid, because it does not contain the index of the lamp connected to the grid. The developer should check the output format and return an error message if it is incorrect.

**3. Incorrect solution**

The developer may come up with a solution that is incorrect. For example, the following solution is incorrect:

```
def main():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 1:
        print(1)
        return
    print(-1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This solution will print ```-1``` for any input, even if the input is valid. The developer should make sure that the solution is correct for all possible inputs.

**4. Runtime error**

The developer's solution may have a runtime error. For example, the following solution has a runtime error:

```
def main():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 1:
        print(1)
        return
    for i in range(n - 1):
        print(a[i], a[i + 1])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This solution will cause a ```RecursionError```, because the ```for``` loop will call itself infinitely. The developer should make sure that the solution does not have any runtime errors.

**5. Memory error**

The developer's solution may also have a memory error. For example, the following solution has a memory error:

```
def main():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 1:
        print(1)
        return
    for i in range(n - 1):
        print(a[i], a[i + 1])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This solution will cause a ```MemoryError```, because the ```list``` of ```a``` will grow infinitely. The developer should make sure that the solution does not have any memory errors.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1303_B. National Project

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be a single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4) on the first line, followed by T lines, each containing three integers n, g and b (1 ≤ n, g, b ≤ 10^9).
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer on each line, corresponding to the minimum number of days required to repair the whole highway if at least half of it should have high quality.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of days**. The minimum number of days required to repair the whole highway if at least half of it should have high quality is the minimum of the following two values:
    * The number of good days in the current season.
    * The number of days required to repair the remaining part of the highway (n - g).
4. **Off-by-one errors**. When calculating the number of good days in the current season, it is important to remember that the first g days are good.
5. **Inefficient algorithms**. The naive algorithm for calculating the minimum number of days required to repair the whole highway has a time complexity of O(T * n), which is too slow for large values of T and n. A more efficient algorithm can be used to achieve a time complexity of O(T * log n).

CODEFORCES 1327_C. Game with Chips

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of rows and columns is not specified, or if the number of chips is not specified, the program will not be able to correctly process the input and will produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data**. The data provided in the input may not be correct, which can also lead to errors in the program. For example, if the starting position of a chip is outside the bounds of the board, or if the position that a chip should visit is also outside the bounds of the board, the program will not be able to correctly process the input and will produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, which can also lead to errors in the output. For example, if the program does not correctly check if a chip has visited the position that it is supposed to visit, or if the program does not correctly calculate the number of operations required to move all of the chips to their respective positions, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. The program may be incorrectly implemented, which can also lead to errors in the output. For example, if the program uses incorrect data types, or if the program does not correctly handle errors, the output will be incorrect.
5. **Incorrect testing**. The program may not be tested correctly, which can also lead to errors in the output. For example, if the program is not tested with a variety of different inputs, or if the program is not tested with inputs that are likely to cause errors, the output will be incorrect.

CODEFORCES 1368_C. Even Picture

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). If the input is not in the correct format, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5) followed by k lines of two integers each. If the output is not in the correct format, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect cell coordinates.** The coordinates of the gray cells must be distinct and must not exceed 10^9 by absolute value. If any of the cell coordinates are incorrect, the program will crash.
4. **Inconsistent number of gray cells.** The number of gray cells in the output must be equal to the number of gray cells with all gray neighbours in the input. If the number of gray cells in the output is not equal to the number of gray cells with all gray neighbours in the input, the program will produce an incorrect output.
5. **Disconnected picture.** The picture must be connected, which means that it must be possible to get from any gray cell to any other by following a chain of gray cells. If the picture is not connected, the program will produce an incorrect output.
6. **Cells with odd number of gray neighbors.** Each gray cell must have an even number of gray neighbors. If any of the gray cells has an odd number of gray neighbors, the program will produce an incorrect output.

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format of the problem is not followed correctly, which may result in the program crashing or giving incorrect output. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The data type of the input values may not be correct, which may result in the program crashing or giving incorrect output. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program may crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors occur when the programmer forgets to add or subtract one from a calculation. This can result in the program giving incorrect output. For example, if the programmer forgets to add one to the number of vertices in a graph, the program may incorrectly calculate the maximum clique size.
4. **Logic errors.** Logic errors occur when the programmer makes a mistake in the logic of the program. This can result in the program giving incorrect output. For example, if the programmer incorrectly checks whether two vertices are connected in a graph, the program may incorrectly calculate the maximum clique size.
5. **Memory leaks.** Memory leaks occur when the programmer does not free up memory that is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program crashing.
6. **Race conditions.** Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program giving incorrect output or crashing.
7. **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can lead to the program crashing.

**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement is quite long and detailed, so it is important to read it carefully and make sure that you understand all of the requirements.
* **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution to this problem involves a number of different steps, so it is important to make sure that each step is implemented correctly.
* **Incorrect testing of the solution.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly on all possible inputs.
* **Incorrect submission of the solution.** Make sure that you submit your solution in the correct format and that you include all of the required information.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly calculating the number of cells that can't be melted.** The number of cells that can't be melted is equal to the number of cells in the field that are not in the same row or column as either of the lasers.
* **Incorrectly moving the lasers.** The lasers can only be moved parallel to the sides of the field.
* **Incorrectly handling the case where the lasers are initially pointed at the same cell.** In this case, the chocolate can't be melted at all.
* **Incorrectly handling the case where the lasers are initially pointed at cells that are not in the same row or column.** In this case, the chocolate can be melted at all of the cells in the field that are not in the same row or column as either of the lasers.

CODEFORCES 178_F2. Representative Sampling

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if the input contains two integers separated by a comma, but the second integer is not a number, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not strictly defined, but it is important to make sure that the output is in the correct format. For example, if the output is not a single number, the program will not be accepted.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the representativity**

The representativity of a collection of proteins is calculated by a simple formula, but it is easy to make a mistake when implementing the calculation. For example, if you forget to take the maximum value of the representativity of all possible subcollections, the program will not give the correct answer.

**4. Incorrect choice of the subcollection**

The goal of the problem is to find a subcollection of size k that has the largest possible representativity. However, it is easy to make a mistake when choosing the subcollection. For example, if you choose a subcollection that does not contain any common prefixes, the representativity of the subcollection will be zero.

**5. Time complexity**

The time complexity of the program should be O(n*k), where n is the number of proteins and k is the size of the subcollection. If the time complexity is too high, the program will not be able to solve the problem in time.

CODEFORCES 201_E. Thoroughly Bureaucratic Organization

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is two integers n and m, separated by a single space. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash. For example, if the input is "4 1 2", the program will crash because there is an extra number 2 after the space.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is a single integer, which is the minimum number of requests needed to submit to TBO. If the output format is incorrect, the program will crash. For example, if the output is "4 1 a", the program will crash because the output is not a single integer.

**3. Undefined behavior**

The program may exhibit undefined behavior if it is passed invalid input. For example, if the input is "n < 1", the program may crash or it may output incorrect results.

**4. Memory leaks**

The program may leak memory if it does not properly free the memory that it allocates. This can lead to a slow down in performance and, in some cases, to a crash.

**5. Race conditions**

The program may exhibit race conditions if it accesses shared data without synchronization. This can lead to incorrect results or, in some cases, to a crash.

**6. Deadlocks**

The program may deadlock if it enters a situation where it is waiting for a resource that is never released. This can lead to a hang or, in some cases, to a crash.

**7. Security vulnerabilities**

The program may be vulnerable to security attacks if it does not properly validate user input. This can allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system or to execute arbitrary code.

**8. Other bugs**

There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. Some of the most common include:

* Off-by-one errors
* Incorrect loop conditions
* Incorrect variable initialization
* Incorrect function calls
* Incorrect data types
* Incorrect logic
* Uninitialized variables
* Use of uninitialized variables
* Dereferencing null pointers
* Memory corruption

CODEFORCES 226_D. The table

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in parsing the input data. For example, if the number of rows and columns are not separated by a space, the program may misinterpret the input and crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong type, which can also lead to errors. For example, if the numbers in the table are not integers, the program may not be able to correctly calculate the sums of the rows and columns.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating over the rows and columns of the table, it is important to make sure that the indices are correct. An off-by-one error can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program does not correctly account for all of the possible cases, it may not be able to find a solution to the problem.
5. **Memory errors**. The program may not be able to allocate enough memory to store the data, which can lead to errors. For example, if the table is very large, the program may run out of memory and crash.
6. **Timeout errors**. The program may take too long to run, which can lead to a timeout error. For example, if the table is very large, the program may take a long time to calculate the sums of the rows and columns.
7. **Other errors**. There are a number of other possible errors that could occur when solving this problem. For example, the program may encounter a divide-by-zero error if one of the sums of the rows or columns is zero.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a line with more than one IPv6 address, or a line with characters that are not allowed in an IPv6 address.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may contain a line with more than one IPv6 address, or a line with characters that are not allowed in an IPv6 address.
3. **Incorrect solution.** The solution does not correctly restore the full IPv6 address from the given short IPv6 address. For example, the solution may omit or add leading zeroes, or it may not correctly handle zero blocks.
4. **Time complexity.** The solution's time complexity is too high. For example, the solution may iterate over all possible combinations of leading zeroes and zero blocks, or it may use a recursive algorithm that has a factorial time complexity.
5. **Space complexity.** The solution's space complexity is too high. For example, the solution may create a large array to store all possible combinations of leading zeroes and zero blocks, or it may use a recursive algorithm that creates a large stack.

Title:
CODEFORCES 275_C. k-Multiple Free Set

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains integers that can be up to 10^9 in size. If we use an integer data type to store these values, we may encounter overflow errors. To avoid this, we should use a larger data type, such as long long.

**2. Not handling duplicate elements correctly**

The input may contain duplicate elements. If we do not handle these elements correctly, we may get incorrect results. We can handle duplicate elements by simply ignoring them.

**3. Not considering the special case of k = 1**

When k = 1, every set is k-multiple free. We need to handle this special case separately.

**4. Using an inefficient algorithm**

The naive algorithm for solving this problem would be to consider every possible subset of the input set and check if it is k-multiple free. This algorithm would have a time complexity of O(2^n), which is too slow for large values of n.

We can improve the time complexity of the algorithm by using a divide and conquer approach. This approach would have a time complexity of O(n log n).

**5. Not using a fast sorting algorithm**

Sorting the input set can help us to find the largest k-multiple free subset more efficiently. We can use a fast sorting algorithm, such as quicksort, to sort the input set.

**6. Not using a data structure that supports fast lookups**

We can use a data structure that supports fast lookups to find the largest k-multiple free subset more efficiently. We can use a hash table or a binary search tree to store the elements of the input set.

CODEFORCES 321_C. Ciel the Commander

Pain points:
1. **Inconsistent input data.** The input may contain invalid data, such as a negative number or a number that is too large. The developer should check the input data for validity and raise an error if it is invalid.
2. **Incorrect algorithm.** The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm that does not produce the correct output. This could be due to a logical error in the algorithm, or a mistake in the implementation.
3. **Memory errors.** The developer may allocate too much memory or not enough memory. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
4. **Time errors.** The developer may implement an algorithm that takes too long to run. This could make the program unusable for large inputs.
5. **User errors.** The user may provide invalid input data or use the program in an incorrect way. The developer should design the program to handle these errors gracefully.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully design the program and test it thoroughly. The developer should also use a debugger to find and fix any errors that are found.

CODEFORCES 346_A. Alice and Bob

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specified in the problem statement is "The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the initial number of elements in the set. The second line contains n distinct space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — the elements of the set.". If the input format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The problem statement specifies that the input numbers should be integers. If the input numbers are not integers, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The program may incorrectly check if a number is in the set. For example, if the set contains the numbers 1, 2, and 3, the program may incorrectly check if 4 is in the set.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The program may incorrectly implement the game rules. For example, the program may incorrectly check if a player has a valid move.
5. **Infinite loop**. The program may enter an infinite loop if it does not properly handle certain cases. For example, the program may enter an infinite loop if it tries to remove a number from the set that is not in the set.

Title:
CODEFORCES 369_E. Valera and Queries

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if you forget to add a newline character at the end of the output, the program will not be able to produce the correct output.

**3. Incorrect data type**

The data types of the input and output values are not always explicitly specified, so it is easy to make a mistake when casting the values to the correct data type. For example, if you try to compare a string to a number, the program will not be able to perform the comparison correctly.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when you forget to add or subtract one from a value. For example, if you are counting the number of elements in an array, you might forget to add one to the index when you are looping through the array.

**5. Logical errors**

Logical errors are errors that occur when the program is not doing what you intended it to do. For example, you might write a program to sort a list of numbers, but the program might actually sort the list in reverse order.

**6. Infinite loops**

Infinite loops are a type of bug that occurs when the program enters a loop that never terminates. For example, if you have a loop that is always true, the program will never be able to exit the loop.

**7. Memory leaks**

Memory leaks are a type of bug that occurs when the program allocates memory that is never freed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

**8. Race conditions**

Race conditions are a type of bug that occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results or even crashing.

CODEFORCES 391_D1. Supercollider

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. This could happen if the input file is corrupted or if the developer made a mistake when writing the code to read the input.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data types of the input values may not be correct. For example, the `xi`, `yi`, and `li` values should be integers, but the developer may have accidentally read them as floats.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer may have made a mistake when calculating the intersection point of two line segments or the distance from the intersection point to the closest endpoint.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may have made a mistake in the algorithm for finding the largest supercollider. For example, the developer may have forgotten to consider all possible pairs of north-south and west-east tracts.
5. **Memory errors**. The developer may have allocated too much or too little memory for the data structures used in the program. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
6. **Time complexity**. The developer may have used an algorithm with a time complexity that is too high for the given problem. This could lead to the program running too slowly or even crashing.
7. **Space complexity**. The developer may have used data structures with a space complexity that is too high for the given problem. This could lead to the program running out of memory or even crashing.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the code thoroughly with a variety of input data. Finally, it is important to use efficient algorithms and data structures to minimize the time and space complexity of the program.
Test inputs:
**Incorrect input format**

```

**Off-by-one errors**

```
1 2
4 0 9
1 1 8
1 2 6
```

The correct output for this input should be 2, but the program outputs 3. This is because the developer made a mistake when calculating the distance from the intersection point to the closest endpoint.

**Incorrect logic**

```
1 2
4 0 9
1 1 8
1 2 7
```

The correct output for this input should be 2, but the program outputs 1. This is because the developer forgot to consider all possible pairs of north-south and west-east tracts.

**Memory errors**

```

CODEFORCES 413_E. Maze 2D

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading it. For example, if you forget to add a space between the two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when writing it. For example, if you forget to add a newline character at the end of each line, the output will be incorrect.

**3. Mismatched dimensions**

The maze is represented as a two-dimensional array, and the dimensions of the array must match the dimensions of the maze. If the dimensions don't match, the program will not be able to find the shortest path.

**4. Obstacles in the path**

The shortest path cannot go through obstacles. If there is an obstacle in the path, the program will return -1.

**5. Unreachable cells**

Some cells in the maze may be unreachable. If a cell is unreachable, the program will return -1.

**6. Incorrect queries**

The queries must be in the correct format. For example, the queries must specify two valid cell numbers. If a query is incorrect, the program will return -1.

**7. Infinite loops**

The program must not enter an infinite loop. If the program enters an infinite loop, it will not terminate and the user will have to terminate it manually.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is `1 2 3`, the program should expect 3 integers, but only 2 are provided.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the output is `123`, the program should expect a single integer, but 3 are provided.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The program may not correctly calculate the minimum number of moves required to achieve the desired configuration. For example, if the input is `6`, the program should output `12`, but outputs `13`.
4. **Incorrect error handling**. The program may not handle errors correctly. For example, if the input is invalid, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.
5. **Inefficient algorithm**. The program may use an inefficient algorithm to solve the problem, which may lead to a long running time. For example, the program may use a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem, which would take a long time for large inputs.
6. **Memory leaks**. The program may not free up memory that it has allocated, which may lead to a memory leak. For example, the program may create a large array and never delete it, which would eventually lead to a memory overflow.

2. **Incorrect edge representation**. The edges of the tree are represented as a list of pairs of vertices. However, if the list is not correctly formatted, the program may not be able to correctly identify the edges.
3. **Incorrect vertex coloring**. The vertices of the tree are colored as either black or white. However, if the colors are not correctly represented, the program may not be able to correctly identify the black vertices.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the number of ways to split the tree**. The number of ways to split the tree is calculated by multiplying the number of ways to choose the black vertex by the number of ways to split the remaining tree. However, if this calculation is not done correctly, the program may output an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect modulo operation**. The final answer is modulo 1000000007. However, if the modulo operation is not done correctly, the program may output an incorrect answer.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format, the edge representation, the vertex coloring, the calculation of the number of ways to split the tree, and the modulo operation.

Title:
CODEFORCES 50_B. Choosing Symbol Pairs

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input string may contain characters that are not numbers, so it is important to use the `str` data type to store the input.

**2. Using the wrong index**

The indices of the characters in the string start at 0, not 1. So, when accessing the characters in the string, you need to use `i - 1` instead of `i`.

**3. Not considering the order of the pairs**

The problem asks for the number of ordered pairs of integers, so you need to make sure that you are counting the pairs in the correct order.

**4. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The naive algorithm for counting the number of pairs of equal characters in a string takes O(n^2) time. There are more efficient algorithms that can be used to solve this problem in O(n) time.

**5. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input string is empty. You should make sure to handle this case gracefully.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always strictly followed, and the developer may not handle all possible cases. For example, the input may contain a non-integer number, or the number of vertices may be less than 3.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format also needs to be strictly followed. For example, the output may not have the correct number of digits after the decimal point, or it may contain non-numeric characters.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the expected value**. The expected value is a sum of the products of the probabilities of each possible outcome and the value of that outcome. The developer may make a mistake in calculating this sum, or they may not account for all possible outcomes.
4. **Incorrect use of floating-point arithmetic**. Floating-point arithmetic is notoriously imprecise, and the developer may make a mistake if they do not take this into account. For example, the developer may compare two floating-point numbers that are not equal to each other, or they may round a number to the wrong number of digits.
5. **Other bugs**. There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the developer may use an incorrect algorithm, or they may not handle all possible errors.

Title:
CODEFORCES 585_B. Phillip and Trains

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrectly identifying the starting position of Philip.** The starting position of Philip is always the leftmost column of the field. It is easy to make a mistake and think that Philip starts in the middle of the field or in one of the other rows.
2. **Not taking into account the movement of the trains.** The trains move twice as fast as Philip, so it is important to keep track of their position and make sure that Philip does not get caught in their path.
3. **Not considering all possible moves for Philip.** Philip can move one cell to the right, up, or down, or stay in the same place. It is important to consider all of these possibilities and choose the best one for each situation.
4. **Making a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for solving this problem is relatively simple, but it is easy to make a mistake in the implementation. It is important to carefully check the code for errors before running it.
5. **Not handling all possible cases.** The input data for this problem can be quite tricky, and it is important to handle all possible cases. For example, the input data could contain a train that spans multiple rows or columns, or the input data could contain a train that is not completely aligned with the grid. It is important to make sure that the algorithm can handle all of these cases.

**Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:**

1. **Draw a picture of the grid and the trains to help you visualize the problem.** This can help you to identify the starting position of Philip and the movement of the trains.
2. **Write out the steps of the algorithm in pseudocode before you start coding.** This will help you to identify any potential problems with the algorithm.
3. **Test your code thoroughly with a variety of input data.** This will help you to catch any errors in the implementation.
4. **Be careful not to make any assumptions about the input data.** The input data could be quite tricky, so it is important to make sure that you are not making any assumptions about it.
5. **Ask for help if you are stuck.** There are many online resources available to help you solve this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 607_B. Zuma

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is `n`, followed by a line of `n` space-separated integers. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will output an incorrect answer.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer, which is the minimum number of seconds needed to destroy the entire line. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be accepted.

**3. Undefined behavior**

The program may exhibit undefined behavior if it attempts to access an element of an array that is out of bounds. This can happen if the input size is larger than the array size, or if the program attempts to access an element of an array that has already been deleted.

**4. Memory leaks**

The program may leak memory if it does not properly free the memory that it allocates. This can happen if the program creates a dynamically allocated object and then forgets to delete it, or if the program creates a pointer to a dynamically allocated object and then loses the pointer.

**5. Race conditions**

The program may exhibit race conditions if it accesses shared data from multiple threads without proper synchronization. This can happen if the program uses multiple threads to access the same data without using locks or other synchronization mechanisms.

**6. Deadlocks**

The program may deadlock if it enters a situation where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can happen if the program uses locks without properly ensuring that the locks are released in a consistent order.

**7. Incorrect algorithm**

The program may output an incorrect answer if it uses an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. This can happen if the program does not take into account all of the constraints of the problem, or if the program uses an inefficient algorithm.

CODEFORCES 653_B. Bear and Compressing

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The variable `n` should be of type `int`, but it is of type `str`. This will cause a `TypeError`.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator.** The condition `n == 1` should be `n == 1`, but it is `n = 1`. This will cause a `ValueError`.
3. **Incorrect loop condition.** The loop should be terminated when `i == len(operations)`, but it is terminated when `i == len(operations) - 1`. This will cause a `IndexError`.
4. **Incorrect variable assignment.** The variable `result` should be assigned the value of `1`, but it is assigned the value of `0`. This will cause the program to output the wrong answer.
5. **Incorrect function call.** The function `count_strings()` should be called with the arguments `n` and `operations`, but it is called with the arguments `n` and `operations[0]`. This will cause the program to output the wrong answer.

To avoid these problems, make sure to carefully check your code for errors before submitting it. Here are some tips:

* Use the `type()` function to check the type of a variable.
* Use the `==` operator to compare two values.
* Make sure that your loop conditions are correct.
* Make sure that you assign variables the correct values.
* Make sure that you call functions with the correct arguments.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program's logic. For example, if the number of cards is not even, the program will not be able to find a solution.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program's output. For example, if the cards are not numbered in the order they appear in the input, the program's output will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program may not be able to find a solution to the problem, even if one exists. This could be due to a number of factors, such as using an incorrect algorithm or making a mistake in the implementation.
4. **Runtime errors**. The program may crash or run out of memory while trying to find a solution to the problem. This could be due to a number of factors, such as using an inefficient algorithm or allocating too much memory.
5. **Incorrect test cases**. The test cases used to verify the program's correctness may not be comprehensive. This could lead to the program being incorrectly declared as correct, even if it contains errors.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully follow the input and output format, use a correct algorithm, and test the program thoroughly with a variety of test cases.

CODEFORCES 723_B. Text Document Analysis

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect regular expression**. The regular expression used to match words may not be correct. For example, the following regular expression `r"\w+"` will not match words that contain underscores.
2. **Incorrect use of `finditer()`**. The `finditer()` method returns an iterator of `Match` objects, each of which represents a match of the regular expression in the string. The following code will not work correctly:

```
for match in re.finditer(r"\w+", text):
    # Do something with the match
```

This is because the `finditer()` method returns an iterator of `Match` objects, not a list of `Match` objects. To get a list of `Match` objects, you can use the `list()` function:

```
matches = list(re.finditer(r"\w+", text))
```

3. **Incorrect use of `group()`**. The `group()` method of a `Match` object returns the text that matched the regular expression. The following code will not work correctly:

```
for match in re.finditer(r"\w+", text):
    length = len(match)
```

This is because the `group()` method returns a string, not an integer. To get the length of the matched text, you can use the `len()` function:

```
for match in re.finditer(r"\w+", text):
    length = len(match.group())
```

4. **Incorrect handling of parentheses**. The regular expression used to match words may not correctly handle parentheses. For example, the following regular expression `r"\w+(?=\))"` will not match words that end with a parenthesis.
5. **Incorrect handling of underscores**. The regular expression used to match words may not correctly handle underscores. For example, the following regular expression `r"\w+"` will not match words that contain underscores.

To avoid these problems, carefully review your regular expression and make sure that it is correct. Also, make sure that you are using the `finditer()` method correctly and that you are using the `group()` method correctly. Finally, make sure that you are handling parentheses and underscores correctly.

CODEFORCES 745_A. Hongcow Learns the Cyclic Shift

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be a single string of lowercase English letters. If the input is not in the correct format, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer. If the output is not in the correct format, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of distinct strings**. The number of distinct strings that Hongcow can generate by applying the cyclic shift arbitrarily many times is equal to the length of the string. If the program incorrectly calculates the number of distinct strings, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect use of the cyclic shift operation**. The cyclic shift operation involves moving the last character of the string to the beginning of the string. If the program incorrectly implements the cyclic shift operation, the output will be incorrect.
5. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:
    * Incorrect use of variables
    * Incorrect logic
    * Incorrect error handling
    * Incorrect use of libraries
    * Other runtime errors

CODEFORCES 768_C. Jon Snow and his Favourite Number

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The input contains three integers, but the code is expecting four. This will cause a `ValueError`.
2. **Incorrect variable initialization.** The code initializes `max_strength` and `min_strength` to 0, but these variables should be initialized to the minimum and maximum values in the input, respectively. This will cause the code to output incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect calculation of maximum and minimum strength.** The code calculates the maximum and minimum strength by iterating over the input and finding the largest and smallest values, respectively. However, this does not take into account the effect of the `k` operations. To correctly calculate the maximum and minimum strength, the code needs to iterate over the input after the `k` operations have been performed.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The code outputs the maximum and minimum strength as two separate integers, but the problem statement requires them to be outputted as a single line with two space-separated integers. This will cause the code to receive a `Wrong Answer` verdict.
5. **Incorrect use of `XOR`.** The code uses the `XOR` operator to calculate the maximum and minimum strength. However, this is incorrect because the `XOR` operator does not preserve the order of the operands. To correctly calculate the maximum and minimum strength, the code needs to use the `min()` and `max()` functions.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully check the input and output formats, and make sure that your code is correctly calculating the maximum and minimum strength. You should also use the `assert` statement to check for errors in your code.

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the number of children.**

The input specifies that there are n children, but if you use an integer data type to store this value, you may run into problems if n is larger than the maximum value for an integer. To avoid this, you should use a long integer data type.

**2. Using the wrong data type for the number of steps.**

The input specifies that there are k steps, but if you use an integer data type to store this value, you may run into problems if k is larger than the maximum value for an integer. To avoid this, you should use a long integer data type.

**3. Using the wrong data type for the array of ai values.**

The input specifies that there are k ai values, but if you use an integer array to store these values, you may run into problems if k is larger than the maximum size of an integer array. To avoid this, you should use a long integer array.

**4. Using the wrong index for the array of ai values.**

The array of ai values is indexed from 1, but if you start your loop at index 0, you will skip the first ai value. To avoid this, make sure to start your loop at index 1.

**5. Using the wrong index for the array of children.**

The array of children is indexed from 1, but if you start your loop at index 0, you will skip the first child. To avoid this, make sure to start your loop at index 1.

**6. Forgetting to update the leader after each step.**

The leader is the child who is currently pointing at the person who is being eliminated. After each step, the leader is the child who is immediately clockwise from the person who was just eliminated. To make sure that the leader is updated correctly, you need to update it at the end of each step.

**7. Using the wrong formula to calculate the next leader.**

The formula for calculating the next leader is `(currentLeader + ai) % n + 1`. If you use the wrong formula, you will not get the correct answer.

Title:
CODEFORCES 812_D. Sagheer and Kindergarten

Pain points:
## 1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm

One of the most common problems that developers encounter when solving a problem is incorrect implementation of the algorithm. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as:

* Misunderstanding the problem statement
* Making a mistake in the implementation
* Not testing the code thoroughly

To avoid this problem, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement. It is also helpful to write out the algorithm in pseudocode before implementing it in code. Finally, it is essential to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct.

## 2. Using incorrect data structures

Another common problem that developers encounter is using incorrect data structures. This can lead to inefficient code and incorrect results.

For example, if you are trying to find the maximum value in an array, you should use a `maxheap` data structure instead of a `minheap`. This is because a `maxheap` will always return the largest element in the array, while a `minheap` will always return the smallest element.

To avoid this problem, it is important to choose the correct data structure for the problem you are trying to solve. There are many different data structures available, so it is important to do some research to find the one that is best suited for your needs.

## 3. Not handling edge cases

Edge cases are special cases that can occur in a program that are not handled by the normal code. These cases can often lead to incorrect results or crashes.

For example, if you are writing a program to sort an array, you need to make sure that the array is not empty. If the array is empty, the sorting algorithm will not work correctly.

To avoid this problem, it is important to test your code for edge cases. This can be done by manually entering edge cases into the program or by using a test framework.

## 4. Using too much memory

Another common problem that developers encounter is using too much memory. This can lead to the program running slowly or even crashing.

To avoid this problem, it is important to be aware of the amount of memory that your program is using. You can do this by using a memory profiler. A memory profiler will tell you how much memory your program is using at each point in execution.

You can also reduce the amount of memory that your program uses by:

* Using data structures that are more memory efficient
* Avoiding unnecessary memory allocations
* Releasing memory that is no longer needed

## 5. Using too much CPU time

Another common problem that developers encounter is using too much CPU time. This can lead to the program running slowly or even crashing.

To avoid this problem, it is important to be aware of the amount of CPU time that your program is using. You can do this by using a CPU profiler. A CPU profiler will tell you how much CPU time your program is using at each point in execution.

You can also reduce the amount of CPU time that your program uses by:

* Using algorithms that are more efficient
* Parallelizing your code
* Avoiding unnecessary computations

## 6. Not using the right tools

Finally, developers often encounter problems because they are not using the right tools for the job. This can lead to inefficient code, incorrect results, or even crashes.

To avoid this problem, it is important to choose the right tools for the problem you are trying to solve. There are many different tools available, so it is important to do some research to find the ones that are best suited for your needs.

Some of the most common tools that developers use include:

* Compilers
* Debuggers
* IDEs
* Unit testing frameworks
* Performance testing frameworks

By using the right tools, developers can avoid many of the problems that can occur when solving problems.

3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, if the algorithm does not take into account all of the constraints of the problem, the program will not produce the correct output.
4. **Incorrect data**. The data used to test the program may be incorrect. For example, if the data contains a flag that is located inside the quadcopter starting point, the program will not be able to find a path that surrounds the flag.
5. **Incorrect implementation**. The program may be implemented incorrectly. For example, if the program uses incorrect variable names or does not use the correct data types, the program will not work correctly.
6. **Incorrect debugging**. The program may not be debugged correctly. For example, if the program does not print the correct output, the programmer may not be able to identify the bug.
7. **Incorrect testing**. The program may not be tested correctly. For example, if the program is only tested on a small number of test cases, the programmer may not be able to identify all of the bugs.
8. **Incorrect documentation**. The program may not be documented correctly. For example, if the program does not include a description of the algorithm or the input/output format, the programmer may not be able to use the program correctly.

CODEFORCES 908_B. New Year and Buggy Bot

Pain points:
**1. The robot may not be able to reach the exit**

The robot can only move up, left, right, or down. If there is an obstacle in the way, the robot will crash and break down. So the robot may not be able to reach the exit if there are too many obstacles in the way.

**2. The robot may not be able to follow the instructions**

The robot will follow the instructions according to the given string in order. If an instruction would lead the robot to go off the edge of the maze or hit an obstacle, the robot will crash and break down. So the robot may not be able to follow the instructions if the instructions are not valid.

**3. The robot may not be able to map the digits to distinct directions**

The robot will map distinct digits to distinct directions. If there are two digits that map to the same direction, the robot will not be able to follow the instructions. So the robot may not be able to map the digits to distinct directions if the instructions are not valid.

**4. The robot may not be able to find a valid mapping of digits to directions**

Even if the robot can reach the exit and follow the instructions, it may not be able to find a valid mapping of digits to directions. This is because there are many possible mappings of digits to directions, and the robot may not be able to find one that works.

**5. The robot may not be able to reach the exit in the given number of steps**

The robot will follow the instructions according to the given string in order. If the instructions are too long, the robot may not be able to reach the exit in time. So the robot may not be able to reach the exit in the given number of steps.

**6. The robot may not be able to reach the exit in the given number of moves**

The robot can only move up, left, right, or down. If the instructions require the robot to move more than one step in a single direction, the robot will not be able to reach the exit. So the robot may not be able to reach the exit in the given number of moves.

CODEFORCES 92_A. Chips

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain two integers, `n` and `m`. However, a developer may accidentally input a string or a number that is not an integer. This will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of chips the presenter will get.** The presenter will get the number of chips that is equal to the remainder of `m` divided by `n`. However, a developer may accidentally divide `m` by `n` instead of finding the remainder. This will cause the program to output an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect use of the modulus operator.** The modulus operator (`%`) returns the remainder of a division operation. However, a developer may accidentally use the modulus operator to perform an arithmetic operation. This will cause the program to output an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect use of the `break` statement.** The `break` statement is used to terminate a loop early. However, a developer may accidentally use the `break` statement outside of a loop. This will cause the program to terminate unexpectedly.
5. **Incorrect use of the `continue` statement.** The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop. However, a developer may accidentally use the `continue` statement outside of a loop. This will cause the program to skip some of the iterations of the loop.
6. **Incorrect use of the `for` loop.** The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence of elements. However, a developer may accidentally use the `for` loop to iterate over a non-existent sequence of elements. This will cause the program to crash.
7. **Incorrect use of the `while` loop.** The `while` loop is used to iterate over a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. However, a developer may accidentally use the `while` loop to iterate over a block of code that will never terminate. This will cause the program to run indefinitely.
8. **Incorrect use of the `if` statement.** The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true. However, a developer may accidentally use the `if` statement to execute a block of code that will always be true. This will cause the program to execute the block of code unnecessarily.
9. **Incorrect use of the `else` statement.** The `else` statement is used to execute a block of code if the `if` statement is not true. However, a developer may accidentally use the `else` statement to execute a block of code that will never be executed. This will cause the program to skip the block of code unnecessarily.
10. **Incorrect use of the `switch` statement.** The `switch` statement is used to execute a block of code based on the value of a variable. However, a developer may accidentally use the `switch` statement with a variable that does not have a valid value. This will cause the program to crash.

CODEFORCES 983_A. Finite or not?

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific. Make sure that you are reading the input correctly and that you are not missing any of the required fields.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output for this problem should be either "Finite" or "Infinite". Make sure that you are not printing any extra characters or that you are not omitting any of the required words.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the fraction.** The fraction is calculated by dividing the numerator by the denominator. Make sure that you are doing this correctly and that you are not making any mistakes in your arithmetic.
4. **Incorrect handling of special cases.** There are a few special cases that you need to be aware of when solving this problem. For example, if the denominator is zero, the fraction is undefined. Make sure that you are handling these special cases correctly.
5. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.** Floating-point numbers are often used to represent fractions, but they can be inaccurate. Make sure that you are using floating-point numbers carefully and that you are not rounding them to the wrong number of decimal places.
6. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) is often used to calculate the remainder of a division. Make sure that you are using the modulo operator correctly and that you are not getting confused with the division operator (/).

HACKEREARTH a-new-maximizing-problem-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modular arithmetic.** When computing the product of two integers, it is important to make sure that the result is modulo a prime number. Otherwise, the result may overflow and produce an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. This means that if you divide two integers and then take the modulo of the result, you will get the same answer as if you had simply divided the smaller integer by the larger integer. This can lead to errors if you are not careful.
3. **Incorrect use of the factorial function.** The factorial function (n!) returns the product of all the integers from 1 to n. This function can be very computationally expensive, so it is important to use it carefully.
4. **Incorrect use of the sorting algorithm.** The sorting algorithm sorts a list of elements in ascending order. This can be a very time-consuming operation, so it is important to use it only when necessary.
5. **Incorrect use of the binary search algorithm.** The binary search algorithm searches for a particular element in a sorted list. This algorithm can be very efficient, but it is important to use it correctly.

Title:
HACKEREARTH birthday-party-6

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The developer may incorrectly type the variable type, which could lead to errors. For example, if the developer defines a variable as an integer but then attempts to assign a string to it, an error will occur.
2. **Incorrect operator:** The developer may use the wrong operator, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, if the developer attempts to divide two integers using the `/` operator, the result will be a float.
3. **Off-by-one error:** The developer may forget to account for the first or last element in a list or array, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, if the developer is counting the number of elements in a list, they may forget to include the first element.
4. **Index out of bounds:** The developer may attempt to access an element in a list or array that is out of bounds, which will cause an error. For example, if the developer attempts to access the fifth element in a list that only has four elements, an error will occur.
5. **Null pointer exception:** The developer may attempt to access a null pointer, which will cause an error. For example, if the developer attempts to call a method on a null object, an error will occur.
6. **Arithmetic overflow:** The developer may perform an arithmetic operation that results in an overflow, which will cause an error. For example, if the developer attempts to divide a number by zero, an arithmetic overflow will occur.
7. **Stack overflow:** The developer may create a recursive function that calls itself too many times, which will cause a stack overflow. For example, if the developer creates a recursive function that calls itself twice, a stack overflow will occur.
8. **Memory leak:** The developer may create a memory leak, which will cause the program to use more and more memory until it eventually crashes. For example, if the developer creates a new object but never deletes it, a memory leak will occur.

HACKEREARTH crazy-matrix

Pain points:
**1. The input matrix may not be a square matrix.**

The problem statement states that the input matrix is a square matrix. However, the input may not be a square matrix. For example, the input `[0, 0, 1]` is not a square matrix.

**2. The input matrix may not contain only 0, 1, or 2.**

The problem statement states that the input matrix contains only 0, 1, or 2. However, the input may contain other characters. For example, the input `['a', 'b', 'c']` does not contain only 0, 1, or 2.

**3. The input matrix may not be a valid matrix.**

The problem statement states that the input matrix is a valid matrix. However, the input may not be a valid matrix. For example, the input `[[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 2], [2, 2, 1]]` is not a valid matrix because the first row and the second row are not the same length.

**4. The output may not be correct.**

The problem statement states that the output should be 0, 1, 2, or AMBIGUOUS. However, the output may not be correct. For example, the output `['a', 'b', 'c']` is not a valid output.

**5. The code may not be efficient.**

The code may not be efficient. For example, the code may take a long time to run on a large input matrix.

count = 0
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] == 1:
        count += 1
print(count)
```

2. **Off-by-one errors**. For example, using `i - 1` instead of `i` in the following code:

```
n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] == 1:
        arr[i - 1] = 0
        arr[i + 1] = 0
for i in range(n):
    print(arr[i], end=" ")
```

3. **Incorrect logic**. For example, using `arr[i]` instead of `arr[i - 1]` in the following code:

```
n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] == 1:
        arr[i - 1] = 0
        arr[i + 1] = 0
for i in range(n):
    print(arr[i], end=" ")
```

4. **Using the wrong data type**. For example, using `int` instead of `str` in the following code:

```
n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] == 1:
        arr[i - 1] = 0

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly specified. For example, the input format should specify the number of test cases, the number of children, and the number of sweets each child has.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correctly specified. For example, the output format should specify the final number of sweets each kid has.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic used to solve the problem is incorrect. For example, the logic does not correctly account for all possible cases.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. The code is not correctly implemented. For example, the code contains syntax errors or logical errors.
5. **Incorrect testing**. The test cases used to test the code are not correctly specified. For example, the test cases do not test all possible cases.
6. **Incorrect debugging**. The debugging process is not correctly performed. For example, the debugger is not used to identify the source of the bug.
7. **Incorrect documentation**. The documentation is not correctly written. For example, the documentation does not provide enough information about the code.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats.

Title:
HACKEREARTH micro-and-permutations

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of edges.** The number of edges in a graph is equal to the number of pairs of vertices that are connected by an edge. For example, in the graph shown in the problem statement, there are 3 edges: (1, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 1).
2. **Not considering the direction of edges.** In a directed graph, the edges have a direction. This means that an edge from vertex A to vertex B does not imply that there is an edge from vertex B to vertex A. For example, in the graph shown in the problem statement, there is an edge from vertex 1 to vertex 2, but there is no edge from vertex 2 to vertex 1.
3. **Not considering the order of vertices in a permutation.** In a permutation, the order of the vertices matters. For example, the permutations (1, 2, 3) and (3, 2, 1) are not the same.
4. **Not considering the fact that a graph may not have any lucky permutations.** For example, the graph shown in the problem statement does not have any lucky permutations because there is no way to order the vertices such that there is an edge between each pair of consecutive vertices.
5. **Incorrectly implementing the algorithm to find the number of lucky permutations.** The algorithm to find the number of lucky permutations is a bit complex. It involves finding the number of cycles in the graph and then multiplying that number by the number of ways to order the vertices in each cycle.

Here are some tips to avoid these problems:

* Make sure you understand the definition of a lucky permutation.
* Make sure you know how to count the number of edges in a graph.
* Make sure you know how to consider the direction of edges in a graph.
* Make sure you know how to order the vertices in a permutation.
* Make sure you know how to find the number of cycles in a graph.
* Make sure you correctly implement the algorithm to find the number of lucky permutations.

Title:
HACKEREARTH remains

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect assumptions**

When solving a problem, it is important to make sure that you understand the problem correctly. One common mistake is to make incorrect assumptions about the input or output. For example, in this problem, you might assume that the input will always be valid. However, the input could contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers that are too large. It is important to check for invalid input and handle it appropriately.

**2. Using incorrect data structures**

Another common mistake is to use the wrong data structure to solve a problem. For example, in this problem, you might try to use a list to store the heights of the buildings. However, this would not be a good choice, because lists are not efficient for storing large amounts of data. A better choice would be to use a heap or a hash table.

**3. Using incorrect algorithms**

Finally, you might also make a mistake by using the wrong algorithm to solve a problem. For example, in this problem, you might try to solve the problem using a brute-force algorithm. However, this would be very inefficient, because it would require you to check every possible combination of heights for the buildings. A better choice would be to use a dynamic programming algorithm.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

It is also important to make sure that you handle edge cases correctly. For example, in this problem, you might need to handle the case where the number of buildings is 1 or 2. You also might need to handle the case where the heights of the buildings are equal.

**5. Not testing your code**

Finally, it is important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. You should test your code with a variety of different inputs, including invalid inputs. You should also test your code with different data structures and algorithms.
Test inputs:

This is because the code uses a list to store the heights of the buildings. However, lists are not efficient for storing large amounts of data. A better choice would be to use a heap or a hash table.

2. ```

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the number of vertices `N` and the number of edges `M` are not separated by a space.
2. **Malformed input data**. The input data contains invalid values, such as negative numbers or numbers that are too large.
3. **Incorrect implementation**. The algorithm for finding strongly connected components is incorrect. This can lead to incorrect results, such as components being missed or merged together incorrectly.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The algorithm may miss a vertex or include a vertex twice. This can lead to incorrect results, such as components being missed or merged together incorrectly.
5. **Memory errors**. The algorithm may allocate too much memory or not enough memory. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
6. **Timeout errors**. The algorithm may take too long to run. This can lead to the program crashing or the user getting impatient and quitting.
7. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed. For example, the number of components is not printed on the first line, or the components are not listed in topological order.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the algorithm thoroughly with a variety of input data.

Title:
ATCODER p02695 AtCoder Beginner Contest 165 - Many Requirements

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect variable types**. The program may not be correctly assigning the input values to the correct variables. For example, the input values may be strings, but the program may be expecting them to be integers. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program may contain logical errors, such as using the wrong variable or performing the wrong operation. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The program may be off by one when performing calculations, such as when computing the index of an element in an array. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
5. **Infinite loops**. The program may enter an infinite loop if it is not properly checking for termination conditions. This can cause the program to crash or consume all available resources.
6. **Memory leaks**. The program may not be properly freeing memory that it has allocated. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may contain security vulnerabilities, such as allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data. This can allow attackers to compromise the system or steal data.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design and test your program. You should also use a debugger to help you find and fix errors.
Test inputs:
```
# 2 ≤ N ≤ 10
# 1 ≤ M ≤ 10
# 1 ≤ Q ≤ 50
# 1 ≤ a_i < b_i ≤ N ( i = 1, 2, ..., Q )
# 0 ≤ c_i ≤ M - 1 ( i = 1, 2, ..., Q )
# (a_i, b_i, c_i) ≠ (a_j, b_j, c_j) (where i ≠ j)
# 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^5 ( i = 1, 2, ..., Q )

N, M, Q = map(int, input().split())
a, b, c, d = [], [], [], []
for i in range(Q):
    a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i = map(int, input().split())
    a.append(a_i)

Title:
ATCODER p02824 AtCoder Grand Contest 041 - Voting Judges

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect variable types**

The problem states that `N` is an integer, but the code below uses `int` instead of `long long`. This could lead to incorrect results if `N` is large.

```
int N, M, V, P;
```

**2. Incorrect variable initialization**

The problem states that `P` is an integer less than `N`, but the code below initializes `P` to `N`. This could lead to incorrect results if `N` is less than `P`.

```
int N, M, V, P = N;
```

**3. Incorrect calculation of the number of problems that have a chance to be chosen**

The problem states that the number of problems that have a chance to be chosen is `max(P - V + 1, 0)`. However, the code below calculates the number of problems that have a chance to be chosen as `max(P - V, 0)`. This could lead to incorrect results if `V` is greater than `P`.

```
int ans = max(P - V, 0);
```

**4. Incorrect output formatting**

The problem states that the output should be a single integer, but the code below prints the output as a string. This could lead to the submission being marked as incorrect.

```
cout << ans << endl;
```

**5. Missing error handling**

The problem does not specify what should happen if the input is invalid. The code below does not handle invalid input, and will likely crash if the input is invalid.

```
cin >> N >> M >> V >> P;
```

Title:
ATCODER p02960 AtCoder Beginner Contest 135 - Digits Parade

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulo operator**. When using modulo operator, it is important to make sure that the modulus is greater than the dividend. For example, `10 % 5` will return `0`, which is incorrect. The correct way to do this is to use `(10 % 5) + 5`, which will return `5`.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. When working with modulo arithmetic, it is important to be careful about off-by-one errors. For example, `(n + 1) % m` is not always the same as `(n % m) + 1`. The correct way to do this is to use `(n + m - 1) % m`.
3. **Incorrect use of bitmasks**. Bitmasks can be a powerful tool for solving problems involving bitwise operations, but it is important to use them correctly. For example, the following code will not work as intended:

```
int n = 0b10101010;
int m = 0b01010101;
int result = n & m;
```

This code will set `result` to `0b00000000`, which is incorrect. The correct way to do this is to use the following code:

```
int n = 0b10101010;
int m = 0b01010101;
int result = n ^ m;
```

This code will set `result` to `0b11111111`, which is the correct answer.
4. **Incorrect use of array indices**. When working with arrays, it is important to be careful about array indices. For example, the following code will cause a runtime error:

```
int arr[10];
arr[10] = 10;
```

This code will try to access the 11th element of the array, which does not exist. The correct way to do this is to use the following code:

```
int arr[10];
arr[9] = 10;
```

This code will set the 10th element of the array to 10, which is the correct behavior.
5. **Incorrect use of pointers**. Pointers can be a powerful tool for solving problems involving memory management, but it is important to use them correctly. For example, the following code will cause a runtime error:

```
int *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));
*ptr = 10;
free(ptr);
*ptr = 20;
```

This code will try to free the memory that has already been freed. The correct way to do this is to use the following code:

```
int *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));
*ptr = 10;
free(ptr);
ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));
*ptr = 20;
```

This code will first free the memory that was previously allocated, and then allocate new memory and assign the value 20 to it.

Title:
ATCODER p03096 AtCoder Grand Contest 031 - Reversi

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input specifies that the number of stones is at most 2 * 10^5, but the code uses an integer to store the number of stones. This can lead to overflow errors.

**2. Not handling the case where all stones are the same color**

The problem states that Snuke can choose two stones painted in the same color. If all stones are the same color, then Snuke cannot perform any operations. The code should handle this case by returning 1.

**3. Not using the modulo operator correctly**

The problem states that the output should be modulo 10^9+7. The code should use the modulo operator to ensure that the output is correct.

**4. Not using a fast enough algorithm**

The problem can be solved in O(N) time using a dynamic programming approach. The code should use a fast enough algorithm to ensure that it runs in time on large inputs.

**5. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code to ensure that it is correct. The code should be tested on a variety of inputs, including inputs that are small, large, and have special properties.

Title:
ATCODER p03395 AtCoder Grand Contest 022 - Remainder Game

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input is a list of integers, so we need to use the `int` data type to store the values. If we use the `str` data type instead, we will get a `ValueError` when we try to perform arithmetic operations on the values.

**2. Not handling edge cases**

The problem states that `0 <= a_i, b_i <= 50`. If we don't handle this case, our code will break when we try to divide a value by 0.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the minimum cost required to turn the original sequence into `b_1, b_2, ..., b_N`. One possible algorithm is to try all possible values of `k` and choose the one that minimizes the cost. However, this algorithm is very inefficient. A better algorithm is to use dynamic programming.

**4. Not using the right data structures**

The problem asks us to find the minimum cost required to turn the original sequence into `b_1, b_2, ..., b_N`. We can use a `dictionary` to store the minimum cost for each possible value of `k`. This will allow us to quickly find the minimum cost without having to recompute it for each value of `k`.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it to the judge. This will help you catch any bugs that you may have missed. You can test your code by using a few different input examples.

Title:
ATCODER p03559 AtCoder Regular Contest 084 - Snuke Festival

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect comparison**

In the code below, the author compares `A[i] < B[i]` and `B[i] < C[i]`. However, this is incorrect because `A[i]` and `B[i]` can be equal.

```
for i in range(n):
    if A[i] < B[i] and B[i] < C[i]:
        count += 1
```

The correct comparison should be `A[i] <= B[i]` and `B[i] <= C[i]`.

**2. Off-by-one error**

In the code below, the author uses `i + 1` instead of `i` in the `for` loop condition. This causes the author to miss the last element in the array.

```
for i in range(n - 1):
    if A[i] < B[i] and B[i] < C[i]:
        count += 1
```

The correct code should be:

```
for i in range(n):
    if A[i] < B[i] and B[i] < C[i]:
        count += 1
```

**3. Using the wrong data type**

In the code below, the author uses `int` to store the size of the altars. However, this can cause overflow errors if the size of the altars is large.

```
n = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))
B = list(map(int, input().split()))
C = list(map(int, input().split()))

count = 0
for i in range(n):
    if A[i] < B[i] and B[i] < C[i]:
        count += 1

print(count)
```

The correct data type to use is `long`.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

The code below does not handle the edge case where `n == 0`. In this case, the author should print `0` instead of trying to access the elements of the arrays.

```
n = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))
B = list(map(int, input().split()))
C = list(map(int, input().split()))

count = 0
for i in range(n):
    if A[i] < B[i] and B[i] < C[i]:
        count += 1

print(count)
```

The correct code should be:

```
n = int(input())
if n == 0:
    print(0)
else:
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    C = list(map(int, input().split()))

    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if A[i] < B[i] and B[i] < C[i]:
            count += 1

Title:
ATCODER p03713 AtCoder Beginner Contest 062 - Chocolate Bar

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum possible value.** The developer may incorrectly calculate the minimum possible value by not taking into account all possible ways to divide the bar into three pieces. For example, if the bar is 3 blocks high and 5 blocks wide, the developer may incorrectly calculate the minimum possible value as 0, when the actual minimum possible value is 1.
2. **Incorrect use of data types.** The developer may use the wrong data types to store the values of H, W, and S_{max} - S_{min}. This can lead to errors when the values are large or small. For example, if the values of H and W are both 100000, the developer may incorrectly use integers to store these values, which could lead to overflow errors.
3. **Incorrect error handling.** The developer may not handle errors correctly. For example, if the input values are not valid, the developer may not print an error message or terminate the program.
4. **Incorrect code formatting.** The developer's code may be difficult to read and understand, which can make it more difficult to find and fix bugs.
5. **Incorrect use of comments.** The developer's comments may not be helpful or may even be misleading. This can make it more difficult to understand the code.
6. **Incorrect use of unit tests.** The developer's unit tests may not be comprehensive or may not test the code in all possible ways. This can lead to bugs that are not caught until the code is deployed in production.
7. **Incorrect use of continuous integration.** The developer's continuous integration (CI) system may not be configured correctly or may not be used effectively. This can lead to bugs that are not caught until the code is merged into the master branch.
8. **Incorrect use of source control.** The developer's source control system may not be used correctly. This can lead to merge conflicts and other problems.
9. **Incorrect use of version control.** The developer's version control system may not be used correctly. This can lead to problems when tracking changes to the code.
10. **Incorrect use of code review.** The developer's code may not be reviewed by other developers before it is merged into the master branch. This can lead to bugs that are not caught until the code is deployed in production.

AIZU p00117 A reward for a Carpenter

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the number of towns is n, then each town is identified by an integer from 1 to n. However, if the input contains a town number that is not in the range of 1 to n, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong data type, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program may crash.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The program may accidentally miss or add one element when iterating over a list or array. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The program may contain logical errors, such as using the wrong variable or making a wrong assumption. This can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Infinite loop**. The program may enter an infinite loop, which will cause it to stop responding. This can happen if the program contains a bug that prevents it from exiting the loop.
6. **Memory leak**. The program may allocate memory that it does not free, which can eventually lead to a memory leak. This can cause the program to slow down or crash.

## 1. Incorrect input format

The input format is not correctly parsed. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

## 2. Incorrect algorithm

The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. This can also cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

## 3. Off-by-one errors

Off-by-one errors are common in programming, and can cause the program to produce incorrect output. For example, if you are counting the number of elements in an array, you may accidentally forget to include the first or last element.

## 4. Memory leaks

Memory leaks occur when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

## 5. Race conditions

Race conditions occur when two or more parts of a program access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output or crash.

## 6. Deadlocks

Deadlocks occur when two or more processes are waiting for each other to release a resource, and neither one can do so. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely.

## 7. Security vulnerabilities

Security vulnerabilities can occur when a program is not properly secured. This can allow attackers to gain access to the program and steal data or damage the system.

## 8. Other bugs

There are many other possible bugs that can occur in a program. These include typos, logic errors, and compiler errors. It is important to be aware of these potential problems and to take steps to avoid them.

Title:
AIZU p01169 Turn Polygons

Pain points:
360.0000000
 0.0000000
**1. Possible bugs:**

* The input data may be malformed. For example, it may contain invalid characters, or it may not have the correct number of lines.
* The input data may not be consistent. For example, the number of vertices in the equipment polygon may not match the number of vertices in the patient polygon.
* The input data may not be within the specified range. For example, the coordinates of a vertex may be outside the range of [-1000, 1000].
* The algorithm may not be correct. For example, it may not find the correct maximum rotation angle.

**2. Possible problems:**

* The algorithm may be inefficient. For example, it may take a long time to run on large input data sets.
* The algorithm may use too much memory. For example, it may need to store all of the vertices of the equipment and patient polygons in memory.
* The algorithm may not be able to handle all possible input data sets. For example, it may not be able to handle input data sets with invalid characters or with inconsistent data.

**3. Solutions:**

* To avoid malformed input data, the program can check the input data for invalid characters and for the correct number of lines.
* To avoid inconsistent input data, the program can check that the number of vertices in the equipment polygon matches the number of vertices in the patient polygon.
* To avoid input data that is outside the specified range, the program can check that the coordinates of each vertex are within the range of [-1000, 1000].
* To ensure that the algorithm is correct, the program can be tested on a variety of input data sets.
* To improve the efficiency of the algorithm, the program can use data structures and algorithms that are designed for speed.
* To reduce the memory usage of the algorithm, the program can avoid storing unnecessary data in memory.
* To handle all possible input data sets, the program can be designed to be robust to errors.

Title:
AIZU p01305 Card Game

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is very specific. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to process the input correctly and will output incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect logic**

The logic of the program must be correct in order to output the correct results. A common mistake is to forget to take into account all possible cases. For example, in the problem above, the program must consider all possible combinations of cards that Gates and Jackie could have in their hands.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that can occur when programming. This type of error occurs when a programmer miscounts by one, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, in the problem above, the program could miscount the number of cards in Gates and Jackie's hands, which would lead to incorrect results.

**4. Floating-point errors**

Floating-point errors can occur when a program performs calculations with floating-point numbers. These errors can occur due to rounding errors, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, in the problem above, the program could round the probability of Gates winning to the wrong number of decimal places, which would lead to an incorrect result.

**5. Memory errors**

Memory errors can occur when a program allocates too much or too little memory. These errors can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results. For example, in the problem above, the program could allocate too much memory for the cards in Gates and Jackie's hands, which could lead to the program crashing.

Title:
AIZU p01634 Register Phase

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be a string representing the password. If the input is not a string, the program will not work correctly.
2. **Incorrect length**. The password string must be between 1 and 20 characters. If the password string is not within this range, the program will not work correctly.
3. **Invalid characters**. The password string can only contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers. If the password string contains any other characters, the program will not work correctly.
4. **Incorrect number of digits**. The password string must contain at least one digit. If the password string does not contain any digits, the program will not work correctly.
5. **Incorrect number of uppercase letters**. The password string must contain at least one uppercase letter. If the password string does not contain any uppercase letters, the program will not work correctly.
6. **Incorrect number of lowercase letters**. The password string must contain at least one lowercase letter. If the password string does not contain any lowercase letters, the program will not work correctly.

By following these guidelines, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
AIZU p01786 Proportional Representation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The most important bug to avoid is an incorrect implementation of the algorithm. This could result in the incorrect calculation of the seats allocated to each party, which could lead to unfair representation.
2. **Incorrect input data.** Another common bug is incorrect input data. This could include invalid party names, invalid vote counts, or missing data. It is important to check the input data carefully to ensure that it is valid.
3. **Insufficient memory.** The algorithm for proportional representation can be computationally intensive, so it is important to ensure that there is sufficient memory available to run the algorithm. If there is not enough memory, the algorithm may crash or produce incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The output of the algorithm should be in the correct format. This includes the correct number of seats for each party, as well as the correct names of the parties. If the output format is incorrect, it may be difficult to interpret the results of the algorithm.
5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that could occur when solving this problem. These include bugs in the user interface, bugs in the error handling, and bugs in the unit tests. It is important to test the algorithm thoroughly to identify and fix any bugs.

Title:
AIZU p02059 Revenge of UMG

Pain points:
1. The input format is not clear. Is it a string with 'U', 'M', 'G', and '?'? Or is it a list of strings?
2. The output format is not clear. Do we need to round the answer to the nearest integer?
3. The problem is not clear. What does "the UMG number" mean?
4. The example input is not clear. Is the first '?' in the string the first character of the string?
5. The example output is not clear. Is the output 3 an integer or a float?

Here are some possible solutions to these problems:

1. The input format can be clarified by stating that the input is a string with 'U', 'M', 'G', and '?'.
2. The output format can be clarified by stating that the output should be rounded to the nearest integer.
3. The problem can be clarified by stating that the UMG number is the number of triples (i, j, k) such that 1 <= i < j < k <= |S|, j - i = k - j, and Si = 'U', Sj = 'M', Sk = 'G'.
4. The example input can be clarified by stating that the first '?' in the string is the first character of the string.
5. The example output can be clarified by stating that the output 3 is an integer.

Title:
AIZU p02201 Ninja E869120

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is "$ N $
$ S_1 $
$ S_2 $
$ S_3 $
$\dots$
$ S_N $", where $ N $ is an integer and $ S_i $ is a string consisting of numbers and uppercase letters. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is "E869120 Please output the number of people you were split into. However, if you do not have E869120, please output \"0\".
However, insert a line break at the end.". If the output format is incorrect, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program should count the number of times the string "E869120" appears in the input. If the logic is incorrect, the program will output the wrong answer.
4. **Memory leak**. The program should not allocate any unnecessary memory. If there is a memory leak, the program will eventually crash.
5. **Security vulnerability**. The program should not allow users to input malicious code. If there is a security vulnerability, the program could be exploited by attackers.

Title:
AIZU p02355 The Smallest Window II

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The input is a list of integers, so it is tempting to use a list to store the elements of the subarray. However, this will not work because the subarray may overlap with itself. Instead, we need to use a set to store the elements of the subarray.
2. **Incorrect use of indexes.** When iterating over the input list, it is important to keep track of the current index and the previous index. This is necessary in order to check if the subarray overlaps with itself.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When computing the size of the subarray, it is important to make sure that you do not count the first element or the last element twice.
4. **Incorrect use of mathematical formulas.** The formula for computing the size of the subarray is not as simple as it might seem. It is important to be careful about the order of operations and the use of parentheses.
5. **Incorrect use of boundary conditions.** The input may contain negative integers or zero, which can cause problems if you are not careful. It is important to check for these cases and handle them appropriately.
