Title:
CODECHEF csub

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type:** The input consists of integers, so you should use `int` or `long long` to store them. Using `string` or `char` will cause problems.
2. **Off-by-one errors:** Be careful about the boundaries of your array or string. For example, if you are trying to find the length of a substring, make sure to check that `i < n` and `j < n`.
3. **Incorrect logic:** Make sure that your logic is correct. For example, if you are trying to find the number of substrings that start and end with a certain character, you need to make sure that you count each substring only once.
4. **Using inefficient algorithms:** There are more efficient ways to solve some problems than others. For example, you can use binary search to find the index of a certain element in an array, instead of using a linear search.
5. **Not handling special cases:** Make sure that you handle special cases correctly. For example, if the input is empty, you need to return 0.

Title:
CODECHEF horses

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The problem states that the skill of each horse is represented by an integer. However, if you accidentally use a floating-point type, you may get incorrect results. For example, if you use a float to represent the skill of a horse with a skill of 10, you may get a result of 9.99999999999999 instead of 10.

**2. Not sorting the horses by skill**

The problem states that you need to pick two horses for the race such that the difference in their skills is minimum. This means that you need to sort the horses by skill before you start picking them. If you don't sort the horses, you may end up picking two horses with a large difference in skill, which will not result in a close race.

**3. Picking the wrong two horses**

Once you have sorted the horses by skill, you need to pick the two horses with the smallest difference in skill. To do this, you can simply start at the beginning of the list and pick the first two horses that you find. However, this is not always the best strategy. For example, if the first two horses have a large difference in skill, you may be better off picking the third and fourth horses instead.

**4. Using a brute-force approach**

The brute-force approach to solving this problem is to simply try every possible combination of two horses and pick the combination with the smallest difference in skill. This approach is very inefficient, as it will take O(N^2) time to run.

**5. Using a greedy algorithm**

A greedy algorithm is a type of algorithm that makes locally optimal decisions at each step in order to achieve a global optimum. A greedy algorithm for solving this problem would start by picking the two horses with the smallest skill. Then, it would greedily pick the next two horses with the smallest difference in skill. This approach is much more efficient than the brute-force approach, as it will only take O(N) time to run.

**6. Using a dynamic programming approach**

A dynamic programming approach is a type of algorithm that builds up a solution to a problem by solving smaller subproblems. A dynamic programming approach for solving this problem would start by solving the problem for two horses. Then, it would use the solution to the two-horse problem to solve the problem for three horses, and so on. This approach is very efficient, as it will only take O(N) time to run.

Title:
CODECHEF resist

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modular arithmetic.** When computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers, it is important to use the modulus operator to ensure that the result is always less than the modulus. For example, if you are computing the greatest common divisor of 10 and 12 modulo 13, the correct answer is 2, not 4.
2. **Incorrect use of the Euclidean algorithm.** The Euclidean algorithm is a recursive algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers. It is important to understand the algorithm and how it works in order to avoid making mistakes.
3. **Incorrect use of the extended Euclidean algorithm.** The extended Euclidean algorithm is an extension of the Euclidean algorithm that can be used to find the multiplicative inverse of a number modulo another number. It is important to understand the algorithm and how it works in order to avoid making mistakes.
4. **Incorrect use of the Chinese remainder theorem.** The Chinese remainder theorem is a theorem that allows you to solve a system of congruences modulo different moduli. It is important to understand the theorem and how it works in order to avoid making mistakes.
5. **Incorrect use of floating-point arithmetic.** Floating-point arithmetic is notoriously imprecise, and it is important to be careful when using it to avoid introducing rounding errors.
6. **Incorrect use of bit operations.** Bit operations can be very efficient, but it is important to be careful when using them to avoid making mistakes.
7. **Incorrect use of memory management.** Memory management is a critical part of any program, and it is important to be careful when allocating and freeing memory to avoid memory leaks and other problems.
8. **Incorrect use of threading.** Threading can be a powerful tool, but it is important to be careful when using it to avoid race conditions and other problems.
9. **Incorrect use of networking.** Networking can be a complex topic, and it is important to be careful when using it to avoid security vulnerabilities and other problems.
10. **Incorrect use of databases.** Databases can be a powerful tool, but it is important to be careful when using them to avoid data corruption and other problems.

Title:
CODECHEF twodogs

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**

The input format should be `N, K` where `N` is the number of apples and `K` is the required sum. The next line should contain `N` space-separated integers `T1, T2, ..., TN` denoting the types of the apples.

**2. The output format is not correct**

The output should be a single integer describing the minimum number of seconds that Chef needs to wait till he gets the desired apples. If Chef cannot get the desired apples, then output `-1`.

**3. The algorithm is incorrect**

The algorithm should find the minimum number of seconds that Chef needs to wait till he gets the desired apples. If Chef cannot get the desired apples, then the algorithm should output `-1`.

**4. The code is not efficient**

The code should be as efficient as possible.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1017_E. The Supersonic Rocket

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input handling.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain two integers `n` and `m`, but the following code does not check that the input is valid:

```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
```

This could lead to a `ValueError` being raised if the input is not in the correct format.

2. **Incorrect output formatting.** The output format specifies that the output should be a single `YES` or `NO` answer, but the following code prints the answer in all caps:

```
print('YES')
```

This could lead to the submission being marked incorrect, even if the answer is correct.

3. **Incorrect logic.** The following code incorrectly checks whether the rocket is safe:

```
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if intersect(p1, p2):
            return False

return True
```

This code only checks whether two power sources from different engines intersect, but it does not check whether any power sources from the same engine intersect. This could lead to the submission being marked incorrect, even if the rocket is actually safe.

4. **Inefficient algorithm.** The following code uses a brute-force algorithm to check whether two power sources intersect:

```
def intersect(p1, p2):
    return (p1[0] - p2[0]) * (p1[1] - p2[1]) < 0
```

This algorithm takes `O(n^2)` time to run, where `n` is the number of power sources. A more efficient algorithm would be to use a divide-and-conquer approach.

5. **Memory leaks.** The following code does not free the memory used by the `p1` and `p2` arrays after they are no longer needed:

```
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if intersect(p1, p2):
            return False

return True
```

This could lead to the program running out of memory if it is run on a large input.

6. **Synchronization issues.** The following code does not use any synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to race conditions if multiple threads are accessing the same data:

```
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if intersect(p1, p2):
            return False

return True
```

This could lead to incorrect results being returned, or the program crashing.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1041_B. Buying a TV Set

Pain points:
**1. Overflow**

The input constraints are very large, so it is important to be careful about overflow. For example, if you are using 32-bit integers, the value of `a * b` could overflow. One way to avoid this is to use 64-bit integers.

**2. Division by zero**

The input constraints guarantee that `x / y` is not equal to zero, but it is still possible to divide by zero by accident. For example, if you are computing the number of TV sets with a given width, you could accidentally divide by `h` when `h = 0`. One way to avoid this is to check for `h == 0` before dividing.

**3. Incorrect output format**

The output should be a single integer. Make sure that your code prints the output in the correct format.

**4. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm you use to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, you might incorrectly count the number of TV sets with a given width. One way to check your algorithm is to test it on some small input values.

**5. Off-by-one errors**

It is easy to make off-by-one errors when counting the number of TV sets. For example, you might forget to include the TV sets with width `a` and height `b`. One way to avoid this is to carefully check your code for off-by-one errors.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1064_A. Make a triangle!

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input consists of three integers, so the developer should use `int` or `long` to store them. Using a smaller data type, such as `short`, could lead to incorrect results.

**2. Not considering the case where all sticks have the same length**

The problem states that the sticks have different lengths, but the developer may accidentally assume that they are all the same. This would lead to an incorrect solution.

**3. Not considering the case where one of the sticks is too short**

The problem states that the sticks must be used as the sides of a triangle, so they must all be at least 1 centimeter long. The developer should check for this condition before proceeding with the solution.

**4. Not considering the case where the triangle is impossible to form**

The problem states that the triangle must have a positive area. The developer should check for this condition before proceeding with the solution.

**5. Using an inefficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved in O(1) time, but the developer may accidentally use a more inefficient algorithm, such as a brute-force approach. This would lead to a slow solution.

CODEFORCES 1085_F. Rock-Paper-Scissors Champion

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may contain characters that are not numbers. This can lead to errors in the calculation of the number of possible champions.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of possible champions**. The number of possible champions is not always equal to the number of players who have not been eliminated from the tournament. For example, if two players who are adjacent in the row play a game and both lose, then the number of possible champions does not decrease.
3. **Incorrect handling of ties**. In the case of a tie, the losing player is determined by a coin toss. This means that the number of possible champions may not decrease even if one of the players is eliminated from the tournament.
4. **Incorrect handling of requests**. The requests may change the order of the players in the row. This means that the number of possible champions may not decrease even if one of the players is eliminated from the tournament.
5. **Incorrect handling of multiple requests**. The requests may be processed in any order. This means that the number of possible champions may not decrease even if one of the players is eliminated from the tournament.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input data and to correctly calculate the number of possible champions. It is also important to correctly handle ties and requests.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1105_D. Kilani and the Game

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is "3 3 2\n1 1\n1..\n...\n..2", the program will not correctly parse the input and will output an incorrect result.
* **Incorrect grid representation:** The grid is not correctly represented, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the grid is represented as a 2D array, the program may not correctly handle cells that are on the edge of the grid.
* **Incorrect castle expansion logic:** The castle expansion logic is not correctly implemented, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may not correctly handle cases where a castle can be expanded to multiple cells in a single round.
* **Incorrect game termination logic:** The game termination logic is not correctly implemented, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may not correctly handle cases where a player has no legal moves.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correctly implemented, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may not correctly print the number of cells controlled by each player.

CODEFORCES 1132_G. Greedy Subsequences

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format should be two integers n and k, separated by a space. For example, `6 4`.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output should be n - k + 1 integers, separated by a space. For example, `2 2 3`.

**3. Undefined behavior**

The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input is invalid. For example, if `n` is negative or `k` is greater than `n`, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

When computing the length of a greedy subsequence, it is important to make sure that the indices are correct. For example, if `k` is 4 and the input is `[1, 5, 2, 5, 3, 6]`, the longest greedy subsequence is `[1, 2, 5, 6]`, which has length 4.

**5. Memory leaks**

The program should free any memory that it allocates. If it does not, the program may eventually run out of memory and crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1175_B. Catch Overflow!

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the `for` loop.** The `for` loop iterates over a range of numbers, and the number of iterations must be a positive integer. In this problem, the number of iterations is specified by the `n` parameter. If `n` is not a positive integer, the `for` loop will not iterate over any numbers and the value of `x` will not change.
2. **Incorrect use of the `add` command.** The `add` command increments the value of `x` by 1. If `x` is already at its maximum value (2^32-1), the `add` command will cause `x` to overflow and the value of `x` will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect use of the `end` command.** The `end` command terminates the current `for` loop. If the `end` command is not used correctly, the `for` loop will not terminate and the value of `x` will not be correct.
4. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The value of `x` can overflow if the `add` command is executed too many times. If `x` overflows, the value of `x` will be incorrect.
5. **Incorrect use of the `0` parameter.** The `0` parameter is used to initialize the value of `x`. If `0` is not used correctly, the value of `x` will not be correct.

To avoid these problems, make sure to use the `for` loop, `add` command, `end` command, and `0` parameter correctly. Additionally, be aware of the possibility of overflow and take steps to prevent it from happening.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer. Make sure that you are not printing any extra characters, such as newlines or spaces.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When computing the probability of a perfect matching, it is important to make sure that you are not making any off-by-one errors. For example, if you forget to subtract 1 from the number of edges in the graph, your answer will be incorrect.

**4. Floating-point errors**

When computing the probability of a perfect matching, it is important to make sure that you are not using floating-point numbers. Floating-point numbers are not always accurate, and can lead to incorrect results.

**5. Using the wrong modulo operator**

CODEFORCES 1272_F. Two Bracket Sequences

Pain points:
**1. The input may contain invalid characters.** For example, the input `s = "(()(()(()(", t = ")"` is invalid because it contains the character `"`. The developer should check the input for invalid characters and raise an error if any are found.
2. The input may contain empty strings. For example, the input `s = "", t = ""` is valid, but it does not contain any brackets. The developer should handle empty strings correctly.
3. The input may contain unbalanced brackets. For example, the input `s = "(()", t = "())"` is invalid because it contains more opening brackets than closing brackets. The developer should handle unbalanced brackets correctly.
4. The output may be too long. For example, the output `s = "(()(()(()(", t = ")"` is valid, but it is very long. The developer should try to minimize the length of the output.
5. The output may not be unique. For example, the output `s = "(()", t = "())"` is valid, and there are many different ways to generate this output. The developer should choose one of the possible outputs and output that one.

Here are some tips for debugging your code:

* Use a debugger to step through your code and watch the values of your variables change. This can help you identify errors in your logic.
* Write unit tests to test your code. Unit tests can help you catch errors early and prevent them from causing problems in your production code.
* Ask for help from other developers. Other developers may be able to spot errors in your code that you missed.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1296_A. Array with Odd Sum

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type**

The input specifies that the array elements can be up to 2000, but the code below uses integers, which can only store values up to 2147483647. This could lead to incorrect results if the array contains an element with a value greater than 2147483647.

```
def solve(n, a):
    # Check if the sum of the array elements is even
    if sum(a) % 2 == 0:
        return "NO"

    # Iterate over all pairs of indices
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            # Swap the elements at indices i and j
            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]

            # Check if the sum of the array elements is now odd
            if sum(a) % 2 == 1:
                return "YES"

    return "NO"
```

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm below does not work correctly because it does not consider the possibility that the array elements could be negative. This could lead to incorrect results if the array contains any negative elements.

```
def solve(n, a):
    # Check if the sum of the array elements is even
    if sum(a) % 2 == 0:
        return "NO"

    # Iterate over all pairs of indices
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            # Swap the elements at indices i and j
            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]

            # Check if the sum of the array elements is now odd
            if sum(a) % 2 == 1:
                return "YES"

    return "NO"
```

**3. Not handling edge cases correctly**

The algorithm below does not handle the edge case where the array is empty correctly. This could lead to incorrect results if the input contains an empty array.

```
def solve(n, a):
    # Check if the array is empty
    if n == 0:
        return "NO"

    # Check if the sum of the array elements is even
    if sum(a) % 2 == 0:
        return "NO"

    # Iterate over all pairs of indices
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            # Swap the elements at indices i and j
            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]

            # Check if the sum of the array elements is now odd
            if sum(a) % 2 == 1:
                return "YES"

    return "NO"
```

**4. Using inefficient algorithms**

The algorithm below is inefficient because it uses a nested loop to iterate over all pairs of indices. This could lead to a significant performance penalty if the array is large.

```
def solve(n, a):
    # Check if the sum of the array elements is even
    if sum(a) % 2 == 0:
        return "NO"

    # Iterate over all pairs of indices
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            # Swap the elements at indices i and j
            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]

            # Check if the sum of the array elements is now odd
            if sum(a) % 2 == 1:
                return "YES"

    return "NO"
```

**5. Not using the most appropriate data structures**

The algorithm below uses a list to store the array elements. This could lead to a performance penalty if the array is large. A more efficient data structure to use would be a heap.

```
def solve(n, a):
    # Check if the sum of the array elements is even
    if sum(a) % 2 == 0:
        return "NO"

    # Iterate over all pairs of indices

Title:
CODEFORCES 1338_C. Perfect Triples

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the bitwise XOR operation.** This is the most common mistake that programmers make when solving this problem. The bitwise XOR operation is performed on two integers, and the result is an integer that is equal to the bits that are different in the two input integers. For example, the bitwise XOR of the integers 0 and 1 is 1, because the only bit that is different between these two integers is the least significant bit.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the lexicographic comparison of two triples.** The lexicographic comparison of two triples is performed by comparing the first element of each triple, then the second element, and then the third element. If any of the elements are not equal, the triple with the smaller element is considered to be lexicographically smaller. For example, the triple (1, 2, 3) is lexicographically smaller than the triple (2, 1, 3) because the first element of the first triple is smaller than the first element of the second triple.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm for finding the n-th element of the sequence s.** The algorithm for finding the n-th element of the sequence s is a simple recursive algorithm. The algorithm starts by finding the smallest triple of positive integers (a, b, c) such that a ⊕ b ⊕ c = 0 and a, b, and c are not in s. The algorithm then adds a, b, and c to s and returns a.
4. **Incorrect handling of overflows.** The algorithm for finding the n-th element of the sequence s can potentially overflow if n is too large. To avoid this problem, the algorithm should be modified to check for overflows and return an error if an overflow occurs.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. Use a reliable library implementation of the bitwise XOR operation.
2. Use a reliable library implementation of the lexicographic comparison of two triples.
3. Carefully verify the correctness of your implementation of the algorithm for finding the n-th element of the sequence s.
4. Test your code with a variety of input values, including values that are likely to cause overflows.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is not very strict. It is possible to enter a single integer instead of a list of integers. This can lead to a segmentation fault or other errors.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format for this problem is also not very strict. It is possible to print a single integer instead of a list of integers. This can lead to a compilation error or other errors.
3. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm used to solve this problem must be correct. If the algorithm is incorrect, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect data.** The data used to test the algorithm must be correct. If the data is incorrect, the algorithm may not produce the correct output.
5. **Incorrect implementation.** The implementation of the algorithm must be correct. If the implementation is incorrect, the algorithm may not produce the correct output.

CODEFORCES 1380_C. Create The Teams

Pain points:
**1. Sorting the array in ascending order**

This is a common mistake that many people make when solving this problem. Sorting the array in ascending order will not give you the correct answer, because you need to find the maximum number of teams that you can assemble, not the minimum number.

**2. Using a brute-force approach**

A brute-force approach to this problem would be to try every possible combination of teams and see which one gives you the maximum number of teams. This approach is very inefficient and will not work for large inputs.

**3. Not taking into account the restriction on the minimum skill of a team**

The restriction on the minimum skill of a team is very important. If you ignore this restriction, you will not be able to find the correct answer.

**4. Using the wrong formula to calculate the number of teams**

The formula for calculating the number of teams is not as simple as you might think. You need to take into account the fact that some programmers may be left without a team.

**5. Making a mistake in your implementation**

Even if you understand the problem and have a good solution, you can still make a mistake in your implementation. It is important to carefully check your code for errors before submitting it.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

* Use a greedy algorithm to solve this problem. A greedy algorithm will find a solution that is not necessarily optimal, but it will be close to optimal.
* Use a binary search to find the maximum number of teams that you can assemble. A binary search will allow you to find the answer efficiently, even for large inputs.
* Take into account the restriction on the minimum skill of a team. This is the most important part of the problem.
* Use the correct formula to calculate the number of teams.
* Carefully check your code for errors.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs that developers encounter when solving this problem.

CODEFORCES 1400_C. Binary String Reconstruction

Pain points:
```
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement is not very clear, so it is important to read it carefully and make sure you understand what it is asking you to do. In particular, it is important to understand that the input string `s` is not the same as the output string `w`. `s` is the string that is produced by the process, while `w` is the original string that was used to produce `s`.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for reconstructing the original string `w` is not very difficult, but it is important to make sure that you implement it correctly. In particular, you need to be careful about the edge cases, such as when `x` is equal to 0 or `n`.
3. **Incorrect handling of invalid input.** The input to the problem may contain invalid values, such as a string `s` that contains characters other than 0 and 1 or an integer `x` that is less than 1 or greater than `n`. It is important to handle these invalid inputs gracefully.
4. **Incorrect output formatting.** The output of the problem should be a binary string of length `n`, where each character is either 0 or 1. It is important to make sure that your output is formatted correctly.

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not correctly followed. For example, the input may not contain two integers n and k, or the integers may not be in the correct range.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not correctly followed. For example, the output may not contain a single integer t, or the integer t may not be in the correct range.
3. **Incorrect solution.** The solution does not achieve the desired shortcutting diameter. For example, the solution may add more than 10 * n shortcuts.
4. **Memory limit exceeded.** The solution uses too much memory. This may happen if the solution uses a large data structure or if the solution does not free up memory that is no longer needed.
5. **Time limit exceeded.** The solution takes too long to run. This may happen if the solution uses a computationally expensive algorithm or if the solution does not use efficient data structures.
6. **Incorrect edge representation.** The edges in the input graph may not be represented correctly. For example, the edges may be directed or the edges may not be unique.
7. **Incorrect graph traversal.** The solution may not correctly traverse the graph. This may happen if the solution uses an incorrect algorithm or if the solution does not handle special cases correctly.
8. **Incorrect shortcut selection.** The solution may not correctly select the shortcuts to add. This may happen if the solution does not consider all of the possible shortcuts or if the solution does not choose the best shortcuts.
9. **Incorrect path construction.** The solution may not correctly construct the good paths. This may happen if the solution does not consider all of the possible paths or if the solution does not choose the best paths.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1444_D. Rectangular Polyline

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.

### 2. Incorrect output format

The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if you forget to add a newline character at the end of each line, the output will be incorrect.

### 3. Off-by-one errors

When iterating over an array, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, if you forget to increment the index before accessing the next element, you will read the wrong element from the array.

### 4. Index out of bounds errors

When iterating over an array, it is easy to access an element that is out of bounds. For example, if you try to access the element at index n in an array of size n-1, you will get an IndexError.

### 5. Null pointer exceptions

When dereferencing a null pointer, you will get a NullPointerException. This can happen if you try to access an element of an array that has not been initialized, or if you try to call a method on a null object.

### 6. Arithmetic overflow errors

When performing arithmetic operations on large numbers, it is possible to overflow the integer data type. This can happen if you try to add two numbers that are too large, or if you try to divide a number by zero.

### 7. Floating point errors

Floating point numbers are not exact, so it is possible to get rounding errors when performing arithmetic operations on them. This can happen if you try to compare two floating point numbers that are very close to each other, or if you try to calculate the square root of a negative number.

### 8. Memory leaks

When you create an object, you are allocating memory for it on the heap. If you do not delete the object when you are finished with it, you will leak memory. This can eventually lead to a program crash.

### 9. Race conditions

A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same shared resource at the same time. This can lead to unpredictable results, or even a program crash.

### 10. Deadlocks

A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can prevent any of the threads from making progress, and eventually lead to a program crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1469_E. A Bit Similar

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be strictly followed. For example, if the input format is incorrect, the program may crash or output incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input and output should be correctly defined. For example, if the input is an integer but the program treats it as a string, the program may crash or output incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one error**. This is a common mistake that occurs when the programmer forgets to add or subtract one from a variable. For example, if the programmer wants to find the index of the first occurrence of a character in a string, but they forget to add one to the index, the program may return the wrong index.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The programmer may make a mistake in the logic of the program, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the programmer wants to sort a list of numbers, but they use the wrong sorting algorithm, the list may be sorted incorrectly.
5. **Memory leak**. This occurs when the programmer allocates memory for a variable but does not free it when the variable is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race condition**. This occurs when two or more threads try to access the same shared resource at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
7. **Deadlock**. This occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, but neither thread can release the resource because it is waiting for the other thread to release it first. This can lead to the program deadlocking and not being able to continue running.
8. **Buffer overflow**. This occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold. This can lead to the program crashing or the data being corrupted.
9. **Stack overflow**. This occurs when a program calls a function so many times that the stack overflows and the program crashes.
10. **Format string vulnerability**. This occurs when a program uses a format string that is not properly sanitized. This can lead to the program being exploited by an attacker.

Title:
CODEFORCES 172_D. Calendar Reform

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the input should be a pair of integers, but the input may contain other characters. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of sheets of paper.** The number of sheets of paper required is calculated by multiplying the number of months in each year by the number of days per month. However, the number of months in each year may not be a whole number, so the calculation must be done carefully to avoid rounding errors.
3. **Time complexity.** The program must not take longer than four seconds to run on the maximum test case. This means that the algorithm used to calculate the number of sheets of paper must be efficient.
4. **Memory usage.** The program must not use more than a certain amount of memory. This means that the algorithm used to calculate the number of sheets of paper must be implemented in a memory-efficient way.
5. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the output should be a single integer. However, the output may contain other characters. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 216_E. Martian Luck

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to put a space between the two integers in the first line, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output for this problem should be a single integer, representing the number of lucky substrings. If you output anything else, the program will not be accepted.
3. **Incorrect calculation of digital roots**. The digital root of a number is the result of repeatedly summing the digits of the number until you get a single digit. For example, the digital root of 12345 is 6, because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15, and 1 + 5 = 6. It's important to be careful when calculating digital roots, because it's easy to make a mistake.
4. **Incorrect handling of leading zeroes**. The problem states that leading zeroes are permitted in the numbers. This means that you need to be careful when handling numbers that start with a zero. For example, the number 0123 is a valid number in this problem, and its digital root is 6.
5. **Incorrect handling of substrings**. The problem states that two substrings are considered different if either i1 ≠ i2 or j1 ≠ j2. This means that you need to be careful when checking if two substrings are the same. For example, the substrings s[1... 2] and s[2... 3] are different, even though they contain the same characters.

To avoid these problems, it's important to carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand the input format, output format, and the rules for calculating digital roots and handling substrings. It's also helpful to write out a few examples before you start coding, to make sure that you understand the problem.

CODEFORCES 23_E. Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input data. For example, if the number of vertices is not a positive integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect graph representation**. The input data may represent a graph that is not a tree. For example, if the graph contains a cycle, the program will output an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect edge deletion**. The program must delete edges from the graph in a way that does not create any cycles. For example, if the program deletes an edge that is part of a cycle, the graph will no longer be a tree and the program will output an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the product of the sizes of the connected components**. The program must calculate the product of the sizes of the connected components in a way that is consistent with the definition of a tree. For example, if the program calculates the product of the sizes of all the vertices in the graph, the answer will be incorrect.
5. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when writing the output data. For example, if the output does not contain a single number, the program will crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 265_C. Escape from Stones

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly initializing the interval.** The interval should be initialized to `[0, 1]`, but some solutions initialize it to `[1, 2]` or `[0, 2]`. This will cause the solution to be incorrect.
2. **Incorrectly updating the interval.** When a stone falls, the interval should be updated to `[k - d, k]` or `[k, k + d]`, depending on whether Liss escapes to the left or to the right. Some solutions incorrectly update the interval to `[k - d, k + d]` or `[k, k + 2d]`. This will cause the solution to be incorrect.
3. **Incorrectly printing the output.** The output should be a sequence of integers, one per line, where the i-th line contains the i-th stone's number from the left. Some solutions print the output in the wrong order, or they print it as a single string instead of a sequence of lines. This will cause the solution to be incorrect.
4. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the solution may not handle invalid input correctly, or it may not be efficient enough. It is important to carefully read the problem statement and to test the solution thoroughly to ensure that it is correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 669_A. Little Artem and Presents

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly using the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. For example, 10 % 3 is 1, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1. However, some developers mistakenly use the modulo operator to check if a number is divisible by another number. For example, the following code would incorrectly check if n is divisible by 3:

```
if (n % 3 == 0):
  # n is divisible by 3
else:
  # n is not divisible by 3
```

The correct way to check if n is divisible by 3 is to use the following code:

```
if (n == 0):
  # n is divisible by 3
else:
  # n is not divisible by 3
```

2. **Using the wrong data type.** The data type of a variable determines the range of values that it can store. For example, an integer variable can store whole numbers, while a floating-point variable can store decimal numbers. When solving a problem, it is important to use the correct data type for each variable. For example, the following code would incorrectly calculate the square root of n:

```
n = int(input())
sqrt_n = n ** 0.5
```

The problem with this code is that the variable `n` is an integer, but the variable `sqrt_n` is a floating-point variable. This means that the value of `sqrt_n` will be rounded to the nearest decimal place, which could lead to an incorrect answer. The correct way to calculate the square root of n is to use the following code:

```
n = int(input())
sqrt_n = math.sqrt(n)
```

3. **Not handling edge cases.** An edge case is a situation that is not explicitly handled by the code. For example, the following code would incorrectly calculate the sum of the first n integers:

```
n = int(input())
sum = 0
for i in range(1, n + 1):
  sum += i
print(sum)
```

The problem with this code is that it does not handle the case where n is equal to 0. In this case, the loop will not iterate at all, and the value of `sum` will be 0. The correct way to calculate the sum of the first n integers is to use the following code:

```
n = int(input())
if (n == 0):
  print(0)
else:
  sum = 0
  for i in range(1, n + 1):
    sum += i
  print(sum)

Pain points:
 1. 200. 

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not always correctly specified, which can lead to errors in the program's output. For example, if the input format specifies that the integers should be separated by spaces, but the input contains integers that are not separated by spaces, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
* **Incorrect data type:** The data type of the input values may not be correctly specified, which can lead to errors in the program's output. For example, if the input values are specified as strings, but the program expects them to be integers, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic of the program may be incorrect, which can lead to errors in the program's output. For example, if the program does not correctly account for all of the possible cases, it may produce incorrect output.
* **Incorrect implementation:** The program may be incorrectly implemented, which can lead to errors in the program's output. For example, if the program uses incorrect variable names or data structures, it may produce incorrect output.
* **Incorrect testing:** The program may not be tested correctly, which can lead to errors in the program's output. For example, if the program is not tested with a variety of input values, it may not be able to handle all of the possible cases.

By avoiding these problems and bugs, you can ensure that your program correctly solves the problem.

CODEFORCES 734_F. Anton and School

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not strictly defined, but there are some common mistakes that developers make. For example, they might forget to add a newline character at the end of the output, or they might not print the output in the correct order.

**3. Using incorrect data types**

The problem statement specifies that the input and output should be integers. However, it is easy to make a mistake and use the wrong data type. For example, if you try to store a negative number in a signed integer variable, the program will crash.

**4. Using incorrect algorithms**

The problem statement asks you to find an array a that satisfies a certain condition. There are many different ways to solve this problem, but some algorithms are more efficient than others. If you use an inefficient algorithm, your program will run slowly and might not even finish in time.

**5. Not handling special cases**

The problem statement does not explicitly mention any special cases, but there are a few that you should be aware of. For example, what happens if the arrays b and c are empty? What happens if one of the arrays is all zeros? If you do not handle these special cases correctly, your program might crash or produce incorrect output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 758_F. Geometrical Progression

Pain points:
**1. Using a brute force approach**

A brute force approach would be to iterate over all possible values of the common ratio, and for each value of the common ratio, iterate over all possible values of the first term in the progression. For each possible combination of the common ratio and the first term, check if the resulting progression contains n distinct integers not less than l and not greater than r. If it does, then increment the count of distinct progressions. This approach would have a time complexity of O(n^2 * (r - l + 1)).

**2. Using a dynamic programming approach**

A dynamic programming approach would be to use a table to store the number of distinct progressions that can be formed with a given number of terms and a given range of values for the first term. The table would be indexed by the number of terms and the range of values for the first term. The value of the table at a given index would be the number of distinct progressions that can be formed with the given number of terms and the given range of values for the first term.

To fill in the table, we can start with the base case where the number of terms is 1. In this case, the number of distinct progressions that can be formed is equal to the number of values in the range of values for the first term.

For each subsequent value of the number of terms, we can iterate over all possible values of the range of values for the first term. For each possible value of the range of values for the first term, we can use the values in the table at the previous index to calculate the number of distinct progressions that can be formed with the given number of terms and the given range of values for the first term.

The time complexity of this approach would be O(n * (r - l + 1)^2).

**3. Using a mathematical approach**

A mathematical approach to this problem would be to use the following formula:

```
K = (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 2) / 2
```

where K is the number of distinct progressions that can be formed with n terms and a range of values for the first term from l to r.

This formula can be derived by considering the following:

* The first term in the progression can be any value from l to r.
* The second term in the progression can be any value from l + 1 to r + 1.
* The third term in the progression can be any value from l + 2 to r + 2.
* ...
* The nth term in the progression can be any value from l + n - 1 to r + n - 1.

Therefore, the total number of distinct progressions that can be formed is equal to the number of ways of choosing n values from the set of values from l to r + n - 1. This is equal to the binomial coefficient (r + n - 1, n).

The binomial coefficient (r + n - 1, n) can be simplified to (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 2) / 2.

**4. Common bugs**

* **Using a wrong formula**

The most common bug when solving this problem is to use the wrong formula. The correct formula is:

```
K = (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 2) / 2
```

* **Not handling the case where n = 1**

The case where n = 1 is a special case. In this case, the number of distinct progressions is equal to the number of values in the range of values for the first term.

* **Not handling the case where l = r**

The case where l = r is a special case. In this case, the number of distinct progressions is equal to 1.

* **Not handling the case where l > r**

The case where l > r is a special case. In this case, the number of distinct progressions is equal to 0.

CODEFORCES 803_C. Maximal GCD

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains two integers n and k. If we use the wrong data type to store these values, we may get unexpected results. For example, if we use `int` to store `n`, we may get an overflow error when `n` is very large.

**2. Not handling the corner cases**

The problem statement says that `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 1010`. We need to make sure that our code handles these corner cases correctly. For example, if `n = 0`, we should output `-1`.

**3. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks us to find a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers whose sum is equal to n and greatest common divisor is maximal. We can use the following algorithm to solve this problem:

1. Find the prime factorization of n.
2. For each prime factor p, let ai = p^⌈k/(p-1)⌉.
3. Output the sequence a1, a2, ..., ak.

This algorithm is correct, but it is not efficient. We can improve the efficiency by using the following algorithm:

1. Find the prime factorization of n.
2. Let a1 = p1^⌈k/(p1-1)⌉, where p1 is the smallest prime factor of n.
3. For each prime factor p > p1, let ai = ai-1 * p^⌈(k-i)/(p-1)⌉.
4. Output the sequence a1, a2, ..., ak.

This algorithm is much more efficient than the first algorithm.

**4. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it to the judge. This will help you to catch any bugs in your code. You can test your code by using the following test cases:

```
n = 6, k = 3

**Incorrect implementation of the gcd function:**

```
n = int(input())

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

ans = 0
for i in range(1, n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
        ans += gcd(i, j)
print(ans)
```

**Incorrect calculation of the shortest distance between two vertices:**

```
n = int(input())

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

ans = 0
for i in range(1, n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
        ans += min(gcd(i, j), gcd(j, i))
print(ans)
```

**Incorrect handling of cases where there is no path between two vertices:**

```
n = int(input())

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

ans = 0
for i in range(1, n):

        if gcd(i, j) == 0:
            ans += 1
print(ans)
```

**Incorrect output format:**

```
n = int(input())

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

ans = 0
for i in range(1, n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
        ans += gcd(i, j)
print(ans, end=" ")
```

**Runtime errors:**

```
n = int(input())

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

ans = 0
for i in range(1, n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
        ans += gcd(i, j)

```

**Logic errors:**

```

        ans += gcd(i, j)
print(ans - n)
```

CODEFORCES 898_D. Alarm Clock

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when parsing the input data. For example, if the input contains a space between two integers, the program may interpret them as two separate values.
2. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not take into account all of the constraints of the problem, or it may not be efficient enough.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when formatting the output data. For example, the output may not be aligned correctly, or it may contain extraneous characters.
4. **Incorrect error handling**. The program should handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input data is invalid, the program should print an error message and exit.
5. **Inefficient code**. The program should be as efficient as possible. For example, the program should avoid unnecessary calculations and memory allocations.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. The algorithm used to solve the problem should be carefully designed and tested. The output should be formatted correctly, and errors should be handled gracefully. The code should be efficient and well-written.

**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of integers. If the developer does not explicitly cast the input data to the integer type, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect index**

The game board is a circle, so the index of the next hole after the last hole is 1. The developer should be careful not to use an incorrect index when iterating over the list of holes.

**3. Off-by-one error**

The developer may accidentally add or subtract 1 from an index when iterating over the list of holes. This can lead to incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect logic**

The developer may incorrectly implement the algorithm for finding the maximum score. This can lead to incorrect results.

**5. Memory leak**

The developer may not release the memory allocated for the list of holes. This can lead to a memory leak.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or it may not contain the correct number of lines.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may not contain the correct number of lines, or it may not contain the correct values.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm may not be correct. For example, it may not find a solution to the problem, or it may find a solution that is not optimal.
4. **Memory limit exceeded**. The algorithm may use too much memory. This can happen if the algorithm uses a data structure that is too large, or if it does not free up memory that is no longer needed.
5. **Time limit exceeded**. The algorithm may take too long to run. This can happen if the algorithm is not efficient, or if it gets stuck in a loop.
6. **Compilation error**. The code may not compile. This can happen if there are syntax errors in the code, or if the compiler does not support the features that are used in the code.
7. **Runtime error**. The code may cause a runtime error. This can happen if the code accesses memory that is not allocated, or if it divides by zero.
8. **Logic error**. The code may contain a logic error. This can happen if the code does not do what it is supposed to do, or if it does something unexpected.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the algorithm thoroughly before submitting it to the judge.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input is a number, but the developer may accidentally use a string variable to store it. This will cause a type error.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The developer may forget to carry over the carry from the previous calculation. This will result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may forget to add 1 to the answer when the number of stairs is odd. This will also result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Infinite loop**. The developer may accidentally create an infinite loop in their code. This will cause the program to run forever and never terminate.
5. **Memory leak**. The developer may accidentally create a memory leak in their code. This will cause the program to use up more and more memory until it eventually crashes.

Pain points:
1. The given code is not correct. It does not print the output for the given input.
2. The code has a bug in the `for` loop. The condition `i < n` should be `i <= n`.
3. The code has a bug in the `if` statement. The condition `i == j` should be `i <= j`.
4. The code has a bug in the `return` statement. It should return `1` instead of `0`.

Here is the correct code:

```

HACKEREARTH hasan-and-trip-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain an integer `N`, but the input may contain a string instead.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the output should be a floating-point number rounded to 6 digits after the decimal point, but the output may be an integer or a string.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum possible happiness.** The maximum possible happiness is the sum of the happiness from visiting each city minus the total distance traveled. The distance traveled is the sum of the Euclidean distances between each pair of cities.
4. **Inefficient algorithm.** The naive algorithm for finding the maximum possible happiness would iterate over all possible sequences of cities and calculate the happiness for each sequence. This algorithm would be very inefficient for large values of `N`.
5. **Memory leak.** The program may not free up memory that it has allocated, which can lead to a memory leak.
6. **Security vulnerability.** The program may be vulnerable to attacks such as cross-site scripting or SQL injection.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully check the input format, output format, and algorithm for correctness. They should also use appropriate data structures and algorithms to ensure that the program is efficient and does not leak memory. Finally, they should carefully review the program for security vulnerabilities.

Title:
HACKEREARTH lovely-couple-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect logic**. The logic used to determine whether a couple is lovely or not is incorrect. For example, the couple (2, 3) is not lovely according to the logic, but it should be lovely because the LCM of 2 and 3 is 6, which has two distinct prime factors.
2. **Incorrect implementation**. The implementation of the logic may be incorrect. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
def is_lovely_couple(a, b):
  """Returns True if the couple (a, b) is lovely, False otherwise."""
  if lcm(a, b) < 2:
    return False
  else:
    return len(set(prime_factors(lcm(a, b)))) > 1
```

The problem with this code is that it does not correctly check whether the LCM of a and b has prime number of distinct prime factors. For example, the LCM of 2 and 3 is 6, which has two distinct prime factors, but the code will return False because len(set(prime_factors(6))) is 1.
3. **Incorrect input/output**. The input/output may be incorrect. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
def main():
  """Reads the input and prints the output."""
  t = int(input())
  for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if is_lovely_couple(a, b):
      print("Yes")
    else:
      print("No")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```

The problem with this code is that it does not correctly handle the case where t is 0. In this case, the code will enter an infinite loop.
4. **Runtime error**. The code may run into a runtime error. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
def main():
  """Reads the input and prints the output."""
  t = int(input())
  for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if is_lovely_couple(a, b):
      print("Yes")
    else:
      print("No")

main()
```

The problem with this code is that it will try to divide by zero when a is 0. This will cause a runtime error.
5. **Memory error**. The code may run out of memory. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
def main():
  """Reads the input and prints the output."""
  t = int(input())
  for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if is_lovely_couple(a, b):
      print("Yes")
    else:
      print("No")

main()
```

The problem with this code is that it will create a list of all the prime factors of the LCM of a and b. This list could be very large, and could cause a memory error.

ATCODER p02640 AtCoder Beginner Contest 170 - Crane and Turtle

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is given as integers, so it is important to use the correct data type when reading the input. For example, if you try to read the input as strings, you will get a ValueError.

**2. Using the wrong formula**

The problem states that there are X animals in total in the garden, and they have Y legs in total. To find the number of cranes and turtles, we need to use the following formula:

```
cranes + turtles = X
2 * cranes + 4 * turtles = Y
```

If you use the wrong formula, you will get the wrong answer.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

The problem states that the input data is guaranteed to be within the given constraints. However, it is important to handle edge cases anyway. For example, if X is 0, there are no animals in the garden, so the answer is always "No".

**4. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved in O(1) time using the following algorithm:

1. If X is even, then the answer is always "Yes".
2. If X is odd, then the answer is "No" if Y is not divisible by 2.
3. Otherwise, the answer is "Yes" if Y is divisible by 4.

This algorithm is much more efficient than the brute-force algorithm, which would check every possible combination of cranes and turtles.

Title:
ATCODER p02770 AtCoder Beginner Contest 156 - Modularness

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the input or output.**

The input and output of this problem are both integers. It is important to make sure that the data type you are using is large enough to hold the values that are being inputted or outputted. For example, if you are using an integer data type to store the value 10^9, you will get an overflow error.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm.**

The correct algorithm for solving this problem is to use a sliding window. A sliding window is a data structure that allows you to quickly access the most recent elements of a sequence. In this case, we can use a sliding window to track the values of a_j and a_{j + 1} for each j. This will allow us to quickly determine whether or not (a_j~\textrm{mod}~m_i) < (a_{j + 1}~\textrm{mod}~m_i).

**3. Making a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm.**

Once you have chosen the correct algorithm, it is important to carefully implement it. There are a number of ways that you can make mistakes in the implementation of an algorithm, such as using the wrong variable names, forgetting to initialize variables, or making a mistake in the logic of the algorithm. It is important to carefully check your work before submitting your solution.

**4. Not handling all of the test cases.**

The problem statement specifies a number of constraints on the input and output. It is important to make sure that your solution handles all of the test cases. For example, the problem statement states that the input and output are both integers. If your solution does not handle non-integer values, it will not be correct.

**5. Submitting an incorrect solution.**

Once you have implemented your solution, it is important to carefully check your work before submitting it. Make sure that you have followed the instructions in the problem statement and that your solution is correct. It is also important to make sure that you have formatted your solution correctly.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* Using an integer data type to store the value 10^9 will result in an overflow error.
* Using the wrong algorithm to solve the problem will result in an incorrect answer.
* Making a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm will also result in an incorrect answer.
* Not handling all of the test cases will result in a incorrect answer.
* Submitting an incorrect solution will result in a 0 score.

Title:
ATCODER p02905 AtCoder Grand Contest 038 - LCMs

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data is an integer sequence. If we use an incorrect data type to store the input data, we may get incorrect results. For example, if we use a `char` array to store the input data, we may get incorrect results because the `char` array can only store characters, not integers.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the sum of the least common multiples of all pairs of integers in the input sequence. A naive algorithm to solve this problem is to iterate over all pairs of integers in the input sequence and calculate the least common multiple of each pair. However, this algorithm is very inefficient because it has to calculate the least common multiple of every pair of integers in the input sequence. A more efficient algorithm is to use the following formula:

```
S = \sum_{i=0}^{N-2} \sum_{j=i+1}^{N-1} \mathrm{lcm}(A_i,A_j) = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \frac{A_i \cdot \prod_{j=1}^{i-1} (A_j-1)}{2}
```

This algorithm is much more efficient because it only has to calculate the least common multiple of each integer in the input sequence, instead of every pair of integers.

**3. Using incorrect modulo operation**

The problem asks us to compute the sum modulo 998244353. If we use an incorrect modulo operation, we may get incorrect results. For example, if we use the following modulo operation:

```
a % b = a - (a / b) * b
```

we may get incorrect results because this modulo operation does not work correctly when `a` is negative. A correct modulo operation is:

```
a % b = (a - (a / b) * b + b) % b
```

**4. Using incorrect overflow handling**

The problem asks us to compute the sum of the least common multiples of all pairs of integers in the input sequence. The sum of the least common multiples of all pairs of integers in the input sequence can be very large. If we do not handle overflow correctly, we may get incorrect results.

To handle overflow correctly, we can use the following algorithm:

```
while (a > 0 && b > 0) {
    if (a > b) {
        a %= b;
    } else {
        b %= a;
    }
}
```

This algorithm will find the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`. We can then use the following formula to compute the least common multiple of `a` and `b`:

```
\mathrm{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{\mathrm{gcd}(a, b)}
```

4. The values to be output in an evaluation query are always integers, so we ask you to print those values as integers without decimal points.
```

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the first line may not contain the number of queries, or the queries may not be in the correct format.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the values may not be integers, or the values may not be separated by a space.
* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm:** The algorithm may not be correct, or it may not be implemented efficiently. For example, the algorithm may not find the minimum value of f(x), or it may take too long to run.
* **Incorrect handling of errors:** The code may not handle errors correctly. For example, the code may crash if the input is invalid, or it may not print an error message if the output is incorrect.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and efficient.

ATCODER p03181 Educational DP Contest - Subtree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of dfs**

The dfs function should return the number of ways to paint the subtree rooted at the current vertex, not the number of ways to paint the entire tree.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the number of ways to paint the subtree**

The number of ways to paint the subtree rooted at the current vertex is not simply the product of the number of ways to paint the left subtree and the number of ways to paint the right subtree. This is because the two subtrees may share vertices, and the number of ways to paint a vertex depends on whether it is black or white.

**3. Incorrect modulo operation**

The number of ways to paint the tree is a large number, so it is important to perform the modulo operation correctly. A common mistake is to use the wrong modulus, or to use the modulus too early in the calculation.

**4. Incorrect use of the cache**

The cache is used to store the number of ways to paint the subtrees of each vertex. If the cache is not used correctly, it can lead to incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect handling of the base case**

The base case of the dfs function is when the current vertex is a leaf. In this case, the number of ways to paint the subtree is simply 2, since the vertex can be either black or white.

**6. Incorrect handling of the edge cases**

The edge cases are when the tree has no vertices, or when the tree has only one vertex. In these cases, the number of ways to paint the tree is 1, since the tree can only be painted in one way.

Title:
ATCODER p03329 AtCoder Beginner Contest 099 - Strange Bank

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly using the 6^n and 9^n patterns.** The problem states that the bank allows customers to withdraw only one of the following amounts in one operation:

* 1 yen
* 6 yen, 6^2(=36) yen, 6^3(=216) yen, ...
* 9 yen, 9^2(=81) yen, 9^3(=729) yen, ...

It is important to note that these patterns are **only** allowed for withdrawing money, and not for depositing money. This means that if you deposit money, you cannot then withdraw it in the same operation.

For example, if you deposit 6 yen, you cannot then withdraw 6 yen in the same operation. You must withdraw 1 yen, then 6 yen, then 9 yen, and so on.

2. **Not considering the case where N is divisible by both 6 and 9.** The problem states that the bank allows customers to withdraw only one of the following amounts in one operation:

* 1 yen
* 6 yen, 6^2(=36) yen, 6^3(=216) yen, ...
* 9 yen, 9^2(=81) yen, 9^3(=729) yen, ...

It is important to note that these patterns are **only** allowed for withdrawing money, and not for depositing money. This means that if you deposit money, you cannot then withdraw it in the same operation.

For example, if you deposit 18 yen, you cannot then withdraw 18 yen in the same operation. You must withdraw 6 yen, then 9 yen, and so on.

3. **Not considering the case where N is negative.** The problem states that N is an integer. This means that N cannot be negative.

For example, if N is -1, you cannot withdraw any money.

Title:
ATCODER p03486 AtCoder Beginner Contest 082 - Two Anagrams

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input strings are of type `str`, which means that they are stored as a sequence of characters. This can be problematic if you try to compare them using the `==` operator, as this will only check if the two strings have the same characters in the same order. For example, the strings `"abc"` and `"cba"` are not equal, even though they have the same characters.

To compare strings correctly, you need to use the `<` or `>` operator. This will compare the strings lexicographically, which means that they will be sorted in alphabetical order. For example, the string `"abc"` will be less than the string `"cba"`.

**2. Not handling the case where the two strings are equal**

In the problem statement, it is stated that the strings `s` and `t` may be equal. If this is the case, then the output should be `No`. However, many solutions will simply compare the strings using the `==` operator and return `Yes` if they are equal. This is incorrect, as the strings are not less than each other.

To handle this case correctly, you need to check if the strings are equal before comparing them using the `<` or `>` operator. If they are equal, then you should return `No`.

**3. Using a sorting algorithm that is not stable**

The problem statement states that the strings `s` and `t` may be equal. This means that, if you sort the strings, the order of the equal elements in the sorted array may not be the same as the order of the equal elements in the original array. This can lead to incorrect results if you are using the sorted array to compare the strings.

To avoid this problem, you should use a sorting algorithm that is stable. A stable sorting algorithm guarantees that the order of the equal elements in the sorted array will be the same as the order of the equal elements in the original array.

**4. Not handling the case where the two strings are empty**

The problem statement does not explicitly state what should happen if the two strings are empty. However, it is reasonable to assume that the output should be `Yes` in this case.

To handle this case correctly, you need to check if the strings are empty before comparing them using the `<` or `>` operator. If they are empty, then you should return `Yes`.

**5. Using a comparison function that is not consistent**

The problem statement states that the strings `s` and `t` may be equal. This means that, if you compare the strings using a comparison function, the result of the comparison may not be consistent. For example, the comparison function may return `1` if the first string is less than the second string, or it may return `-1` if the second string is less than the first string.

To avoid this problem, you should use a comparison function that is consistent. A consistent comparison function will always return the same result when comparing two equal strings.

ATCODER p03650 AtCoder Regular Contest 079 - Namori Grundy

Pain points:
1. **Wrong input format**. The input format is not correct. For example, if the number of vertices is not between 2 and 200000, or if any of the `p_i` is not between 1 and `N` or equal to `i`, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, if the algorithm does not take into account all of the constraints, it will not produce the correct output.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correct. For example, if the output does not contain the string `POSSIBLE` or `IMPOSSIBLE`, the program will crash.
4. **Runtime error**. The program may run out of memory or time. For example, if the graph is too large, the program may not be able to allocate enough memory to store all of the vertices and edges.
5. **Logic error**. The program may contain a logical error. For example, if the program does not check for all of the possible cases, it may produce an incorrect output.

Title:
ATCODER p03806 AtCoder Beginner Contest 054 - Mixing Experiment

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data contains integers and floating-point numbers. If you accidentally use the wrong data type, you will get a wrong answer. For example, if you use `int` to store a floating-point number, you will lose precision and get an incorrect answer.

**2. Not handling edge cases**

The input data may contain edge cases that you need to handle. For example, the input data may contain a negative number, which is not a valid chemical amount. If you do not handle this edge case, your program will crash.

**3. Making a logic error**

The problem statement is very clear about what you need to do. However, it is easy to make a logic error when you are implementing the solution. For example, you might accidentally divide by zero or you might forget to check for a condition.

**4. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved in O(N) time. However, if you use a less efficient algorithm, your program will run slower and you might not get the correct answer in time.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it to the judge. This will help you catch any bugs and ensure that your program is correct.

AIZU p00063 Palindrome

Pain points:
3. **Incorrect string comparison**. When comparing two strings, it is important to make sure that the strings are of the same length. Otherwise, the comparison will not be accurate.
4. **Incorrect use of the `reverse()` method**. The `reverse()` method reverses the order of the characters in a string. However, it does not change the length of the string. This means that if you compare a string to its reversed version, the comparison will always return `False`.
5. **Incorrect use of the `len()` function**. The `len()` function returns the length of a string. However, it does not return the number of characters in the string. This means that if you use the `len()` function to check if a string is empty, the comparison will always return `False`.
6. **Incorrect use of the `in` operator**. The `in` operator checks if a substring is contained in a string. However, it does not check if the substring is a palindrome. This means that if you use the `in` operator to check if a string is a palindrome, the comparison will always return `True`.
7. **Incorrect use of the `for` loop**. The `for` loop iterates over a sequence of elements. However, it does not check if the sequence is empty. This means that if you use the `for` loop to iterate over an empty sequence, the loop will never terminate.

Title:
AIZU p00195 What is the Most Popular Shop in Tokaichi?

Pain points:
**1. Input Format**

The input format is a sequence of multiple datasets. Each dataset is given in the following format:

```
s1A s2A
s1B s2B
s1C s2C
s1D s2D
s1E s2E
```

where `s1i` and `s2i` are the morning and afternoon sales quantities for store `i`, respectively.

The end of the input is indicated by two lines of zeros.

**2. Output Format**

For each dataset, the name of the store with the highest sales volume per day and the number of stores are output on one line.

**3. Possible Problems**

* The input format is not well-defined. It is not clear what the `s1i` and `s2i` values represent.
* The input may contain invalid values. For example, the `s1i` and `s2i` values may be negative or greater than 10000.
* The input may contain duplicate values. For example, the input may contain two datasets where the morning and afternoon sales quantities for store `A` are the same.
* The output format is not well-defined. It is not clear what the name of the store with the highest sales volume per day should be.
* The output may contain invalid values. For example, the output may contain a store name that is not one of the five stores in the input.

**4. Possible Bugs**

* The program may not correctly parse the input. For example, the program may not correctly handle the case where the input contains invalid values.
* The program may not correctly find the store with the highest sales volume per day. For example, the program may not correctly handle the case where the input contains duplicate values.
* The program may not correctly format the output. For example, the program may not correctly output the name of the store with the highest sales volume per day.

**5. Solutions**

* To avoid the problem of the input format not being well-defined, the program can explicitly define the input format. For example, the program can define the input format to be a sequence of five lines, where each line contains two integers.
* To avoid the problem of the input containing invalid values, the program can check the input values for validity. For example, the program can check that the `s1i` and `s2i` values are non-negative and less than or equal to 10000.
* To avoid the problem of the input containing duplicate values, the program can check the input values for duplicates. For example, the program can check that the `s1i` and `s2i` values are not the same for any two stores.
* To avoid the problem of the output format not being well-defined, the program can explicitly define the output format. For example, the program can define the output format to be a line that contains the name of the store with the highest sales volume per day and the number of stores.
* To avoid the problem of the program not correctly finding the store with the highest sales volume per day, the program can use a sorting algorithm to sort the stores by their sales volume per day. The store with the highest sales volume per day will be the first store in the sorted list.
* To avoid the problem of the program not correctly formatting the output, the program can use string formatting to format the output values.

Pain points:
1. **Off-by-one errors.** The chess board is a rectangle consisting of H × W squares, with the northwest corner as white, and white squares and black squares are arranged alternately. If you forget to subtract 1 from the index of the first row or column, the ants may fall off the chessboard.
2. **Incorrect handling of boundary cases.** The input may contain invalid values, such as a negative number or a number greater than the maximum value. If you do not handle these cases correctly, your program may crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect use of pointers.** When you are working with arrays or linked lists, it is important to use pointers correctly. If you do not, you may accidentally overwrite data or access memory that you do not have permission to access.
4. **Incorrect use of functions.** When you are calling functions, it is important to pass the correct arguments and to check for errors. If you do not, your program may crash or produce incorrect output.
5. **Incorrect use of data structures.** When you are using data structures, it is important to choose the correct data structure for the task at hand. If you do not, your program may be inefficient or may not work correctly.
6. **Incorrect logic.** The ants are moving all at once. All ants move one to the square in the direction facing one unit of time. However, if the destination is outside the chess board, it will fall and disappear from the chess board. When two ants enter the same square on the chess board, they behave as follows:
    * If the color of the square is white, ants traveling eastward will turn southward, and ants traveling southward will turn eastward.
    * If the square is black, each ant keeps its direction.
If you do not correctly implement this logic, your program may produce incorrect output.

AIZU p00709 Square Carpets

Pain points:
100
Possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrectly calculating the minimum number of carpets.** The developer may incorrectly calculate the minimum number of carpets by not considering all of the possible ways to cover the scratched panels. For example, the developer may only consider covering the scratched panels with square carpets of the same size, when in reality it may be possible to cover the scratched panels with a combination of different sized carpets.
2. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to calculate the minimum number of carpets. For example, the developer may use a brute force algorithm that simply tries every possible combination of carpets, when there may be a more efficient algorithm that can be used.
3. **Inefficient code.** The developer may write inefficient code that takes a long time to run. For example, the developer may use a recursive algorithm that calls itself multiple times, when a more efficient iterative algorithm could be used.
4. **Memory leaks.** The developer may create memory leaks by not freeing up memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The developer may not handle errors correctly, which can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
6. **Incorrect input validation.** The developer may not validate the input correctly, which can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

By avoiding these problems and bugs, the developer can write a program that correctly calculates the minimum number of carpets needed to cover all of the scratched panels.

Title:
AIZU p00848 Sum of Different Primes

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect formula**

The formula for the number of ways to express n as a sum of k different primes is:

```
C(n - 1, k - 1) * \prod_{i=1}^k \pi(n - i)
```

where C is the binomial coefficient and \pi is the prime-counting function. However, this formula is incorrect for k = 1, as it would give a value of 0 for all n.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

A naive algorithm for counting the number of ways to express n as a sum of k different primes would be to enumerate all possible ways to do so and then count the number of distinct ways. However, this algorithm would be very inefficient, as the number of possible ways grows exponentially with n and k.

**3. Using an incorrect data structure**

The data structure used to store the primes and their counts can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. For example, using a hash table to store the primes and their counts would be much more efficient than using a linked list.

**4. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

The boundary conditions for the problem must be handled carefully. For example, the number of ways to express n as a sum of k different primes is 0 if n < k or k < 1.

**5. Using incorrect floating-point arithmetic**

Floating-point arithmetic is notoriously imprecise, and this can lead to errors in the results of the algorithm. For example, the expression `1.0 / 3.0` might evaluate to 0.3333333333333333 instead of the exact value of 0.33333333333333333.

**6. Using incorrect integer arithmetic**

Integer arithmetic can also be imprecise, especially when dealing with large numbers. For example, the expression `2147483647 + 1` might evaluate to -2147483648 instead of the correct value of 2147483648.

**7. Using incorrect mathematical functions**

The mathematical functions used in the algorithm must be used correctly. For example, the function `log(n)` must be evaluated using the natural logarithm, not the base-10 logarithm.

**8. Using incorrect error handling**

The algorithm must be able to handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input data is invalid, the algorithm should print an error message and exit.

Pain points:
1. The input format is not very clear. It is not obvious how to parse the input into a data structure that can be used to solve the problem.
2. The problem statement does not specify what to do in the case where there are no remaining matches.
3. The algorithm for computing the number of possible win/loss patterns that lead to a full playoff is not very efficient. It takes O(n^3) time, where n is the number of teams.
4. The output format is not very clear. It is not obvious how to interpret the output of the program.

Here are some suggestions for how to avoid these problems:

1. The input format could be made more clear by using a more structured format, such as JSON or XML.
2. The problem statement could be made more clear by explicitly stating what to do in the case where there are no remaining matches.
3. The algorithm for computing the number of possible win/loss patterns could be made more efficient by using a dynamic programming approach.
4. The output format could be made more clear by using a more human-readable format, such as a table or a graph.

1. **Incorrectly handling the input format**. The input format is very specific, so it is important to make sure that you are parsing it correctly. For example, if you forget to account for the newline character between each row of the map, you will get incorrect results.
2. **Making incorrect assumptions about the map or the cube**. The map and the cube are both represented in a very specific way, so it is important to make sure that you understand how they work. For example, if you assume that the cube can always move in any direction, you will get incorrect results.
3. **Not handling all possible cases**. The problem statement describes a number of different cases that can occur, such as when the start and goal squares are the same, or when there is no path from the start to the goal. It is important to make sure that your code handles all of these cases correctly.
4. **Implementing an inefficient algorithm**. The problem can be solved in polynomial time, but there are a number of inefficient algorithms that could be used. It is important to make sure that your algorithm is efficient enough to pass the time limit.
5. **Making a mistake in your implementation**. Even the smallest mistake in your implementation can lead to incorrect results. It is important to carefully check your code for errors before submitting it.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly parsing the input format**. For example, if you forget to account for the newline character between each row of the map, you will get incorrect results.
* **Making incorrect assumptions about the map or the cube**. For example, if you assume that the cube can always move in any direction, you will get incorrect results.
* **Not handling all possible cases**. For example, if you don't handle the case where the start and goal squares are the same, you will get incorrect results.
* **Implementing an inefficient algorithm**. For example, if you use a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem, it will not pass the time limit.
* **Making a mistake in your implementation**. For example, if you forget to check for a boundary condition, you will get incorrect results.

AIZU p01865 Steelyard

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correct. For example, if the number of weights is not an integer, or if the weight is not an integer, or if the weight is negative, an error will occur.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correct. For example, if the number of weights hung by Mr. Tachiko is not an integer, or if the position or weight of the weights hung by Mr. Tachiko is not an integer, or if the weight is negative, an error will occur.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The calculation is incorrect. For example, if the sum of the weight coordinates and the weight product is not equal to 0, an error will occur.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The logic is incorrect. For example, if the scale is not balanced after Mr. Tachiko hangs the weights, an error will occur.

```
# 02002 Expression

import sys
from sys import stdin

def read():
    return stdin.readline()

def solve(s, i, j):
    if i == j:
        return int(s[i])
    if s[i] == "^":
        return solve(s, i+1, j)^solve(s, i+2, j)
    if s[i] == "&":
        return solve(s, i+1, j)&solve(s, i+2, j)
    return solve(s, i+1, j)|solve(s, i+2, j)

N = int(read())
s = read()
Q = int(read())
for _ in range(Q):
    l, r = map(int, read().split())
    print(solve(s, l-1, r-1))
```

1. **Incorrect precedence of operators.** The precedence of operators is `'^' > '&' > '|'`, so `a ^ b & c` should be evaluated as `(a ^ b) & c`, not `a ^ (b & c)`.
2. **Incorrect handling of zero-padded values.** The problem statement states that the formula does not contain zero-padded values, but this is not always true. For example, the formula `0^0&0|0` is valid.
3. **Incorrect handling of boundary cases.** The problem statement does not specify what should happen if the input is invalid. For example, what should happen if the formula is empty? Or what should happen if the interval `[i, j]` is out of bounds?
4. **Incorrect error handling.** The problem statement does not specify what should happen if an error occurs. For example, what should happen if the program runs out of memory? Or what should happen if the program encounters a divide-by-zero error?
5. **Incorrect output formatting.** The problem statement specifies that the output should be a single line of text, but this is not always true. For example, the output of the following program is not a single line of text:

```
print("Hello world")
```

6. **Incorrect use of comments.** Comments should be used to explain the code, not to obfuscate it. For example, the following code is difficult to understand because it is full of comments:

```
# This function calculates the factorial of a number.
def factorial(n):
    # If the number is 0, the factorial is 1.
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    # Otherwise, the factorial is the product of all the numbers from 1 to n.
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

7. **Incorrect use of whitespace.** Whitespace should be used to make the code more readable, not to make it less readable. For example, the following code is difficult to read because it is full of unnecessary whitespace:

```
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

8. **Incorrect use of variable names.** Variable names should be descriptive and should not be reused for different purposes. For example, the following code is difficult to understand because the variable `n` is used for two different purposes:

```
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

n = int(input())
print(factorial(n))
```

9. **Incorrect use of functions.** Functions should be used to group related code together and to make the code more modular. For example, the following code is difficult to maintain because the factorial function is hard-coded into the main function:

```
def main():
    n = int(input())
    print(factorial(n))

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

main()
```

10. **Incorrect use of libraries.** Libraries should be used to avoid reinventing the wheel and to make the code more portable. For example, the following code is difficult to maintain because the factorial function is hard-coded into the main function:

```
def main():
    n = int(input())
    print(math.factorial(n))

main()
```

Title:
AIZU p02146 Averaging

Pain points:
1. **Inconsistent constraints.** The constraints state that $0 \le X_i \le 10^9$, but the input contains $X_i = 10^10$.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer, but the example output contains multiple integers.
3. **Incorrect calculation.** The example output is incorrect. The minimum sum of costs is 11, not 10.
4. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem specifies that there are $N$ islands, but the code uses a data structure that can only store $N-1$ islands.
5. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** The problem can be solved using a minimum spanning tree algorithm, but the code uses a different algorithm that does not produce the correct answer.
6. **Incorrect error handling.** The code does not handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input is invalid, the code will crash.
7. **Incorrect documentation.** The code does not include any documentation, which makes it difficult for other developers to understand how it works.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully read the problem statement and constraints, use the correct data structures and algorithms, handle errors gracefully, and provide clear documentation.
