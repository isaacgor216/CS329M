Title:
CODEFORCES 1548_C. The Three Little Pigs


Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is "2 3 1", the program will try to read the number of pigs as "3 1", which is incorrect.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correctly formatted, which can lead to the program being rejected by the judge. For example, if the output is "9\n6\n1", the program will be rejected because the output is not on a single line.
* **Incorrect logic:** The program may contain incorrect logic, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may incorrectly count the number of possible attack plans.
* **Memory leaks:** The program may not properly release memory, which can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
* **Time complexity:** The program may have a time complexity that is too high, which can lead to the program running too slowly and being timed out by the judge.
* **Space complexity:** The program may have a space complexity that is too high, which can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and runs efficiently.

Test inputs:

CODEFORCES 1548_D1. Gregor and the Odd Cows (Easy)


Pain points:
 1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain the integer `n`. If the input format is not followed, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input format specifies that the coordinates of the fence posts should be integers. If the input contains non-integer values, the program will not be able to correctly process the input and will likely produce incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When computing the area of a triangle, it is important to make sure that the order of the vertices is correct. If the order of the vertices is incorrect, the area of the triangle will be incorrect, which could lead to incorrect results.
4. **Arithmetic errors**. When computing the area of a triangle, it is important to make sure that the arithmetic operations are performed correctly. If the arithmetic operations are not performed correctly, the area of the triangle will be incorrect, which could lead to incorrect results.
5. **Boundary conditions**. When computing the area of a triangle, it is important to make sure that the boundary conditions are handled correctly. For example, if the triangle has zero area, the program should return 0.
6. **Memory errors**. The program should be careful not to allocate too much memory. If the program allocates too much memory, it could crash or run out of memory.
7. **Time complexity**. The program should be as efficient as possible. The time complexity of the program should be O(n), where n is the number of fence posts.
8. **Space complexity**. The program should use as little space as possible. The space complexity of the program should be O(n), where n is the number of fence posts.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1548_E. Gregor and the Two Painters


Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input format is not specified clearly. For example, is `n` a single integer or a list of `n` integers?
* The output format is not specified clearly. For example, should the output be a single integer or a list of integers?
* The problem statement is not clear. For example, what does it mean for a cell to be "badly painted"?
* The algorithm is not correct. For example, the algorithm may not find all of the badly painted regions.
* The algorithm is inefficient. For example, the algorithm may take a long time to run.
* The code is not well-written. For example, the code may be difficult to understand or maintain.

Here are some specific examples of problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer may not correctly parse the input data. For example, the developer may assume that `n` is a single integer when it is actually a list of `n` integers.
* The developer may not correctly implement the algorithm. For example, the developer may not correctly check if a cell is badly painted.
* The developer may not correctly handle corner cases. For example, the developer may not correctly handle the case where the ceiling is empty.
* The developer may not correctly optimize the algorithm. For example, the developer may not use a data structure that is well-suited for the problem.
* The developer may not correctly write the code. For example, the developer may use incorrect variable names or write code that is difficult to understand.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1549_A. Gregor and Cryptography


Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong algorithm**

The most common mistake is to use the wrong algorithm to solve the problem. The problem asks for two bases of P, which means that we need to find two integers a and b such that P mod a = P mod b. The most common way to do this is to use the Euclidean algorithm, but this algorithm only works if P is prime. If P is not prime, then the Euclidean algorithm will not find two bases of P.

**2. Not handling the case where P is not prime**

Another common mistake is to not handle the case where P is not prime. If P is not prime, then the Euclidean algorithm will not find two bases of P. In this case, we need to use a different algorithm to find two bases of P.

**3. Using incorrect input**

Another common mistake is to use incorrect input. The problem states that P must be prime, and that P must be between 5 and 10^9. If P is not prime or if P is not in the correct range, then the problem cannot be solved.

**4. Not handling the case where there are no solutions**

Finally, it is important to handle the case where there are no solutions. This can happen if P is prime and if P is odd. In this case, there are no two integers a and b such that P mod a = P mod b.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem is asking for the maximum number of Gregor's pawns that can reach row 1, not the number of enemy pawns that can reach row n.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution should consider all possible moves for Gregor's pawns and find the maximum number of pawns that can reach row 1.
3. **Incorrect testing.** The test cases should be comprehensive and cover all possible cases.
4. **Incorrect submission.** The submission should be in the correct format and comply with the competition rules.
5. **Incorrect runtime.** The solution should be efficient enough to pass the time limit.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1549_D. Integers Have Friends


Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem is to implement the algorithm incorrectly. This can lead to incorrect results or even a runtime error.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the exact requirements. It is also helpful to draw a diagram or write out a few examples to help you understand the algorithm.

**2. Using an incorrect data structure**

Another common mistake is to use an incorrect data structure. For example, if the input array is very large, it is not a good idea to use a list to store the elements. This is because lists are not very efficient for storing large amounts of data.

Instead, it is better to use a data structure that is specifically designed for storing large amounts of data, such as a hash table or a binary search tree.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The third most common mistake is to use an incorrect algorithm. For example, if the input array is very large, it is not a good idea to use a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem. This is because brute-force algorithms are very inefficient for large inputs.

Instead, it is better to use a more efficient algorithm, such as a divide-and-conquer algorithm or a greedy algorithm.

**4. Not handling special cases correctly**

Another common mistake is to not handle special cases correctly. For example, if the input array is empty, it is important to handle this case gracefully.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and identify any special cases that need to be handled.

**5. Not testing your code**

Finally, it is important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. This can be done by writing unit tests or by manually testing your code.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving the integers have friends problem.

CODEFORCES 1551_A. Polycarp and Coins


Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input and output of this problem are integers. If you use the wrong data type, such as float, you will get incorrect results.

**2. Not handling the corner cases**

The input of this problem can be 1 or 10^9. If you don't handle the corner cases, your code will not work correctly.

**3. Using an inefficient algorithm**

The naive solution to this problem is to try all possible combinations of c_1 and c_2. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2). There is a more efficient algorithm that has a time complexity of O(n).

**4. Not using a constant-time lookup table**

The input of this problem can be repeated. If you don't use a constant-time lookup table, your code will have a time complexity of O(n^2).

**5. Making a mistake in the implementation**

Even if you understand the problem and have a correct algorithm, you can still make a mistake in the implementation. Be careful to check your code carefully before submitting it.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1551_B1. Wonderful Coloring - 1


Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Off-by-one errors.** When counting the number of letters in a string, it is easy to make a mistake and count one letter too many or too few. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem requires that you use a data structure to store the letters of the string. If you use the wrong data structure, it may not be able to store all of the letters, or it may not be able to efficiently access the letters when you need them. This can lead to incorrect results or slow performance.
3. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** The problem requires that you use an algorithm to find the maximum number of letters that can be painted in red. If you use the wrong algorithm, it may not find the optimal solution, or it may take a long time to run. This can lead to incorrect results or slow performance.
4. **Incorrect error handling.** The problem may contain invalid input, such as a string that is empty or contains non-alphabetic characters. If you do not handle these errors correctly, your program may crash or produce incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect code formatting.** Your code should be well-formatted and easy to read. This will make it easier for you to debug and maintain your code.
6. **Incorrect comments.** Your code should be well-commented. This will make it easier for you to understand what your code is doing.
7. **Incorrect naming conventions.** Your code should use consistent naming conventions. This will make it easier for you to read and understand your code.
8. **Incorrect use of libraries.** If you use libraries in your code, you must make sure that you use them correctly. This will prevent errors and make your code more reliable.
9. **Incorrect testing.** You must test your code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. This will help you to catch errors early and prevent them from causing problems in production.
10. **Incorrect documentation.** You must document your code so that other developers can understand how it works. This will make it easier for others to use your code and contribute to your project.

CODEFORCES 1551_B2. Wonderful Coloring - 2


Pain points:
**Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs**

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**

The input format is not very complicated, but it is still possible to make mistakes when reading it. For example, you might forget to check that the number of test cases is positive, or that the number of elements in the sequence is not greater than the number of colors.

2. **Incorrect Implementation of the Algorithm**

The algorithm for finding a wonderful coloring is not very complicated, but it is still possible to make mistakes when implementing it. For example, you might forget to check that the colors are used in a balanced way, or that no two elements with the same value are painted in the same color.

3. **Incorrect Output Handling**

The output format is not very complicated, but it is still possible to make mistakes when printing it. For example, you might forget to add spaces between the numbers in the coloring, or you might print the numbers in the wrong order.

4. **Overall Solution Design**

The overall solution design is also important. For example, you might choose an inefficient algorithm for finding a wonderful coloring, or you might use too much memory.

5. **Testing**

It is important to test your solution thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly. You should test your solution on a variety of different input cases, including cases where the input is invalid.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1551_C. Interesting Story


Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of data structures**. The problem requires us to count the number of times each letter appears in the input. A common mistake is to use a hash map to store the frequencies of each letter. However, this can lead to a time complexity of O(n) per test case, where n is the number of words in the input. A more efficient solution is to use a bit vector, which can be used to count the frequencies of each letter in O(1) time.
2. **Incorrect use of bit operations**. Bit vectors are a powerful tool, but they can be tricky to use correctly. One common mistake is to use the wrong bitwise operator. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
int count_bits(int n) {
  int count = 0;
  while (n > 0) {
    count += n & 1;
    n >>= 1;
  }
  return count;
}
```

The problem with this code is that the & operator is used to perform a bitwise AND operation, not a bitwise OR operation. This means that the count variable will only be incremented when the least significant bit of n is set. To fix this, we can use the | operator instead of the & operator.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that can occur when working with arrays or indices. In this problem, it is important to be careful when indexing into the input array and the bit vector. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
int max_interesting_story(int n, vector<string>& words) {
  // Create a bit vector to store the frequencies of each letter.
  bitset<26> frequencies;

  // Iterate over the words in the input.
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // Iterate over the letters in the word.
    for (char c : words[i]) {
      // Increase the frequency of the letter in the bit vector.
      frequencies[c - 'a']++;
    }
  }

  // Find the letter with the highest frequency.
  int max_frequency = 0;
  int max_letter = -1;
  for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
    if (frequencies[i] > max_frequency) {
      max_frequency = frequencies[i];
      max_letter = i;
    }
  }

  // Return the number of words that contain the letter with the highest frequency.
  int count = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (words[i].find(max_letter + 'a') != string::npos) {
      count++;
    }
  }

  return count;
}
```

The problem with this code is that the index of the letter in the bit vector is one less than the ASCII value of the letter. This means that the letter 'a' will be stored at index 0, the letter 'b' will be stored at index 1, and so on. This will cause the code to incorrectly count the number of words that contain the letter with the highest frequency. To fix this, we need to add 1 to the index of the letter when we are iterating over the bit vector.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. The problem statement specifies that the input may contain duplicate words. This means that we need to be careful when we are counting the number of words that contain a particular letter. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
int count_words(int n, vector<string>& words, char letter) {
  int count = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (words[i].find(letter) != string::npos) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
}
```

The problem with this code is that it will count each word that contains the letter multiple times. To fix this, we need to use a set to store the unique words that contain the letter. Then, we can iterate over the set and count the number of words that it contains.
5. **Incorrect use of dynamic programming**. Dynamic programming is a powerful technique that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. However, it is important to use dynamic programming correctly. For example, the following code will not work

CODEFORCES 1551_D1. Domino (easy version)


Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the parsing process. For example, if the input contains a space between two integers, the program may interpret the space as a delimiter and read the two integers as separate values.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong data type, which may lead to errors in the calculation process. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program may try to convert the string to an integer and fail.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When performing calculations, it is important to make sure that the indices are correct. For example, if the program is looping through a list of numbers, it is important to make sure that the index does not go out of bounds.
4. **Arithmetic errors**. When performing calculations, it is important to make sure that the calculations are correct. For example, if the program is dividing two numbers, it is important to make sure that the denominator is not zero.
5. **Logic errors**. The program may contain logical errors that cause it to produce incorrect results. For example, the program may not correctly check for all possible cases.
6. **Memory errors**. The program may run out of memory if it allocates too much memory. For example, if the program is creating a large data structure, it is important to make sure that the data structure is not too large.
7. **Timeout errors**. The program may time out if it takes too long to run. For example, if the program is performing a complex calculation, it is important to make sure that the calculation does not take too long.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may contain security vulnerabilities that allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system. For example, the program may not properly validate user input, which could allow attackers to inject malicious code into the system.
9. **Usability issues**. The program may be difficult to use or understand. For example, the program may have a complex user interface or it may not provide clear error messages.
10. **Performance issues**. The program may be slow or inefficient. For example, the program may use a inefficient algorithm or it may not be properly optimized.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1551_F. Equidistant Vertices


Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm**

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a well-known algorithm for finding all shortest paths in a weighted graph. However, it is important to implement the algorithm correctly, as a mistake can lead to incorrect results.

One common mistake is to use the wrong formula for computing the distance between two vertices. The correct formula is

```
d[i][j] = min(d[i][j], d[i][k] + d[k][j])
```

where `d[i][j]` is the distance from vertex `i` to vertex `j`, and `k` is an intermediate vertex.

Another common mistake is to forget to initialize the distance matrix to infinity. This can lead to incorrect results, as the algorithm will not be able to find the shortest paths.

**2. Incorrect handling of negative weights**

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can only be used on graphs with non-negative weights. If a graph contains negative weights, the algorithm will not work correctly.

**3. Incorrect handling of parallel edges**

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can only be used on graphs with no parallel edges. If a graph contains parallel edges, the algorithm will not work correctly.

**4. Incorrect handling of self-loops**

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can only be used on graphs with no self-loops. If a graph contains self-loops, the algorithm will not work correctly.

**5. Incorrect handling of disconnected graphs**

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can only be used on connected graphs. If a graph is disconnected, the algorithm will not work correctly.

**6. Incorrect handling of weighted trees**

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can only be used on unweighted trees. If a tree is weighted, the algorithm will not work correctly.

CODEFORCES 1552_A. Subsequence Permutation


Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrectly counting the number of inversions.** In order to find the minimum number of characters that need to be permuted in order to sort the string, we need to count the number of inversions in the string. An inversion is a pair of characters `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `s[i] > s[j]`. The number of inversions can be found using a divide-and-conquer algorithm.
2. **Not considering the case where the string is already sorted.** If the string is already sorted, then no characters need to be permuted in order to sort it. This case can be easily handled by checking if the string is sorted before counting the number of inversions.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm to sort the characters.** Once the number of inversions has been counted, the characters can be sorted using any sorting algorithm. However, it is important to use an algorithm that is efficient for small inputs. A good choice would be insertion sort or merge sort.
4. **Not handling the case where the input is invalid.** The input to the problem may be invalid. For example, the input string may contain characters that are not lowercase letters of the English alphabet. In this case, the program should print an error message and exit.
5. **Not handling the case where the input is too large.** The input to the problem may be too large to be processed by the program. In this case, the program should print an error message and exit.

        print(-1)
    else:
        min_i = min(dic,key=dic.get)
        print(min_i+1)
```

Possible problems and bugs:

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not correctly parsed, which may result in incorrect results. For example, if the input is `1`, the code will print `1`, which is incorrect.
2. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect, which may result in incorrect results. For example, the following algorithm is incorrect:

```
def solve(n, a):
  for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
      if i != j and a[i][0] < a[j][0] and a[i][1] < a[j][1] and a[i][2] < a[j][2] and a[i][3] < a[j][3] and a[i][4] < a[j][4]:
        return i + 1
  return -1
```

This algorithm will incorrectly return `-1` for all inputs, even if there is a winner.
3. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not correctly formatted, which may result in the problem being marked as incorrect. For example, if the output is `1`, the problem will be marked as incorrect.
4. **Memory limit exceeded.** The code may use too much memory, which may result in the problem being timed out. For example, the following code uses a lot of memory:

```
def solve(n, a):
  for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
      if i != j and a[i][0] < a[j][0] and a[i][1] < a[j][1] and a[i][2] < a[j][2] and a[i][3] < a[j][3] and a[i][4] < a[j][4]:
        return i + 1
  return -1
```

This code will use O(n^2) memory, which may be too much for large inputs.
5. **Time limit exceeded.** The code may take too long to run, which may result in the problem being timed out. For example, the following code takes a long time to run:

```
def solve(n, a):
  for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
      if i != j and a[i][0] < a[j][0] and a[i][1] < a[j][1] and a[i][2] < a[j][2] and a[i][3] < a[j][3] and a[i][4] < a[j][4]:
        return i + 1
  return -1
```

This code will take O(n^2) time to run, which may be too long for large inputs.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format, the algorithm, the output format, and the memory and time usage of the code.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1552_C. Maximize the Intersections


Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very clear. It is not clear whether the first line of each test case should contain two integers n and k, or whether it should contain the endpoints of the k chords. This can lead to errors if the developer does not read the problem statement carefully.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of intersections**

The maximum number of intersections is the number of ways to choose n - k chords from the remaining 2(n - k) points such that no two chords intersect. This can be calculated using the following formula:

```
max_intersections = (2(n - k) choose n - k) - (2(n - k) choose n - k - 1)
```

However, the developer may make a mistake in calculating this formula, or they may not realize that the maximum number of intersections is not always achievable.

**3. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The algorithm for finding the maximum number of intersections is not very difficult, but it is important to implement it correctly. The developer may make a mistake in the algorithm, or they may not realize that the algorithm is not always correct.

**4. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

The problem statement specifies a few edge cases, such as the case where there are no more chords to draw. The developer must make sure to handle these edge cases correctly.

**5. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is not very clear. It is not clear whether the output should be a single integer, or whether it should be a list of integers. This can lead to errors if the developer does not read the problem statement carefully.

4. **Incorrect data types**. The data types used in the program may be incorrect. This can lead to errors such as "integer overflow" or "floating-point error". To avoid this, make sure that the data types are correct and that they are large enough to hold the values that they need to.
5. **Incorrect variable names**. The variable names used in the program may be incorrect. This can lead to errors such as "undeclared variable" or "variable shadowing". To avoid this, make sure that the variable names are clear and concise, and that they do not conflict with each other.
6. **Incorrect indentation**. The indentation of the code may be incorrect. This can lead to errors such as "syntax error" or "unreadable code". To avoid this, make sure that the code is correctly indented and that it is easy to read.
7. **Incorrect comments**. The comments in the code may be incorrect. This can lead to errors such as "unnecessary comment" or "misleading comment". To avoid this, make sure that the comments are clear and concise, and that they provide useful information.
8. **Incorrect code style**. The code style may be incorrect. This can lead to errors such as "unreadable code" or "difficult to maintain code". To avoid this, make sure that the code is written in a consistent style, and that it is easy to read and maintain.
9. **Incorrect naming conventions**. The naming conventions used in the code may be incorrect. This can lead to errors such as "unclear code" or "difficult to maintain code". To avoid this, make sure that the naming conventions are consistent and that they are easy to understand.
10. **Incorrect error handling**. The error handling in the code may be incorrect. This can lead to errors such as "crashing program" or "silent errors". To avoid this, make sure that the errors are handled correctly and that the user is informed of any problems.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1553_B. Reverse String


Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of string functions.** For example, using `s[i] + 1` to get the character after `s[i]` will cause an error if `s[i]` is the last character in the string.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over a string, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one character or include an extra character.
3. **Incorrect handling of empty strings.** Some string functions, such as `len()`, will return an error if you try to use them on an empty string.
4. **Incorrect use of pointers.** When working with pointers to strings, it is important to make sure that you are dereferencing the pointers correctly and that you are not accessing memory that you do not have permission to access.
5. **Memory leaks.** When allocating memory for a string, it is important to free the memory when you are finished with it. If you do not free the memory, you will eventually run out of memory and your program will crash.
6. **Security vulnerabilities.** Strings can be used to store sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers. It is important to take steps to protect this information from being stolen or misused.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

1. **Use the correct string functions.** For example, use `s[i] + 1` to get the character after `s[i]` and `len(s)` to get the length of the string.
2. **Check for off-by-one errors.** When iterating over a string, make sure to check for the end of the string and to avoid including an extra character.
3. **Handle empty strings correctly.** Some string functions, such as `len()`, will return an error if you try to use them on an empty string. Make sure to handle this case gracefully.
4. **Use pointers correctly.** When working with pointers to strings, make sure that you are dereferencing the pointers correctly and that you are not accessing memory that you do not have permission to access.
5. **Free memory when you are finished with it.** When allocating memory for a string, it is important to free the memory when you are finished with it. This will help to prevent memory leaks.
6. **Protect sensitive information.** Strings can be used to store sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers. It is important to take steps to protect this information from being stolen or misused.

CODEFORCES 1553_C. Penalty


Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The `kicks_count` variable should be of type `int` instead of `str`.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator.** The `if` statement should use the `<=` operator instead of the `==` operator.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The `if` statement should check if the `current_team_goals` is greater than the `remaining_goals` for the other team, not if it is equal to the `remaining_goals`.
4. **Off-by-one error.** The `remaining_goals` should be decremented by 1 after each kick, not by 2.
5. **Infinite loop.** The `while` loop should have a condition that checks if the `current_team_goals` is greater than the `remaining_goals` for the other team, not if it is equal to the `remaining_goals`.
6. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer, not a string.
7. **Missing semicolon.** The `return` statement should end with a semicolon.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1553_D. Backspace


Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the `cin` and `cout` objects.** The `cin` object should be used to read input from the user, and the `cout` object should be used to write output to the console. However, some developers may accidentally use these objects in the wrong way, which can lead to errors. For example, a developer might try to use `cin` to write output to the console, or they might try to use `cout` to read input from the user. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect use of the `string` class.** The `string` class is a powerful tool for working with strings in C++, but it can be easy to make mistakes when using it. For example, a developer might accidentally try to compare two strings using the `==` operator, when they should be using the `===` operator. This can lead to errors because the `==` operator compares the values of two objects, while the `===` operator compares the references to two objects.
3. **Incorrect use of the `vector` class.** The `vector` class is a powerful tool for working with collections of data in C++, but it can be easy to make mistakes when using it. For example, a developer might accidentally try to access an element of a vector that doesn't exist, or they might try to add an element to a vector that is already full. This can lead to errors because the `vector` class doesn't have any bounds checking, so it's up to the developer to make sure that they're using the class correctly.
4. **Incorrect use of the `algorithm` library.** The `algorithm` library contains a number of useful functions for working with data in C++, but it can be easy to make mistakes when using it. For example, a developer might accidentally try to use a function that doesn't exist, or they might try to use a function with the wrong arguments. This can lead to errors because the `algorithm` library doesn't have any error checking, so it's up to the developer to make sure that they're using the library correctly.
5. **Incorrect use of the `std::cin` and `std::cout` objects.** The `std::cin` and `std::cout` objects are used to read and write data from the console in C++. However, it's important to use these objects correctly to avoid errors. For example, you should always use the `std::endl` object to flush the output buffer after writing data to the console. Otherwise, the data might not be displayed correctly.
6. **Incorrect use of the `std::vector` class.** The `std::vector` class is a powerful tool for storing data in C++. However, it's important to use this class correctly to avoid errors. For example, you should always use the `std::vector::size()` function to get the size of a vector before trying to access its elements. Otherwise, you might get an `out-of-bounds` error.
7. **Incorrect use of the `std::string` class.** The `std::string` class is a powerful tool for working with strings in C++. However, it's important to use this class correctly to avoid errors. For example, you should always use the `std::string::length()` function to get the length of a string before trying to access its elements. Otherwise, you might get an `out-of-bounds` error.
8. **Incorrect use of the `std::algorithm` library.** The `std::algorithm` library contains a number of useful functions for working with data in C++. However, it's important to use this library correctly to avoid errors. For example, you should always use the `std::algorithm::find()` function to find an element in a container. Otherwise, you might get a `std::invalid_argument` error.
9. **Incorrect use of the `std::exception` class.** The `std::exception` class is the base class for all exceptions in C++. However, it's important to use this class correctly to avoid errors. For example, you should always catch exceptions by their type. Otherwise, you might not be able to handle the exception correctly.
10. **Incorrect use of the `std::terminate()` function.** The `std::terminate()` function is used to terminate a program in C++. However, it's important to use this function correctly to avoid errors. For example, you should only call this function when you know that the program cannot continue. Otherwise, you might cause the program to crash.

CODEFORCES 1553_E. Permutation Shift


Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correctly specified. For example, the input may contain a negative number or a number that is too large.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correctly specified. For example, the output may contain a number that is not an integer or a number that is not in the correct range.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic of the program may be incorrect. For example, the program may not correctly find all possible values of k for the cyclic shift operation.

CODEFORCES 1553_F. Pairwise Modulo


Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain the number of elements in the array, and the second line should contain the elements of the array. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to read the input correctly and will produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect array size.** The input format specifies that the array should have a size of at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5. If the array size is less than 2 or greater than 2 * 10^5, the program will not be able to process the array correctly and will produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect array elements.** The input format specifies that the elements of the array should be distinct positive integers. If any of the elements of the array are not distinct or are not positive integers, the program will not be able to process the array correctly and will produce incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect calculation of p_k.** The formula for calculating p_k is $$p_k = \sum_{1 \leq i, j \leq k} a_i \bmod a_j$$. If this formula is not used correctly, the program will not be able to calculate p_k correctly and will produce incorrect output.
5. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the output should contain n integers, p_1, p_2, ..., p_n. If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to produce the correct output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1553_G. Common Divisor Graph


Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is specified as follows:

```
n q
a_1, a_2, ..., a_n
s_1 t_1
s_2 t_2
...
s_q t_q
```

where `n` and `q` are integers, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` and `s_1, t_1, ..., s_q, t_q` are lists of integers.

However, some developers may incorrectly parse the input, leading to errors. For example, a developer might mistakenly parse the input as follows:

```
n q
a_1, a_2, ..., a_n
s_1, t_1
s_2, t_2
...
s_q, t_q
```

This would result in the `s_1, t_1, ..., s_q, t_q` list being parsed as a single list of integers, which would cause an error when the program attempts to access the individual elements of the list.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is specified as follows:

```
q lines
1
1
...
1
```

where each line contains a single integer representing the minimum number of new nodes that need to be created in order to reach the target node from the starting node.

However, some developers may incorrectly format their output, leading to errors. For example, a developer might mistakenly output the following:

```
1
1
...
1
```

This would result in the output being interpreted as a single list of integers, which would cause an error when the program attempts to access the individual elements of the list.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of new nodes**

The minimum number of new nodes that need to be created in order to reach the target node from the starting node can be calculated using the following formula:

```
min_nodes = max(gcd(a_s, a_t), gcd(a_s, a_s * a_t))
```

where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor function.

However, some developers may incorrectly calculate the minimum number of new nodes, leading to errors. For example, a developer might mistakenly calculate the minimum number of new nodes as follows:

```
min_nodes = gcd(a_s, a_t)
```

This would result in the minimum number of new nodes being overestimated, which would lead to an incorrect solution.

**4. Incorrect handling of repeated nodes**

The input for this problem may contain repeated nodes. For example, the input may contain the following list of nodes:

```
1, 2, 1, 3
```

In this case, the starting node and the target node are the same (both equal to 1). Some developers may incorrectly handle this case, leading to errors. For example, a developer might mistakenly assume that the starting node and the target node are different, and then incorrectly calculate the minimum number of new nodes.

**5. Incorrect handling of negative nodes**

The input for this problem may contain negative nodes. For example, the input may contain the following list of nodes:

```
-1, 2, -3
```

Some developers may incorrectly handle this case, leading to errors. For example, a developer might mistakenly assume that all nodes are positive, and then incorrectly calculate the minimum number of new nodes.

**6. Incorrect handling of zero nodes**

The input for this problem may contain zero nodes. For example, the input may contain the following list of nodes:

```
0, 2, 0
```

Some developers may incorrectly handle this case, leading to errors. For example, a developer might mistakenly assume that all nodes are non-zero, and then incorrectly calculate the minimum number of new nodes.

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not as expected. For example, the input may not have two integers n and k, or the integers may not be in the correct range.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not as expected. For example, the output may not have 2^k integers, or the integers may not be in the correct range.
* **Incorrect algorithm:** The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not find the correct minimum absolute difference of two elements.
* **Incorrect implementation:** The implementation of the algorithm may be incorrect. For example, the implementation may have a bug that causes the algorithm to output incorrect results.
* **Runtime error:** The algorithm may run into a runtime error. For example, the algorithm may run out of memory or time.
* **Memory error:** The algorithm may use too much memory. For example, the algorithm may create a large data structure that takes up too much memory.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to design and implement an efficient algorithm and to carefully test the implementation.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1553_I. Stairs


Pain points:
### Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrect implementation of the stair array definition.** The stair array is defined as the length of the longest segment of permutation which contains position `i` and is made of consecutive values in sorted order. This means that the stair array for the permutation `[4, 1, 2, 3, 7, 6, 5]` should be `[1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, not `[1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of permutations with a given stair array.** The number of permutations with a given stair array can be calculated using the following formula:

```
P(n, a) = (n! / a!) * (a! / (a - 1)!)
```

where `n` is the length of the permutation and `a` is the stair array. However, it is important to note that this formula only applies to permutations that are in sorted order. If the permutation is not in sorted order, then the number of permutations will be different.
3. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic.** When calculating the number of permutations with a given stair array, it is important to use modulo arithmetic to ensure that the answer is correct. This is because the number of permutations can be very large, and using modulo arithmetic will prevent the answer from overflowing.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** There are a number of edge cases that need to be handled when solving this problem. For example, what happens if the stair array is empty? What happens if the stair array contains only one element? What happens if the stair array contains all of the same element? It is important to consider all of these edge cases and to handle them correctly.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs that developers encounter when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1554_A. Cherry


Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The input is a list of integers, so it is tempting to use a list to store the integers. However, this can lead to problems if the list is too large. For example, if the list has a million elements, it will take up a lot of memory and slow down your program. A better solution would be to use a data structure that is more efficient for storing large amounts of data, such as a hash table or a binary search tree.
2. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** The problem asks you to find the maximum value of a product of two subarrays. A naive solution would be to iterate over all possible subarrays and find the one with the largest product. However, this is very inefficient, as the number of subarrays is exponential in the size of the input. A better solution would be to use a dynamic programming algorithm, which can find the maximum product in a subarray in O(n) time.
3. **Incorrect error handling.** The problem does not specify what to do if the input is invalid. For example, if the input list is empty, your program should probably print an error message and exit.
4. **Incorrect output formatting.** The problem specifies that the output should be a single integer. Make sure that your program outputs the correct format, or your submission will be rejected.
5. **Missing test cases.** It is important to test your program with a variety of test cases, including both small and large inputs. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed.
6. **Not using a debugger.** A debugger can be a very helpful tool for debugging your code. It allows you to step through your code line by line and see how it is behaving. This can help you to identify bugs that you may not have been able to find otherwise.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1554_B. Cobb


Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very clear. It is not clear whether the first line of each test case contains two integers n and k, or n and a_1. This can lead to errors in parsing the input and computing the output.

**2. Incorrect calculation of i ⋅ j - k ⋅ (a_i | a_j)**

The formula for i ⋅ j - k ⋅ (a_i | a_j) is not very intuitive. It is easy to make mistakes when computing this expression.

**3. Inefficient algorithm**

The naive algorithm for solving this problem would be to iterate over all pairs of integers (i, j) with 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n and compute i ⋅ j - k ⋅ (a_i | a_j). This algorithm would have a time complexity of O(n^2).

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is not very clear. It is not clear whether the output should be a single integer or a list of integers. This can lead to errors in printing the output.

**5. Runtime errors**

The program may run into runtime errors if it allocates too much memory or if it tries to access invalid memory. This can be caused by a number of factors, such as incorrect memory management, incorrect input validation, or incorrect error handling.

**6. Logical errors**

The program may contain logical errors that cause it to produce incorrect results. This can be caused by a number of factors, such as incorrect assumptions about the input data, incorrect implementation of the algorithm, or incorrect error handling.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1554_C. Mikasa


Pain points:
**Possible Problems and Bugs:**

1. **Incorrect use of the bitwise XOR operator.** The bitwise XOR operator (`^`) performs a bitwise exclusive OR operation on two integers. This means that it returns a 1 if exactly one of the operands is a 1, and a 0 otherwise. For example, `5 ^ 7` returns 6 because 5 has a 1 in the 2nd bit and 7 has a 1 in the 3rd bit, but neither has a 1 in both the 2nd and 3rd bits.
2. **Using an incorrect range for the MEX.** The MEX of a sequence of non-negative integers is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the sequence. This means that the MEX must be less than or equal to the largest integer in the sequence. For example, the MEX of the sequence `[0, 1, 2, 3]` is 4 because 4 is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the sequence.
3. **Not handling the case where the MEX is equal to the largest integer in the sequence.** In some cases, the MEX of a sequence may be equal to the largest integer in the sequence. For example, the MEX of the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4]` is 4 because 4 is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the sequence. In this case, you should return the largest integer in the sequence.
4. **Not handling the case where the MEX is not in the sequence.** In some cases, the MEX of a sequence may not be in the sequence. For example, the MEX of the sequence `[0, 1, 2]` is 3 because 3 is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the sequence. In this case, you should return the smallest non-negative integer that is greater than all of the integers in the sequence.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems and bugs:

* **Be careful when using the bitwise XOR operator.** Make sure that you understand how the operator works and that you are using it correctly.
* **Always check the range of the MEX.** Make sure that the MEX is less than or equal to the largest integer in the sequence.
* **Handle the case where the MEX is equal to the largest integer in the sequence.** In this case, you should return the largest integer in the sequence.
* **Handle the case where the MEX is not in the sequence.** In this case, you should return the smallest non-negative integer that is greater than all of the integers in the sequence.

CODEFORCES 1555_B. Two Tables


Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not strictly defined. For example, the input could contain spaces between the numbers, or the numbers could be written in scientific notation. The developer should make sure to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem is also not strictly defined. For example, the output could contain trailing zeros, or the numbers could be rounded to a different precision than what is specified in the problem statement. The developer should make sure to format the output correctly.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm for solving the problem. For example, the algorithm may not take into account all of the constraints of the problem, or it may not be efficient enough. The developer should carefully design and implement the algorithm to ensure that it is correct and efficient.
4. **Incorrect error handling**. The developer should handle errors gracefully. For example, the code should handle the case where the input is invalid, or the case where the algorithm fails to find a solution. The developer should make sure that the program does not crash or produce incorrect output in these cases.
5. **Incorrect testing**. The developer should test the program thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and efficient. The tests should cover all of the different cases that the program could encounter. The developer should also make sure to test the program with different input data sets to ensure that it is robust.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1555_E. Boring Segments


Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format is not correctly parsed, which may cause the program to crash or output incorrect results. For example, if the input format is incorrect, the program may not be able to find the number of segments or the number of integer points.

### 2. Incorrect data type

The data type of the input values may not be correctly specified, which may cause the program to crash or output incorrect results. For example, if the input values are strings instead of integers, the program may not be able to perform mathematical operations on them.

### 3. Incorrect logic

The logic of the program may be incorrect, which may cause the program to output incorrect results. For example, the program may not be able to find the minimum cost of a good subset.

### 4. Off-by-one errors

Off-by-one errors occur when the program skips or repeats one or more steps. This can cause the program to output incorrect results. For example, the program may miss a segment when calculating the minimum cost of a good subset.

### 5. Memory leaks

Memory leaks occur when the program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.

### 6. Race conditions

Race conditions occur when two or more parts of the program access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.

### 7. Deadlocks

Deadlocks occur when two or more parts of the program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish until the other one does. This can cause the program to run indefinitely or crash.

### 8. Security vulnerabilities

Security vulnerabilities occur when the program allows attackers to access sensitive data or execute arbitrary code. This can allow attackers to steal data, damage the system, or take control of the system.

CODEFORCES 1555_F. Good Graph


Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type for `n` and `q`.** The problem states that `n` and `q` should be integers, but the developer may accidentally use a different data type, such as a float or string. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect data type for `u`, `v`, and `x`.** The problem states that `u`, `v`, and `x` should be integers, but the developer may accidentally use a different data type, such as a float or string. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect input format.** The problem states that the input should be a list of integers, but the developer may accidentally input a list of strings or a list of floats. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The problem states that the output should be a list of strings, but the developer may accidentally output a list of integers or a list of floats. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect logic.** The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program, such as using the wrong data structure or algorithm. This would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
6. **Off-by-one errors.** The developer may accidentally miscount the number of vertices or edges in the graph, which would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
7. **Memory leaks.** The developer may accidentally create a memory leak, which would cause the program to use up more memory than it needs. This could eventually cause the program to crash.
8. **Race conditions.** The developer may accidentally create a race condition, which could cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
9. **Deadlocks.** The developer may accidentally create a deadlock, which could cause the program to hang indefinitely.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1556_A. A Variety of Operations


Pain points:
 1. **Incorrect use of data types.** The problem states that `c` and `d` are integers in the range `[0, 10^9]`. However, some solutions incorrectly use `int` or `long` to store these values, which can lead to overflow errors. To avoid this, you should use `long long` or `unsigned long long`.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of operations.** The problem states that the goal is to make `a` equal to `c` and `b` equal to `d`. However, some solutions incorrectly try to minimize the sum of the absolute values of `a - c` and `b - d`. This is not correct, because it is possible that `a - c` and `b - d` have opposite signs, in which case the sum of their absolute values is not minimized by making `a` equal to `c` and `b` equal to `d`. To avoid this, you should first determine the sign of `a - c` and `b - d`. If they have opposite signs, then you should make `a` equal to the smaller of `c` and `d` and `b` equal to the larger of `c` and `d`.
3. **Incorrect handling of negative values.** The problem states that `a` and `b` may become negative after performing operations. However, some solutions incorrectly assume that `a` and `b` are always non-negative. This can lead to errors when calculating the number of operations. To avoid this, you should check whether `a` and `b` are negative before performing any operations.
4. **Incorrect use of the `abs()` function.** The `abs()` function returns the absolute value of a number. However, some solutions incorrectly use the `abs()` function to calculate the sum of the absolute values of `a - c` and `b - d`. This is not correct, because the `abs()` function is not commutative. To avoid this, you should use the following formula to calculate the sum of the absolute values of `a - c` and `b - d`:

```
abs(a - c) + abs(b - d) = 2 * max(abs(a - c), abs(b - d))
```

5. **Incorrect use of the `min()` and `max()` functions.** The `min()` function returns the smaller of two numbers, and the `max()` function returns the larger of two numbers. However, some solutions incorrectly use the `min()` and `max()` functions to calculate the number of operations. This is not correct, because the `min()` and `max()` functions do not take into account the sign of `a - c` and `b - d`. To avoid this, you should use the following formula to calculate the number of operations:

```
min(abs(a - c), abs(b - d)) + max(abs(a - c), abs(b - d))
```

Pain points:
 3. swap(2, 3). Array after performing the operation: [6, 2, 3, 5, 4, 1] 
 **Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement is not very clear, so it is important to read it carefully and make sure you understand what you are being asked to do.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution to this problem is not trivial, so it is important to make sure you implement it correctly.
3. **Incorrect test cases.** The test cases provided are not always comprehensive, so it is important to write your own test cases to make sure your solution is correct.
4. **Incorrect runtime analysis.** The time complexity of your solution is important, so it is important to analyze it carefully and make sure it is within the time limit.
5. **Incorrect memory usage.** The memory usage of your solution is also important, so it is important to make sure it does not exceed the memory limit.

**Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement:** A developer may think that the problem is asking them to find the minimum number of swaps that need to be performed to make the array sorted, when in reality it is asking them to find the minimum number of swaps that need to be performed to make the array so that no neighboring numbers have the same parity.
* **Incorrect implementation of the solution:** A developer may implement a solution that works for some test cases but not for others. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a bug in the code, or a misunderstanding of the problem statement.
* **Incorrect test cases:** A developer may write test cases that do not test all of the possible cases. This could lead to the developer believing that their solution is correct when it is not.
* **Incorrect runtime analysis:** A developer may underestimate the time complexity of their solution. This could lead to their solution being rejected by the judge.
* **Incorrect memory usage:** A developer may use too much memory in their solution. This could lead to their solution being rejected by the judge.

CODEFORCES 1556_C. Compressed Bracket Sequence


Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data is a sequence of positive integers. So we should use `int` or `long long` to store the numbers. If we use `short` or `unsigned char`, the program may crash when encountering a large number.

**2. Off-by-one error**

In the problem statement, it is mentioned that `l ≤ r`. So we should make sure that `l <= r` in our code.

**3. Incorrect bracket matching**

In the problem statement, it is mentioned that a bracket sequence is regular if it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into this sequence. So we should make sure that the bracket sequence is correctly matched.

**4. Incorrect calculation**

The problem asks us to find the total number of subsegments of the original bracket sequence, which are regular bracket sequences. So we should calculate the number of subsegments correctly.

**5. Runtime error**

We should make sure that our code runs within the time limit. One way to do this is to use a faster algorithm. Another way is to optimize the code.

CODEFORCES 1556_D. Take a Guess


Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake. For example, forgetting to put a space between two numbers, or putting a space in the middle of a number, will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect queries**. The queries must be in the correct format, and they must also be valid. For example, you cannot ask for the bitwise AND of two numbers that are not in the sequence, or you cannot ask for the bitwise OR of two numbers that are the same.
3. **Not flushing the output buffer**. This is a common mistake that can cause the program to crash. Make sure to flush the output buffer after each line of output, or you may get the "Idleness limit exceeded" error.
4. **Halting the program too early**. If you receive a response of -1, you must immediately halt your program. If you do not, you will get the "Incorrect answer" verdict.
5. **Not finding the k-th smallest number**. The goal of the problem is to find the k-th smallest number in the sequence. If you do not find the correct answer, you will get the "Wrong answer" verdict.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. Make sure you understand the input format and the rules for submitting queries.
2. Test your program with a few different inputs before submitting it to the judge.
3. Make sure to flush the output buffer after each line of output.
4. If you receive a response of -1, immediately halt your program.
5. Make sure you find the k-th smallest number in the sequence.

Test inputs:
```
# 1. Incorrect input format

n, k = map(int, input().split())
```

```
# 2. Incorrect queries

n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Ask for bitwise AND of two numbers that are not in the sequence

print("and 1 2")
```

```
# 3. Not flushing the output buffer

n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Ask for bitwise AND of two numbers

print("and 1 2")
# This will cause the program to crash because the output buffer is not flushed
```

```
# 4. Halting the program too early

n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Ask for bitwise AND of two numbers

print("and 1 2")

# Receive a response of -1

-1
```

```
# 5. Not finding the k-th smallest number

n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Ask for bitwise AND of two numbers

print("and 1 2")

# Receive a response of 2

# The correct answer is 1
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 1556_E. Equilibrium


Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect implementation of the balancing operation.** The balancing operation should increment the values of array `a` at positions `pos_1`, `pos_3`, `pos_5`, ... and the values of array `b` at positions `pos_2`, `pos_4`, `pos_6`, ... If this is not done, the values of the arrays will not be equalized and the output will be incorrect.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of balancing operations needed.** The number of balancing operations needed is equal to the absolute value of the difference between the sums of the values of the arrays in the segment. If this is not calculated correctly, the output will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement specifies that the segments must be of the form `l..r`, where `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l < r <= n`. If this condition is not met, the output should be `-1`.
4. **Incorrect handling of invalid input.** The problem statement specifies that the input should consist of integers that are non-negative and less than `10^9`. If the input contains invalid values, the output should be `-1`.

**Additional tips:**

* When implementing the balancing operation, it is helpful to use a temporary array to store the values of the arrays before and after the operation. This can help to avoid errors in calculating the sums of the values of the arrays.
* When calculating the number of balancing operations needed, it is helpful to use a prefix sum array to store the cumulative sums of the values of the arrays. This can help to speed up the calculation.
* When handling edge cases, it is helpful to use a simple condition check to determine whether the segment is valid. This can help to avoid errors in the output.
* When handling invalid input, it is helpful to use a simple error message to indicate the problem. This can help the user to identify the source of the error.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1556_F. Sports Betting


Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

1. **Incorrect calculation of the expected value.** The expected value of the number of winners is the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes, weighted by the number of winners in each outcome. For example, if there are two teams, A and B, and A wins with probability p and B wins with probability 1-p, then the expected value of the number of winners is p + (1-p) = 1.
2. **Incorrect handling of ties.** In the problem statement, it is not specified how to handle ties. If two teams are tied, then it is possible that both teams are considered winners, or that neither team is considered a winner. The correct way to handle ties depends on the specific problem.
3. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic.** When computing the expected value, it is important to use modulo arithmetic correctly. For example, if the expected value is 10 and the modulo is 7, then the correct answer is 3, not 10.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that can occur when counting or indexing. For example, if you are counting the number of elements in an array, you might accidentally miss the last element or count the first element twice.
5. **Incorrect use of recursion.** Recursion can be a powerful tool for solving problems, but it is important to use it correctly. For example, if you are using recursion to solve a problem, you need to make sure that the base case is handled correctly and that the recursive calls are made in the correct order.
6. **Incorrect use of dynamic programming.** Dynamic programming is a powerful technique for solving problems that can be broken down into subproblems. For example, if you are trying to find the longest increasing subsequence in a sequence of numbers, you can use dynamic programming to cache the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences of the prefixes of the sequence.
7. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The correct choice of data structure can make a big difference in the performance of your program. For example, if you are storing a large amount of data, you should use a data structure that is designed for efficient storage and retrieval.
8. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** The correct choice of algorithm can make a big difference in the performance of your program. For example, if you are sorting a large amount of data, you should use a sorting algorithm that is designed for efficient sorting.
9. **Incorrect use of libraries.** Libraries can be a great way to save time and effort, but it is important to use them correctly. For example, if you are using a library to solve a problem, you need to make sure that you understand the API and that you are using the library in the correct way.
10. **Incorrect use of unit tests.** Unit tests are a valuable tool for catching bugs early in the development process. However, it is important to write unit tests that are comprehensive and that test all of the important aspects of your code.

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if you forget to add a newline character at the end of the output, the program will not be able to write the output correctly.

**3. Incorrect data type**

The data type of the input and output values is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake when converting between data types. For example, if you try to compare a string to a number, the program will not be able to compare the two values correctly.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when you accidentally increment or decrement a variable by one too many or too few times. This can lead to incorrect results.

**5. Logic errors**

Logic errors are a type of bug that occurs when the program is not doing what you intended it to do. This can be caused by a number of things, such as using the wrong algorithm, or making a mistake in your logic.

**6. Undefined behavior**

Undefined behavior is a type of bug that occurs when the program does something that is not specified in the language specification. This can be caused by a number of things, such as using uninitialized memory, or accessing a memory location that is out of bounds.

**7. Memory leaks**

Memory leaks are a type of bug that occurs when the program does not free up memory that it is no longer using. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

**8. Race conditions**

Race conditions are a type of bug that occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.

**9. Deadlocks**

Deadlocks are a type of bug that occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can lead to the program running indefinitely or crashing.

**10. Security vulnerabilities**

Security vulnerabilities are a type of bug that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to a system. This can be caused by a number of things, such as using weak passwords, or not properly securing your code.

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not correctly parsed. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect data structure**. The data structure used to store the input data may be incorrect. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. The implementation of the algorithm may be incorrect. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
5. **Incorrect testing**. The program may not be tested thoroughly enough. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to use a correct algorithm and data structure to solve the problem. The implementation of the algorithm should be carefully checked to ensure that it is correct. Finally, the program should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it produces the correct output for all possible inputs.

Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect input format**

```

a 3 4 2 1
29 49 33 12 55 15 32 62 37
61 26 15 58 15 22 8 58
37 16 9 39 20 14 58

53 13 37 44 52
23 59 58 4
69 80 29
89 28
48
```

This input is incorrect because the first line should contain two integers n and k, but the first line contains the string "a".

2. **Incorrect algorithm**

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 51;
int n, k, d[maxn], w[maxn][maxn];
int ans = 1e9;
int dfs(int node, int cnt) {
    if (cnt == k) {
        int ret = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (cnt - d[i] > 0)
                ret += w[node][i];
        }
        ans = min(ans, ret);
        return ret;
    }
    int ret = 1e9;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (i != node && cnt - d[i] > 0) {
            ret = min(ret, dfs(i, cnt + 1) + w[node][i]);
        }
    }
    return ret;
}
int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cin >> n >> k;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        cin >> d[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            cin >> w[i][j];
        }
    }
    cout << dfs(0, 0) << endl;
}
```

This algorithm is incorrect because it does not consider the degree constraints of the first k vertices.

3. **Incorrect data structure**

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 51;
int n, k, d[maxn], w[maxn][maxn];
int ans = 1e9;
int dfs(int node, int cnt) {
    if (cnt == k) {
        int ret = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (cnt - d[i] > 0)
                ret += w[node][i];
        }
        ans = min(ans, ret);
        return ret;
    }
    int ret = 1e9;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (i != node && cnt - d[i] > 0) {
            ret = min(ret, dfs(i, cnt + 1) + w[node][i]);
        }
    }
    return ret;
}
int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cin >> n >> k;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        cin >> d[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            cin >> w[i][j];
        }
    }
    cout << dfs(0, 0) << endl;
}
```

This data structure is incorrect because it uses a 2D array to store the weights of the edges. This can lead to the program crashing if the input is large.



Title:
CODEFORCES 1557_A. Ezzat and Two Subsequences


Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input array can contain very large integers, so it is important to use the correct data type to store the elements. If you use a data type that is too small, you may get incorrect results.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The greedy algorithm works by iteratively adding the next largest element to the current subsequence until the subsequence is full. This algorithm will find the optimal solution in most cases.

**3. Making a mistake in the implementation**

The implementation of the greedy algorithm is relatively straightforward, but it is still possible to make mistakes. Be careful to check your work carefully before submitting your solution.

**4. Not handling special cases correctly**

The input array may contain special cases, such as an empty array or an array with all elements equal. It is important to handle these cases correctly in order to get the correct answer.

**5. Not using enough test cases**

It is important to test your solution on a variety of test cases in order to make sure that it works correctly. This will help you to catch any bugs in your code before submitting your solution.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1557_B. Moamen and k-subarrays


Pain points:
**1. The input format is incorrect.**

The input format should be `t` (number of test cases), followed by `n` and `k` (the number of elements in the array and the number of subarrays), followed by the array elements. However, the input format in the problem statement is incorrect. It should be `t n k a_1 a_2 ... a_n`.

**2. The output format is incorrect.**

The output format should be `YES` or `NO`. However, the output format in the problem statement is incorrect. It should be `yes` or `no`.

**3. The problem statement is unclear.**

The problem statement does not clearly define what it means for an array to be sorted in non-decreasing order. It is not clear whether the array elements must be strictly increasing or whether they can be equal.

**4. The problem is too difficult.**

The problem is very difficult to solve. It requires a deep understanding of sorting algorithms and data structures.

**5. The problem is not interesting.**

The problem is not very interesting. It is just a simple sorting problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1557_C. Moamen and XOR


Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the bitwise AND and XOR operations.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. Be sure to understand how these operations work before using them in your code.
2. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** When working with large numbers, it is important to be aware of the possibility of overflow. This can occur when the result of an arithmetic operation is larger than the type of the variable that is storing it. To avoid overflow, you can use the `unsigned` keyword to cast the result of the operation to a larger type, or you can use the `mod` operator to find the remainder of the division by the maximum value of the type.
3. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (`%`) returns the remainder of a division. This means that if you divide a number by another number and then take the modulo, you will get the same result as if you had simply subtracted the smaller number from the larger number. This can be a source of errors if you are not careful.
4. **Incorrect use of the factorial function.** The factorial function (`factorial(n)`) returns the product of all the numbers from 1 to n. This function can be used to calculate the number of ways to arrange a set of objects, or the number of permutations of a set of objects. However, it is important to be aware of the fact that the factorial function grows very quickly, and it can quickly overflow if you are not careful.
5. **Incorrect use of the binomial coefficient.** The binomial coefficient (`nCr`) gives the number of ways to choose r objects from a set of n objects. This function can be used to calculate the number of combinations of a set of objects, or the number of subsets of a set of objects. However, it is important to be aware of the fact that the binomial coefficient can also overflow if you are not careful.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these common problems:

* Use a good online reference to learn how the bitwise AND and XOR operations work.
* Be aware of the possibility of overflow when working with large numbers.
* Use the `unsigned` keyword to cast the result of an arithmetic operation to a larger type, or use the `mod` operator to find the remainder of the division by the maximum value of the type.
* Make sure you understand how the modulo operator works.
* Be careful when using the factorial function. Make sure you use a large enough type to avoid overflow.
* Be careful when using the binomial coefficient. Make sure you use a large enough type to avoid overflow.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1557_D. Ezzat and Grid


Pain points:

 The grid is not beautiful because the 2-nd row and the 3-rd row do not have a common 1. So we need to remove the 2-nd, 4-th and 5-th rows.
 **1. Using the wrong data type:**

The input data is of type `int`, but the output data is of type `long long`. This can lead to incorrect results if the input data is large.

**2. Using incorrect indexes:**

The input data is a 2D array, but the code uses a 1D array to store the data. This can lead to incorrect results if the input data is not properly aligned.

**3. Not handling edge cases:**

The code does not handle the case where the input data is empty or invalid. This can lead to incorrect results or a segmentation fault.

**4. Using inefficient algorithms:**

The code uses a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem. This can lead to a very slow runtime.

**5. Not using parallelization:**

The code is not parallelized, which can lead to a slow runtime on multi-core machines.

**6. Not using the right data structures:**

The code uses a hash table to store the data, but a more efficient data structure such as a binary search tree could be used.

**7. Not using the right algorithms:**

The code uses a greedy algorithm to solve the problem, but a more efficient algorithm such as a dynamic programming algorithm could be used.

**8. Not testing the code:**

The code was not tested thoroughly, which can lead to incorrect results or bugs.

CODEFORCES 1557_E. Assiut Chess


Pain points:
1. The queen is placed at (7, 5).
2. The king moves to (7, 7) (left).
3. The queen moves to (7, 6).
4. The king moves to (8, 7) (right).
5. The king has no valid moves and the game ends.

**Possible problems and bugs:**

1. **Incorrect queen placement.** The queen must be placed on a valid square on the chessboard. If the queen is placed on an invalid square, the game will terminate immediately and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.
2. **Invalid queen move.** The queen can only move to a valid square on the chessboard. If the queen tries to move to an invalid square, the game will terminate immediately and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.
3. **Too many queen moves.** You are only allowed to make at most 130 moves with the queen. If you try to make more than 130 moves, the game will terminate immediately and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.
4. **Not winning the game.** If the king still has valid moves after 130 moves of the queen, you will lose the game.
5. **Idleness limit exceeded.** If you do not print a query within the specified time limit, the game will terminate immediately and you will receive an Idleness limit exceeded verdict.

To avoid these problems, be sure to carefully read the problem statement and understand all of the rules. Make sure that your queen placement and moves are valid, and that you do not make more than 130 moves. Finally, be sure to print your queries within the specified time limit.

Here are some tips for solving this problem:

1. **Use a good chess engine to help you find the best moves for the queen.** There are many good chess engines available online, such as Stockfish and Komodo. These engines can help you find the best moves for the queen, even in difficult situations.
2. **Be patient.** The game of chess can be very challenging, and it may take some time to find the best moves for the queen. Don't get discouraged if you don't win the game immediately. Just keep practicing and you will eventually get better.
3. **Have fun!** Chess is a great game, and it's a lot of fun to play. So relax, enjoy the game, and see if you can beat the king!

Title:
CODEFORCES 1558_E. Down Below


Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrectly calculating the minimum power required to beat all the monsters.** This is a common mistake that can be made when the problem statement is not clear or the developer is not familiar with the concept of dynamic programming. To avoid this mistake, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the constraints on the input and output. It is also helpful to draw a diagram of the graph of caves and tunnels to visualize the problem.
2. **Using an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem.** There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem, but not all of them are efficient. The most efficient algorithm for this problem is dynamic programming. Dynamic programming works by storing the minimum power required to beat all the monsters in each cave, and then using this information to find the minimum power required to beat all the monsters in the entire graph.
3. **Incorrectly implementing the dynamic programming algorithm.** Dynamic programming algorithms can be difficult to implement correctly, especially if the developer is not familiar with the concept. To avoid this mistake, it is important to carefully read the pseudocode for the algorithm and understand how it works. It is also helpful to test the algorithm on small test cases before using it on the actual problem.
4. **Incorrectly handling the input data.** The input data for this problem can be difficult to parse correctly, especially if the data is not formatted correctly. To avoid this mistake, it is important to carefully read the input data and make sure that it is in the correct format. It is also helpful to use a tool like RegEx to validate the input data.
5. **Incorrectly handling the output data.** The output data for this problem can be difficult to format correctly, especially if the output is large. To avoid this mistake, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and make sure that the output is in the correct format. It is also helpful to use a tool like RegEx to validate the output data.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1559_A. Mocha and Math


Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the bitwise AND operation**

The bitwise AND operation is performed on two integers, and the result is the same as the bits that are set in both integers. For example, if `a = 0b1010` and `b = 0b0101`, then `a & b = 0b0000`.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing the bitwise AND operation is to use the `&` operator instead of the `&` operator. This will result in the incorrect output, because the `&` operator performs a bitwise AND operation on two bits, not two integers.

To correctly implement the bitwise AND operation, you can use the following code:

```
a & b
```

**2. Using the wrong data type for the input array**

The input array is a list of integers, so you need to use an integer data type to store the values in the array. If you use a floating-point data type, such as `float` or `double`, the values in the array will be rounded to the nearest floating-point number, which could lead to incorrect results.

To correctly store the values in the input array, you can use the following code:

```
int[] arr = new int[n];
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    arr[i] = Integer.parseInt(s.charAt(i) - '0');
}
```

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm to find the minimum value**

The minimum value in the input array is the smallest integer that appears in the array. To find the minimum value, you can use the following algorithm:

1. Initialize a variable `min` to the first value in the array.
2. Iterate through the rest of the array, and update `min` if a smaller value is found.
3. The final value of `min` is the minimum value in the array.

To correctly implement this algorithm, you can use the following code:

```
int min = arr[0];
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if (arr[i] < min) {
        min = arr[i];
    }
}
```

**4. Formatting the output incorrectly**

The output should be a single integer, which is the minimum value in the input array. To correctly format the output, you can use the following code:

```
System.out.println(min);
```

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain a space between two integers, or the input may contain a character that is not a letter or a digit.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the output may contain a space between two characters, or the output may contain a character that is not a letter or a digit.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the solution may be incorrect. For example, the solution may not find the optimal solution, or the solution may not be efficient.
4. **Runtime error**. The solution may not run correctly due to a runtime error. For example, the solution may run out of memory, or the solution may cause a segmentation fault.
5. **Memory leak**. The solution may leak memory. For example, the solution may create objects that are never deleted, or the solution may not free memory that is no longer needed.
6. **Security vulnerability**. The solution may contain a security vulnerability. For example, the solution may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, or the solution may allow an attacker to access sensitive data.

CODEFORCES 1559_C. Mocha and Hiking


Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format should be `t n a1 a2 ... an`. Make sure that you parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be `n+1 integers`, where the i-th number is the i-th village they will go through. Make sure that you format your output correctly.
3. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm you use to solve the problem may be incorrect. Make sure that your algorithm is correct.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** Make sure that you account for all cases, including the case where `n = 1`.
5. **Memory leaks.** Make sure that you free any memory that you allocate.
6. **Synchronization issues.** Make sure that your code is thread-safe if it is being run in a multi-threaded environment.
7. **Security vulnerabilities.** Make sure that your code is secure and does not allow attackers to exploit any vulnerabilities.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. A developer may incorrectly parse the input format and assume that the input is in the format `n a1 a2 ... an`. This would cause the developer to miss the first line of input, which contains the number of test cases `t`.
2. A developer may incorrectly format their output and print `n integers`, where the i-th number is the i-th village they will go through. This would cause the developer to miss the first village, which is always village `1`.
3. A developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the developer may try to find a path from village `1` to village `n+1` using a depth-first search algorithm. This would not work because there is no path from village `1` to village `n+1`.
4. A developer may make an off-by-one error and forget to account for the case where `n = 1`. This would cause the developer to print an incorrect answer for the test case where `n = 1`.
5. A developer may leak memory by not freeing the memory that they allocate. This could cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
6. A developer may have synchronization issues if they are running their code in a multi-threaded environment. This could cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
7. A developer may create a security vulnerability by not properly validating user input. This could allow an attacker to exploit the vulnerability and gain unauthorized access to the system.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correct. For example, the output may not have one integer, or the integer may not be in the correct range.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program is incorrect. For example, the program may not find the maximum number of edges that can be added, or the program may add edges that create cycles in the forest.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program may not release memory that it has allocated. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
5. **Race conditions**. The program may not be thread-safe. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may not be secure. This can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or its data.

CODEFORCES 1559_D2. Mocha and Diana (Hard Version)


Pain points:
**1. The input format is incorrect.**

The input format is `n, m_1, m_2`, followed by `m_1` lines of edges in Mocha's forest, followed by `m_2` lines of edges in Diana's forest. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.

**2. The output format is incorrect.**

The output format is `h`, followed by `h` lines of edges. If the output format is incorrect, the program will crash.

**3. The program does not consider all possible cases.**

For example, the program may not consider the case where the two forests are disconnected. In this case, the maximum number of edges that Mocha and Diana can add is 0.

**4. The program has a runtime error.**

For example, the program may use an unbounded amount of memory. In this case, the program will crash.

**5. The program has a logical error.**

For example, the program may output the wrong answer. In this case, the program will not crash, but it will not produce the correct output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1559_E. Mocha and Stars


Pain points:
 1. **Incorrect implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes**. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple but efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers less than a given integer. However, if it is not implemented correctly, it can lead to incorrect results. For example, the following code will incorrectly find the number 101 as a prime number:

```
def sieve(n):
    primes = [True] * n
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if primes[i]:
            for j in range(i * i, n, i):
                primes[j] = False
    return [i for i in range(2, n) if primes[i]]

print(sieve(101))
```

The correct implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes is as follows:

```
def sieve(n):
    primes = [True] * n
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if primes[i]:
            for j in range(i * i, n, i):
                primes[j] = False
    return [i for i in range(2, n) if primes[i]]

print(sieve(100))
```

2. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic**. Modulo arithmetic is a mathematical operation that returns the remainder of a division. It is often used to handle overflows and to ensure that the results of calculations are within a certain range. However, if it is not used correctly, it can lead to incorrect results. For example, the following code will incorrectly calculate the sum of the first 100 integers:

```
def sum_first_100_integers():
    return sum(range(1, 101))

print(sum_first_100_integers())
```

The correct implementation of the code is as follows:

```
def sum_first_100_integers():
    return sum(range(1, 101)) % 1000000007

print(sum_first_100_integers())
```

3. **Incorrect use of floating-point arithmetic**. Floating-point arithmetic is a method of representing real numbers in a computer. It is often used to perform calculations that involve decimals. However, floating-point arithmetic is not always accurate, and it can lead to incorrect results if it is not used correctly. For example, the following code will incorrectly calculate the square root of 2:

```
def sqrt_2():
    return math.sqrt(2)

print(sqrt_2())
```

The correct implementation of the code is as follows:

```
def sqrt_2():
    return math.sqrt(2) ** 0.5

print(sqrt_2())
```

4. **Incorrect use of recursion**. Recursion is a programming technique that allows a function to call itself. It is often used to solve problems that involve a hierarchy of objects. However, if it is not used correctly, it can lead to infinite loops and other errors. For example, the following code will create an infinite loop:

```
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(5))
```

The correct implementation of the code is as follows:

```
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(4))
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 1560_A. Dislike of Threes


Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer t, which is the number of test cases. If the input format is not followed, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that each test case should be output on a separate line, and that the output should be a single integer. If the output format is not followed, the program will not be able to correctly format the output and will produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be correct in order to correctly solve the problem. If the logic is incorrect, the program will not be able to find the correct answer and will produce incorrect output.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a programmer accidentally counts one too many or one too few times. This can lead to incorrect results being produced by the program.
5. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Synchronization errors**. Synchronization errors occur when multiple threads in a program try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to data corruption and incorrect results being produced by the program.
7. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads in a program try to access the same data at the same time and the outcome of the program depends on the order in which the threads access the data. This can lead to incorrect results being produced by the program.
8. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads in a program are waiting for each other to release a resource, and the situation cannot be resolved. This can lead to the program being stuck in an infinite loop.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1560_B. Who's Opposite?


Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) on the first line, followed by t test cases. Each test case should consist of one line containing three distinct integers a, b, c (1 ≤ a,b,c ≤ 10^8).
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer d — the number of the person being looked at by the person with the number c in a circle such that the person with the number a is looking at the person with the number b. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. Output -1 if there's no circle meeting the given conditions.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program should be correct. The program should find the number of the person being looked at by the person with the number c in a circle such that the person with the number a is looking at the person with the number b. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. Output -1 if there's no circle meeting the given conditions.
4. **Memory limit exceeded**. The program should not exceed the time and memory limits.
5. **Runtime error**. The program should not crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1560_C. Infinity Table


Pain points:
1. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm described in the problem statement is incorrect. For example, it would place the number 10 in the cell (2, 2) instead of (2, 1).
2. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer may accidentally use the wrong index when accessing the table. For example, they may try to access the cell (row, column) when the correct cell is actually (row - 1, column - 1).
3. **Boundary errors**. The developer may accidentally try to access a cell that is outside the bounds of the table. For example, they may try to access the cell (row, column) when row or column is less than 1 or greater than the number of rows or columns in the table.
4. **Data type errors**. The developer may accidentally use the wrong data type to store the values in the table. For example, they may use an integer to store a floating-point number or vice versa.
5. **Memory errors**. The developer may accidentally allocate too much or too little memory for the table. This can lead to errors such as segmentation faults or out-of-memory errors.
6. **Synchronization errors**. If multiple threads are accessing the table concurrently, the developer must take care to ensure that the table is properly synchronized. Otherwise, the results may be incorrect.
7. **Race conditions**. If multiple threads are trying to access the same cell in the table concurrently, the developer must take care to ensure that the results are consistent. Otherwise, the results may be incorrect.
8. **Deadlocks**. If multiple threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, the developer must take care to avoid deadlocks. Otherwise, the program may become stuck.
9. **Unhandled exceptions**. The developer must handle all possible exceptions that can be thrown by the program. Otherwise, the program may crash unexpectedly.
10. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer must take care to avoid any security vulnerabilities in the program. For example, they must ensure that the program is not vulnerable to buffer overflows or SQL injection attacks.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1560_D. Make a Power of Two


Pain points:

 In the eighth test case, you can add to the right the digit 0 — the number 12048 will turn into 120480 which is a power of 2.

In the ninth test case, you can add to the right the digit 8 — the number 1504 will turn into 15048 which is a power of 2.

In the tenth test case, you can add to the right the digit 0 — the number 6656 will turn into 66560 which is a power of 2.

In the eleventh test case, you can erase all the digits — the resulting number will be 0 which is a power of 2.

In the twelfth test case, you can erase all the digits — the resulting number will be 0 which is a power of 2.

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is `t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)`, followed by `t` test cases, each of which is a single integer `n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9)`. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output for this problem should be a single integer `m`, which is the minimum number of moves required to transform the input number `n` into a power of 2. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not produce the correct answer.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve this problem must be correct in order to produce the correct answer. A common mistake is to forget to consider the leading zeros in the input number. For example, if the input number is `001`, the algorithm should add one move to erase the leading zeros, even though the number is already a power of 2.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. Even if the algorithm is correct, the implementation of the algorithm must be correct in order to produce the correct answer. A common mistake is to make a typo in the code, which will cause the program to produce the wrong answer.
5. **Incorrect test cases**. The test cases used to test the program must be correct in order to ensure that the program is correct. A common mistake is to use test cases that are too easy or too difficult. The test cases should be challenging enough to test all of the different aspects of the program, but not so difficult that the program cannot solve them.
6. **Incorrect debugging**. If the program is not producing the correct answer, it is important to debug the program to find the source of the error. A common mistake is to debug the program in the wrong way. For example, if the program is crashing, it is important to debug the code that is causing the crash, rather than just trying to fix the error message.

For example, it is not clear what happens if the letter that is selected to be removed does not occur in the string s.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for solving this problem is not very straightforward, so it is important to implement it correctly. For example, it is important to correctly handle the case where the string s is empty.
3. **Incorrect testing.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly on all possible inputs. For example, you should test your solution on inputs with different lengths and with different characters.
4. **Incorrect submission.** It is important to make sure that your solution is submitted correctly. For example, you should make sure that your solution is in the correct format and that it does not contain any errors.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1560_F1. Nearest Beautiful Number (easy version)


Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input and output of this problem are integers. So we need to use the `int` data type to store the input and output values. If we use the wrong data type, such as `float`, the program will not work correctly.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The correct algorithm for this problem is to find the smallest multiple of 10 that is greater than or equal to n. However, if we use the wrong algorithm, such as using a brute-force approach, the program will not work correctly.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The logic for this problem is to find the smallest multiple of 10 that is greater than or equal to n. We can do this by first finding the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to n. Then, we can add 1 to this number to get the smallest multiple of 10 that is greater than or equal to n.

**4. Not handling corner cases correctly**

There are a few corner cases that we need to handle correctly in this problem. For example, if n is 0, the smallest multiple of 10 that is greater than or equal to n is 1. Additionally, if n is a multiple of 10, the smallest multiple of 10 that is greater than or equal to n is n.

**5. Not testing the program thoroughly**

It is important to test the program thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly. This includes testing the program with different input values, including boundary values and corner cases.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1560_F2. Nearest Beautiful Number (hard version)


Pain points:
The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are:

* **Incorrect implementation of the k-beautiful number algorithm.** The developer may incorrectly implement the algorithm for finding the k-beautiful number, resulting in an incorrect answer.
* **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The developer may incorrectly handle edge cases, such as when the input is invalid or when the k-beautiful number does not exist.
* **Insufficient testing.** The developer may not test their code sufficiently, resulting in bugs that are not caught until the code is deployed to production.

To avoid these problems, the developer should:

* Carefully implement the k-beautiful number algorithm.
* Thoroughly test their code with a variety of input values.
* Use a unit testing framework to help identify bugs.

By following these steps, the developer can help to ensure that their code is correct and that it produces the correct output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1561_A. Simply Strange Sort


Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong algorithm**

The algorithm described in the problem statement is not correct. It is possible for the permutation to never become sorted, even after an infinite number of iterations. For example, consider the permutation `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. This permutation is never sorted by the algorithm, because on every iteration, the algorithm only swaps elements that are adjacent to each other.

**2. Not handling the case where the permutation is already sorted**

The algorithm described in the problem statement does not handle the case where the permutation is already sorted. In this case, the algorithm will continue to iterate forever, never reaching the desired output.

**3. Using an incorrect data type**

The input and output of the problem are given as strings. However, the algorithm described in the problem statement requires the input and output to be integers. This can lead to errors if the input or output is not properly converted to the correct data type.

**4. Not handling the case where the input is invalid**

The problem statement does not specify what happens if the input is invalid. For example, what if the input is a negative number? Or what if the input is a string that does not contain any numbers? In these cases, the algorithm will likely crash or produce incorrect output.

**5. Not using enough test cases**

The problem statement does not specify how many test cases to use. This can lead to problems if the algorithm is not tested on enough different inputs. For example, the algorithm might work correctly on some inputs, but not on others.

**6. Not using a robust algorithm**

The algorithm described in the problem statement is not very robust. It is possible for the algorithm to get stuck in a loop, or to produce incorrect output. A more robust algorithm would be less likely to have these problems.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1561_B. Charmed by the Game


Pain points:
**1. Overflow**

The input contains integers that can be as large as 10^5. So we need to be careful about overflow. For example, if we add two integers that are both 10^5, the result will be 2 * 10^5, which is too large. To avoid overflow, we can use the following trick:

```
a + b = (a + b) % (10^9 + 7)
```

This will ensure that the result is always less than 10^9 + 7.

**2. Incorrect logic**

Another common mistake is to make a mistake in the logic of the algorithm. For example, in the following code, we are trying to find the maximum value of k such that k <= a + b and k is even:

```
max_k = 0
for i in range(a + b + 1):
    if i % 2 == 0 and i <= a + b:
        max_k = i
```

This code is incorrect because it does not consider the case where a + b is odd. In this case, the maximum value of k will be a + b - 1, which is odd.

To fix this, we can add the following line of code:

```
if a + b % 2 == 1:
    max_k = a + b - 1
```

This will ensure that the maximum value of k is always correct, even if a + b is odd.

**3. Using the wrong data type**

Another common mistake is to use the wrong data type. For example, if we are trying to find the maximum value of k such that k <= a + b, we should use an integer data type. If we use a floating-point data type, the result may be incorrect.

To avoid this problem, we should always use the correct data type for the problem we are solving.

**4. Not using the right algorithm**

The right algorithm for a problem can make a big difference in the running time. For example, the following algorithm for finding the maximum value of k such that k <= a + b and k is even is incorrect:

```
max_k = 0
for i in range(a + b + 1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        max_k = max(max_k, i)
```

This algorithm has a running time of O(a + b), which is too slow. A better algorithm would be to use binary search, which has a running time of O(log(a + b)).

**5. Not using memoization**

Memoization can be a very useful technique for speeding up an algorithm. For example, the following algorithm for finding the maximum value of k such that k <= a + b and k is even is incorrect:

```
def max_even_k(a, b):
    if a + b == 0:
        return 0
    elif a + b == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return max(max_even_k(a - 1, b), max_even_k(a, b - 1))
```

This algorithm has a running time of O(a + b), which is too slow. A better algorithm would be to use memoization, which would reduce the running time to O(a + b).

Title:
CODEFORCES 1561_C. Deep Down Below


Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect variable type

The input asks for an integer, but the code uses a string to store it. This will cause a type error.

```
t = input()
```

The correct code should be:

```
t = int(input())
```

### 2. Missing semicolon

The code is missing a semicolon after the `for` loop. This will cause a syntax error.

```
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

The correct code should be:

```
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

### 3. Uninitialized variable

The code uses the variable `i` without initializing it first. This will cause a runtime error.

```
for i in range(n):
    k = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

The correct code should be:

```
for i in range(n):
    k = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

### 4. Incorrect comparison operator

The code compares the variable `i` to the variable `n` using the `==` operator. This is incorrect, as the `==` operator tests for equality, not greater than.

```
if i == n:
    print(max(arr))
```

The correct code should be:

```
if i > n:
    print(max(arr))
```

### 5. Missing return statement

The code does not have a return statement at the end of the function. This will cause a runtime error.

```
def solve(n, arr):
    for i in range(n):
        k = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    return max(arr)
```

The correct code should be:

```
def solve(n, arr):
    for i in range(n):
        k = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    return max(arr)

t = int(input())

Title:
CODEFORCES 1561_D1. Up the Strip (simplified version)


Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect modulo**

When working with modulo arithmetic, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct modulo. In this problem, the modulo is m, so you must make sure that all of your calculations are done modulo m. For example, if you are adding two numbers together, you must make sure that the sum is less than m. If the sum is greater than m, you must subtract m from it until it is less than m.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm that you use to solve this problem is important. If you use an incorrect algorithm, you will not get the correct answer. For this problem, the correct algorithm is to use dynamic programming. Dynamic programming is a technique that allows you to store the results of subproblems so that you don't have to recompute them later. This can save you a lot of time and memory.

**3. Using incorrect data types**

The data types that you use can also affect the correctness of your code. For example, if you are using integers to store numbers that are larger than the maximum value of an integer, you will get incorrect results. In this problem, you should use long long integers to store the numbers n and m.

**4. Not handling special cases correctly**

There are a few special cases that you need to handle correctly in this problem. For example, if n is 1, then the answer is 1. You also need to handle the case where m is not a prime number.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it to the judge. This will help you to catch any errors that you may have made. You can test your code by using a small input and checking the output. You can also use a test generator to generate random inputs.

CODEFORCES 1561_D2. Up the Strip


Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulo operation.** When calculating the number of ways to move the token from cell n to cell 1, it is important to perform the modulo operation correctly. For example, if n = 10 and m = 11, then the number of ways to move the token from cell 10 to cell 1 is 10, not 11.
2. **Incorrect use of the factorial function.** The factorial function, denoted by n!, is the product of all the integers from 1 to n. For example, 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120. When calculating the number of ways to move the token from cell n to cell 1, it is important to use the factorial function correctly. For example, if n = 10, then the number of ways to move the token from cell 10 to cell 1 is (n - 1)! = 9! = 362880, not 10! = 3628800.
3. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator, denoted by %, returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 = 1. When calculating the number of ways to move the token from cell n to cell 1, it is important to use the modulo operator correctly. For example, if n = 10 and m = 11, then the number of ways to move the token from cell 10 to cell 1 is 10 % m = 10, not 11 % m = 10.
4. **Incorrect use of the exponentiation operator.** The exponentiation operator, denoted by ^, raises a number to a power. For example, 2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8. When calculating the number of ways to move the token from cell n to cell 1, it is important to use the exponentiation operator correctly. For example, if n = 10 and m = 11, then the number of ways to move the token from cell 10 to cell 1 is (n - 1)! ^ m = 9! ^ 11 = 29089604460649600, not 10! ^ m = 3628800 ^ 11 = 1303144237844799012000000.
5. **Incorrect use of the factorial function.** The factorial function, denoted by n!, is the product of all the integers from 1 to n. For example, 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120. When calculating the number of ways to move the token from cell n to cell 1, it is important to use the factorial function correctly. For example, if n = 10, then the number of ways to move the token from cell 10 to cell 1 is (n - 1)! = 9! = 362880, not 10! = 3628800.

CODEFORCES 1562_A. The Miracle and the Sleeper


Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is `1 2` instead of `1 2`, the program may incorrectly parse the input as `1 2 3`, which would lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values may not be correctly specified, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input values are specified as strings instead of integers, the program may incorrectly convert the strings to integers, which would lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the algorithm used to find the largest possible value of `a mod b` is incorrect, the program may output an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. The implementation of the algorithm may contain bugs, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the implementation of the algorithm does not correctly handle edge cases, the program may output an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect testing**. The testing of the program may not be comprehensive, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program is only tested on a few small test cases, it may not be able to find bugs that would only manifest themselves on larger test cases.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format, data types, algorithm, implementation, and testing of the program.

Pain points:
### Possible Problems

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be strictly followed. For example, if the input format specifies that the first line should contain two integers n and m, then the first line should contain exactly two integers separated by a single space. If the input format specifies that the second line should contain n ⋅ m integers, then the second line should contain exactly n ⋅ m integers separated by a single space.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format should be strictly followed. For example, if the output format specifies that the output should be a single integer, then the output should be exactly one integer.
3. **Incorrect data type**. The data types of the input and output should be strictly followed. For example, if the input format specifies that the first line should contain two integers n and m, then the first line should contain two integers, not strings or floating-point numbers.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that occurs when the programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. For example, if the programmer is iterating over a list of integers, and they forget to increment the index by one, then they will skip the last element in the list.
5. **Indexing errors**. Indexing errors occur when the programmer accesses an element of an array or list using an invalid index. For example, if the programmer tries to access the element at index 10 in an array that only has 9 elements, then they will get an error.
6. **Null pointer exceptions**. Null pointer exceptions occur when the programmer tries to access a variable that has not been initialized. For example, if the programmer tries to print the value of a variable that has not been assigned a value, then they will get a null pointer exception.
7. **ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException**. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs when the programmer tries to access an element of an array using an invalid index. For example, if the programmer tries to access the element at index 10 in an array that only has 9 elements, then they will get an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
8. **Arithmetic errors**. Arithmetic errors occur when the programmer performs an arithmetic operation incorrectly. For example, if the programmer tries to divide by zero, then they will get an arithmetic error.
9. **Logic errors**. Logic errors occur when the programmer makes a mistake in their logic. For example, if the programmer writes a program that is supposed to find the largest element in an array, but they accidentally write a program that finds the smallest element instead, then they will get a logic error.
10. **Runtime errors**. Runtime errors occur when the programmer's program crashes while it is running. For example, if the programmer's program runs out of memory, then it will crash.

CODEFORCES 1566_E. Buds Re-hanging


Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type.** The input data may be in a different format than expected, or it may contain invalid values. For example, a test case may contain a negative number of vertices, or it may contain a vertex that is not a leaf. If the input data is not in the correct format, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not be able to find all of the buds in the tree, or it may not be able to re-hang the buds to the correct vertices. If the algorithm is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect implementation.** The program may be incorrectly implemented, even if the algorithm is correct. For example, the program may not be able to correctly handle edge cases, or it may not be able to efficiently store and access the data. If the program is incorrectly implemented, it may crash or produce incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect testing.** The program may be incorrectly tested, even if the algorithm and implementation are correct. For example, the tests may not be comprehensive enough, or they may not be testing the correct aspects of the program. If the program is incorrectly tested, it may crash or produce incorrect output.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* **Be careful when reading the input data.** Make sure that you are correctly parsing the data and that you are not using invalid values.
* **Use a correct algorithm.** There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. Make sure that you are using an algorithm that is known to be correct.
* **Implement the algorithm carefully.** Make sure that you are correctly implementing the algorithm and that you are handling edge cases correctly.
* **Test the program thoroughly.** Write a comprehensive set of tests that cover all of the different aspects of the program. Make sure that the program passes all of the tests.

CODEFORCES 1566_F. Points Movement


Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the binary search algorithm.**

The binary search algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that can be used to find the position of a particular element in a sorted array. However, if the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results.

For example, the following code is an incorrect implementation of the binary search algorithm:

```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

This implementation is incorrect because it does not check for the case where the target element is not in the array. In this case, the algorithm will return -1, even if the target element is actually in the array.

To fix this problem, we can add the following check to the algorithm:

```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    # Check if the target element is not in the array.
    if left > right:
        return -1
```

**2. Using the wrong data structure.**

The data structure that you use to store your data can have a significant impact on the performance of your program. For example, if you are working with a large dataset, it is important to use a data structure that is designed for efficient access and retrieval of data.

One common mistake that developers make is to use a list to store data that is sorted. While lists are a good choice for storing unordered data, they are not as efficient for storing sorted data. This is because lists do not have any built-in methods for quickly finding the element at a particular index.

To avoid this problem, you should use a data structure that is specifically designed for storing sorted data. For example, you could use a binary search tree or a sorted array.

**3. Using inefficient algorithms.**

There are many different algorithms that can be used to solve a particular problem. However, not all algorithms are created equal. Some algorithms are more efficient than others.

When choosing an algorithm to solve a problem, it is important to consider the efficiency of the algorithm. If you choose an inefficient algorithm, it could lead to your program running slowly.

For example, the following code is an inefficient implementation of the bubble sort algorithm:

```
def bubble_sort(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
```

This implementation of bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), which means that it takes quadratic time to sort an array of size n.

A more efficient implementation of bubble sort can be achieved by using a two-pass algorithm. The first pass of the algorithm sorts the array from left to right, and the second pass sorts the array from right to left. This two-pass algorithm has a time complexity of O(n)

**4. Using too much memory.**

When writing a program, it is important to be aware of the amount of memory that your program is using. If your program uses too much memory, it could lead to your program running slowly or crashing.

There are a few things that you can do to reduce the amount of memory that your program uses. First, you can try to minimize the size of your data structures. Second, you can try to avoid using temporary variables. Third, you can try to use memory-efficient data types.

**5. Not handling errors correctly.**

It is important to handle errors correctly in your program. If you do not handle errors correctly, it could lead to your program crashing or producing incorrect results.

There are a few things that you can do to handle errors correctly. First, you can try to catch as many errors as possible. Second, you can try to provide informative error messages. Third

CODEFORCES 1566_G. Four Vertices


Pain points:
#### 1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is very specific. Make sure that you read and understand the input format carefully before starting to write your code.

#### 2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem is also very specific. Make sure that you read and understand the output format carefully before starting to write your code.

#### 3. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**. The algorithm that you implement to solve the problem must be correct. Make sure that you understand the algorithm and that you implement it correctly.

#### 4. **Incorrect runtime**. Your code must run in time that is within the time limit specified in the problem statement. Make sure that you optimize your code to run as fast as possible.

#### 5. **Incorrect memory usage**. Your code must not use more memory than the memory limit specified in the problem statement. Make sure that you optimize your code to use as little memory as possible.

#### 6. **Bugs**. Even if your code is correct and runs in time, it may still contain bugs that cause it to produce incorrect results. Make sure that you test your code thoroughly to catch any bugs that may be present.

Here are some specific examples of problems that you may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** You may accidentally read the input incorrectly, which will cause your code to crash or produce incorrect results. For example, you may accidentally read the number of vertices as a string instead of an integer, or you may accidentally read the edges in the wrong order.
* **Incorrect output format:** You may accidentally print the output in the wrong format, which will cause the judge to give you a wrong answer. For example, you may accidentally print the sum of the lengths of the shortest paths instead of the minimum sum of the lengths of the shortest paths.
* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm:** You may implement the algorithm incorrectly, which will cause your code to crash or produce incorrect results. For example, you may accidentally use the wrong data structure to store the edges of the graph, or you may accidentally use the wrong algorithm to find the shortest paths between pairs of vertices.
* **Incorrect runtime:** Your code may run in time that is too slow, which will cause the judge to give you a wrong answer. For example, you may use an inefficient algorithm to find the shortest paths between pairs of vertices, or you may use a data structure that takes too much time to construct.
* **Incorrect memory usage:** Your code may use more memory than the allowed limit, which will cause the judge to give you a wrong answer. For example, you may use a data structure that takes up too much memory, or you may accidentally allocate memory that you don't need.
* **Bugs:** Even if your code is correct and runs in time, it may still contain bugs that cause it to produce incorrect results. For example, you may accidentally use the wrong value in a calculation, or you may accidentally access a memory location that is out of bounds.

To avoid these problems, it is important to read and understand the problem statement carefully, test your code thoroughly, and use a debugger to track down any bugs that you find.

Pain points:
**1. ** **Incorrect variable type**. For example, if you are trying to iterate over a list of integers, but you accidentally type `for i in "string"`, you will get a `TypeError`.

**2. ** **Off-by-one errors**. These are errors that occur when you forget to increment or decrement a variable by one. For example, if you are trying to find the index of an element in a list, but you forget to subtract 1 from the index, you will get an `IndexError`.

**3. ** **Logic errors**. These are errors that occur when your code does not do what you intended it to do. For example, if you are trying to write a program to find the largest element in a list, but you accidentally compare the elements in the wrong order, you will get the wrong answer.

**4. ** **Memory errors**. These are errors that occur when your program runs out of memory. For example, if you are trying to create a very large list or array, you may run out of memory and your program will crash.

**5. ** **Security vulnerabilities**. These are errors that can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to your program or data. For example, if you are not properly sanitizing user input, an attacker could inject malicious code into your program and execute it on your system.

**6. ** **Performance problems**. These are errors that can cause your program to run slowly or inefficiently. For example, if you are not using the right data structures or algorithms, your program may run much slower than it needs to.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1567_E. Non-Decreasing Dilemma


Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data contains integers, so we need to use the correct data types to store them. For example, if we use `int` to store a number that is larger than `int`'s maximum value, we will get an overflow error.

**2. Using incorrect indexes**

When we iterate over an array, we need to make sure that the indexes are within the bounds of the array. Otherwise, we will get an out-of-bounds error.

**3. Using incorrect formulas**

When we write formulas to calculate the answer, we need to make sure that they are correct. Otherwise, we will get the wrong answer.

**4. Not handling corner cases**

The input data may contain corner cases, such as an empty array or an array with all elements equal to the same value. We need to make sure that our code handles these corner cases correctly.

**5. Not using efficient algorithms**

We can use efficient algorithms to solve this problem. For example, we can use a segment tree to find the number of non-decreasing subarrays in a given range.

**6. Not testing the code**

CODEFORCES 1569_A. Balanced Substring


Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of a's and b's in the substring.** This is the most common mistake, and it can be easily avoided by using a counter variable to keep track of the number of each letter.
2. **Not considering the case where there is no balanced substring.** This can happen if the string contains an odd number of letters, or if all of the letters are the same. In this case, the output should be -1 -1.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are a few different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem, but the most efficient one is the sliding window algorithm. This algorithm works by moving a window of size k across the string, and checking if the window is balanced. If it is, the output is the start and end indices of the window.
4. **Misunderstanding the problem statement.** It is important to make sure that you understand the problem statement before you start coding. This will help you avoid making mistakes.
5. **Not testing your code.** It is always important to test your code before you submit it. This will help you catch any bugs that you may have missed.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* **Use a counter variable to keep track of the number of a's and b's in the substring.** This will help you avoid incorrectly counting the number of each letter.
* **Consider the case where there is no balanced substring.** In this case, the output should be -1 -1.
* **Use the sliding window algorithm to solve the problem.** This is the most efficient algorithm for solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1569_B. Chess Tournament


Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is specified as follows:

```
The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 200) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the number of chess players.

The second line contains the string s (|s| = n; s_i ∈ \{1, 2\}). If s_i = 1, then the i-th player has expectations of the first type, otherwise of the second type.
```

A developer may encounter an incorrect input format if they do not follow the instructions carefully. For example, the following input is incorrect:

```
3
3
111
2
21
4
2122
```

The first line of the input contains three integers, but the second line only contains two characters. This is not a valid input format.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is specified as follows:

```
In the first line, print NO if it is impossible to meet the expectations of all players.

Otherwise, print YES, and the matrix of size n × n in the next n lines.

The matrix element in the i-th row and j-th column should be equal to:

  * +, if the i-th player won in a game against the j-th player; 
  * -, if the i-th player lost in a game against the j-th player; 
  * =, if the i-th and j-th players' game resulted in a draw; 
  * X, if i = j. 
```

A developer may encounter an incorrect output format if they do not follow the instructions carefully. For example, the following output is incorrect:

```
YES
X==
=X=
==X
```

The output should contain a matrix of size n × n, but the output above only contains three rows.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic of the solution is to find a way to assign wins and losses to the players such that all of them meet their expectations. For example, if there are three players, and the first two players have expectations of the first type, and the third player has expectations of the second type, then we can assign wins to the first two players and a draw to the third player. This way, all of the players meet their expectations.

A developer may encounter an incorrect logic if they do not properly consider all of the possible cases. For example, the following solution is incorrect:

```
def solve(n, s):
  # Check if it is possible to meet the expectations of all players.
  if sum(s) < n:
    return "NO"

  # Assign wins and losses to the players.
  for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
      if i != j:
        if s[i] == 1 and s[j] == 1:
          # The first player must win.
          return "NO"
        elif s[i] == 2 and s[j] == 2:
          # The second player must win.
          return "NO"

  # Return the solution.
  return "YES"
```

This solution does not consider the case where there are more than two players. In this case, it is possible to assign wins and losses to the players such that all of them meet their expectations.

**4. Runtime errors**

The solution may encounter runtime errors if it does not properly handle all of the possible cases. For example, the following solution may encounter a runtime error:

```
def solve(n, s):
  # Check if it is possible to meet the expectations of all players.
  if sum(s) < n:
    return "NO"

  # Assign wins and losses to the players.
  for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
      if i != j:
        if s[i] == 1 and s[j] == 1:
          # The first player must win.
          return "NO"
        elif s[i] == 2 and s[j] == 2:
          # The second player must win.
          return "NO"

  # Return the solution.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, tabs, or new lines. The developer should make sure to handle these cases correctly.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong data type. For example, a string may be interpreted as an integer, or an integer may be interpreted as a float. The developer should make sure to convert the input data to the correct data type.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are common in programming. For example, the developer may forget to add 1 to an index when iterating over a list. The developer should carefully check their code for off-by-one errors.
4. **Logic errors**. Logic errors are errors in the logic of the program. For example, the developer may incorrectly calculate the distance between two points. The developer should carefully check their code for logic errors.
5. **Memory errors**. Memory errors can occur when the program allocates too much or too little memory. The developer should carefully manage the memory usage of their program.
6. **Synchronization errors**. Synchronization errors can occur when multiple threads or processes access the same data at the same time. The developer should use appropriate synchronization mechanisms to avoid synchronization errors.
7. **Exception handling errors**. Exception handling errors can occur when the program encounters an unexpected error. The developer should handle exceptions gracefully to avoid crashes.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can occur when the program is not properly secured. The developer should take steps to secure their program against common attacks.
9. **Performance issues**. Performance issues can occur when the program is not efficient. The developer should profile their program to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the code accordingly.

**Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs That a Developer May Encounter When Solving This Problem**

1. **Incorrectly counting the number of good strings.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. To avoid this mistake, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the definition of a good string.
2. **Not considering all possible cases.** The problem statement states that the graph is simple and undirected. This means that there are no multiple edges or self-loops in the graph. Developers who forget to consider this case may get incorrect results.
3. **Using incorrect data structures or algorithms.** The problem statement does not specify the data structures or algorithms that should be used to solve the problem. Developers who choose the wrong data structures or algorithms may get incorrect results or run into time or memory limits.
4. **Making a programming error.** Even the most careful developers can make programming errors. To avoid this, it is important to carefully check your code for errors before submitting it.

Here are some specific examples of problems and bugs that developers may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly counting the number of good strings.** One common mistake that developers make is to count the number of good strings by simply multiplying the number of letters in the alphabet by the number of vertices in the graph. However, this is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the letters in the string must be used in a specific order.
* **Not considering all possible cases.** Another common mistake that developers make is to only consider the case where the graph is a complete graph. However, the problem statement states that the graph is simple and undirected, which means that it is not necessarily a complete graph. Developers who only consider the case where the graph is a complete graph may get incorrect results.
* **Using incorrect data structures or algorithms.** One common mistake that developers make is to use a data structure that is not suited for the problem. For example, developers may try to use a hash table to store the edges of the graph, but this is not a good idea because hash tables are not efficient for storing graphs with a lot of edges.
* **Making a programming error.** Even the most careful developers can make programming errors. One common error that developers make is to forget to check for errors when reading input from the user. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

By carefully avoiding these common problems and bugs, developers can increase their chances of successfully solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1572_B. Xor of 3


Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly. For example, if you forget to read the number of test cases, your code will not work on the second test case.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also very specific. It is important to make sure that you are printing the output in the correct format. For example, if you forget to put a space between the numbers in your output, the judge will not be able to understand your answer.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

This problem is a bit tricky because there are a lot of places where you can make off-by-one errors. For example, if you forget to add 1 to the index of the first element in your sequence of operations, your code will not work.

**4. Using the wrong data type**

This problem requires you to use the `int` data type to store the numbers in your sequence of operations. If you use the `long` data type, your code will not work correctly.

**5. Not handling all possible cases**

This problem has a few special cases that you need to handle. For example, what if the input is empty? What if the input contains all 0s? What if the input contains all 1s? Your code needs to be able to handle all of these cases.

**6. Using inefficient algorithms**

This problem can be solved in O(n) time. However, if you use an inefficient algorithm, your code will not be able to pass the time limit.

**7. Not debugging your code**

It is important to debug your code before submitting it to the judge. This will help you catch any errors in your code and make sure that it is correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1572_C. Paint


Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of connected components.** The problem states that "two pixels of the same color are considered connected if all the pixels between them have the same color as those two pixels". This means that if you have a group of pixels of the same color, and there is a single pixel of a different color in the middle of the group, then all of the pixels in the group are still considered to be connected. This can lead to you incorrectly counting the number of connected components, and therefore incorrectly calculating the minimum number of operations needed to make all the pixels have the same color.
2. **Not considering all possible colors.** The problem states that "for each color, the number of pixels of that color is at most 20". This means that you need to consider all possible colors, even if there are only a few pixels of that color in the image. If you only consider the most common colors, you may end up with a solution that is not optimal.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** The problem can be solved using a variety of different algorithms. However, not all algorithms are created equal. Some algorithms are more efficient than others, and some algorithms are more likely to find the optimal solution. It is important to choose an algorithm that is appropriate for the problem you are trying to solve.
4. **Incorrectly implementing the algorithm.** Even if you choose the correct algorithm, you still need to implement it correctly. This means that you need to make sure that you correctly understand the algorithm and that you correctly implement all of the steps. If you make a mistake in your implementation, you may end up with a solution that is incorrect.
5. **Not testing your solution.** It is important to test your solution to make sure that it is correct. This means that you need to generate a variety of test cases and make sure that your solution produces the correct output for each test case. If you do not test your solution, you may end up with a solution that is incorrect.

CODEFORCES 1572_E. Polygon


Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct.**

The input format is two integers n and k, followed by n lines of input, each line containing two integers x and y. However, the input format in the question is two integers n and k, followed by n lines of input, each line containing three integers x, y, and z. This will cause the program to crash.

**2. The output format is not correct.**

The output format is one integer, the maximum possible area of the smallest region after making k cuts multiplied by 2. However, the output format in the question is one integer, the maximum possible area of the smallest region after making k cuts. This will cause the program to output the wrong answer.

**3. The program does not handle the case where k is greater than n - 3.**

The question states that k is less than or equal to n - 3. However, the program does not check this condition, and will crash if k is greater than n - 3.

**4. The program does not handle the case where the polygon is not convex.**

The question states that the polygon is convex. However, the program does not check this condition, and will crash if the polygon is not convex.

**5. The program does not handle the case where two adjacent sides are parallel.**

The question states that no two adjacent sides are parallel. However, the program does not check this condition, and will crash if two adjacent sides are parallel.

CODEFORCES 1574_A. Regular Bracket Sequences


Pain points:
```
1. **Incorrect regular bracket sequences.** A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "1" and "+" between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences "()()" and "(())" are regular (the resulting expressions are: "(1)+(1)" and "((1+1)+1)"), and ")(", "(" and ")" are not.
2. **Not printing enough regular bracket sequences.** The problem statement requires you to print exactly n different regular bracket sequences of length 2n.
3. **Printing the same regular bracket sequence multiple times.** The problem statement requires that all the regular bracket sequences you output for a testcase should be different (though they may repeat in different test cases).
4. **Using incorrect characters in the regular bracket sequences.** The regular bracket sequences must only contain the characters "(" and ")".
5. **Incorrect formatting of the regular bracket sequences.** The regular bracket sequences must be printed on separate lines, and each regular bracket sequence must have exactly 2n characters.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. Make sure that you understand the definition of a regular bracket sequence.
2. Test your code on a few small examples before submitting it to the judge.
3. Use a debugger to help you track down any errors in your code.
4. Read the problem statement carefully and make sure that you understand all of the requirements.
5. Ask for help from a mentor or teacher if you are stuck.

CODEFORCES 1574_B. Combinatorics Homework


Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always followed correctly, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input is not a single integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect variable type**. The variables used in the program must be of the correct type. For example, if a variable is declared as an integer but is assigned a string value, the program may crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be correct. For example, if the program is supposed to find the maximum value in an array, but it instead finds the minimum value, the program will produce incorrect results.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Indexing errors**. Indexing errors occur when a programmer accesses an element of an array using an incorrect index. This can lead to incorrect results or a program crash.
6. **Null pointer exceptions**. Null pointer exceptions occur when a programmer attempts to access a null pointer. This can lead to a program crash.
7. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when a programmer allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to a program running out of memory and crashing.
8. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads attempt to access a shared resource at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or a program crash.
9. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, but neither thread can do so. This can lead to a program being stuck and unable to continue.
10. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities occur when a programmer makes a mistake that allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a system. This can lead to data theft, financial loss, or other serious consequences.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1574_C. Slay the Dragon


Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format of the problem is:

```
n
a_1, a_2, ..., a_n
m
x_1, y_1
x_2, y_2
...
x_m, y_m
```

where `n` is the number of heroes, `a_i` is the strength of the i-th hero, `m` is the number of dragons, and `x_i` and `y_i` are the defense and attack power of the i-th dragon.

A developer may incorrectly parse the input format and read the number of dragons as the number of heroes, or vice versa. This would result in an incorrect solution.

### 2. Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of coins

The minimum number of coins required to defeat a dragon is the sum of the following two values:

* The number of coins required to increase the strength of a hero to at least the dragon's defense.
* The number of coins required to increase the total strength of the heroes defending the castle to at least the dragon's attack power.

A developer may incorrectly calculate one or both of these values, resulting in an incorrect solution.

### 3. Incorrect output format

The output format of the problem is:

```
m
c_1
c_2
...
c_m
```

where `c_i` is the minimum number of coins required to defeat the i-th dragon.

A developer may incorrectly format the output, resulting in a compilation error or a runtime error.

### 4. Other bugs

In addition to the problems listed above, there are a number of other potential bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:

* Using incorrect data types for the input and output values.
* Using incorrect algorithms to calculate the minimum number of coins.
* Making incorrect assumptions about the input data.
* Not handling errors correctly.

By carefully considering the input format, the problem statement, and the output format, a developer can avoid these common problems and write a correct solution to the problem.

CODEFORCES 1574_D. The Strongest Build


Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input format is not clear. For example, it is not clear whether the items for each slot are listed in a single line or multiple lines.
* The output format is not clear. For example, it is not clear whether the output should be a single line or multiple lines.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if there are multiple builds with the maximum strength.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if there are no builds that are not banned.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input is invalid.

Here are some possible solutions to these problems and bugs:

* The input format can be made more clear by specifying that the items for each slot are listed in a single line.
* The output format can be made more clear by specifying that the output should be a single line.
* The problem statement can be made more clear by specifying that the output should be the build with the maximum strength that is not banned. If there are multiple builds with the maximum strength, any of them can be printed.
* The problem statement can be made more clear by specifying that the input should be valid. If the input is invalid, an error message should be printed.

Here is a possible solution to the problem:

```

Title:
CODEFORCES 1574_E. Coloring


Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving problems. It is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the exact steps that need to be taken in order to solve the problem. If the algorithm is not implemented correctly, the output will be incorrect.
2. **Using incorrect data types.** The data types used in the program must be appropriate for the problem. For example, if the problem requires counting the number of elements in a list, the data type of the list elements must be able to store non-negative integers. If an incorrect data type is used, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors occur when a developer accidentally misses or adds one element to a calculation. This can lead to incorrect results. For example, if a developer is counting the number of elements in a list, they may accidentally start counting at index 0 instead of index 1. This would result in the developer missing the first element in the list.
4. **Indexing errors.** Indexing errors occur when a developer accesses an element of an array or list using an incorrect index. This can lead to incorrect results or a program crash. For example, if a developer tries to access the element at index 10 of an array that only has 9 elements, the program will crash.
5. **Memory leaks.** Memory leaks occur when a developer allocates memory for a variable or object but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing. For example, if a developer creates a new object but never deletes it, the object will remain in memory until the program is terminated.
6. **Synchronization errors.** Synchronization errors occur when multiple threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or a program crash. For example, if two threads are both trying to update the value of a variable, the final value of the variable may be incorrect.
7. **Race conditions.** Race conditions occur when the outcome of a program depends on the order in which two or more threads execute. This can lead to incorrect results or a program crash. For example, if two threads are both trying to read the value of a variable, the final value of the variable may be incorrect depending on which thread reads the value first.
8. **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are each waiting for the other to release a resource. This can lead to the program being stuck in an infinite loop. For example, if two threads are each holding a lock on a different resource, neither thread will be able to release its lock and the program will be stuck in an infinite loop.
9. **Uncaught exceptions.** Uncaught exceptions occur when a program encounters an error that it cannot handle. This can lead to the program crashing or behaving in an unexpected way. For example, if a program tries to divide a number by zero, an uncaught exception will be thrown and the program will crash.
10. **Security vulnerabilities.** Security vulnerabilities occur when a program is susceptible to attack by malicious users. This can lead to the program being compromised or sensitive data being leaked. For example, if a program does not properly validate user input, a malicious user could input malicious code that could be executed by the program.

For example, if you were expecting the input to be a list of integers, but you accidentally read it as a list of strings, you would get incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer. It is important to make sure that you are formatting your output correctly, and that you are not accidentally printing out extra information.

For example, if you were to print out the number of occurrences of each element in the array, instead of just the total number of occurrences, you would get incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm that you use to solve this problem is very important. If you use an incorrect algorithm, you will get incorrect results.

For example, if you were to use a brute-force algorithm to solve this problem, you would not be able to solve it in time.

**4. Incorrect data structures**

The data structures that you use to solve this problem can also have a big impact on the performance of your code.

For example, if you were to use a linked list to store the occurrences of each element in the array, your code would be much slower than if you used a hash table.

**5. Incorrect implementation**

Even if you have the correct algorithm and data structures, you still need to implement your code correctly in order to get the correct results.

For example, if you were to make a mistake in your loop conditions, you would get incorrect results.

**6. Incorrect test cases**

It is important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. This means testing it with a variety of different input values, and making sure that it produces the correct results.

If you do not test your code thoroughly, you may not realize that there are any bugs in your code until it is too late.

Test inputs:
```
2 4 3
2 1 2
1 3

2 4 3
2 1 2
3 3 2 1

1 42 1337
2 13 31
