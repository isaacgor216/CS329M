CODECHEF a3

Pain points:
Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the output contains a character that is not a number, the program may crash.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic of the program may be incorrect, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program does not correctly check for all possible cases, it may give incorrect results.
* **Incorrect error handling:** The program may not handle errors correctly, which can lead to unexpected results. For example, if the program does not handle a divide-by-zero error correctly, it may crash.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format, output format, logic, and error handling of the program.

CODECHEF chefbm

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The input variables `n`, `m`, and `p` are all integers, but the code uses them as strings. This will cause errors when the values are not properly converted.
2. **Incorrect array size.** The code creates an array of size `n` to store the values of the matrix, but the input specifies that the matrix has `m` rows. This will cause errors when the code tries to access elements outside of the array bounds.
3. **Incorrect loop condition.** The code uses a `for` loop to iterate over the rows of the matrix, but the loop condition is incorrect. It should check that `i` is less than `n`, not less than or equal to `n`. This will cause the code to skip the last row of the matrix.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the cost of a move.** The code calculates the cost of a move as `aij - aij - 1`, but this is incorrect. The cost should be `aij - aij`. This will cause the code to incorrectly calculate the total cost of the moves.
5. **Incorrect output.** The code prints the total cost of the moves for each row, but it does not print a newline character after each row. This will cause the output to be a single, long line of text.

To fix these problems, you can do the following:

1. Change the variable type of `n`, `m`, and `p` to `int`.
2. Change the size of the array to `m`.
3. Correct the loop condition to check that `i` is less than `n`.
4. Correct the calculation of the cost of a move to be `aij - aij`.
5. Add a newline character after each row of output.

Title:
CODECHEF insoma4

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always strictly followed. For example, the input may contain a newline character instead of a space character between two numbers.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always strictly followed. For example, the output may contain a space character at the end of the line.
3. **Incorrect data**. The data may contain invalid values, such as a negative number or a string that is not a valid initials list.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The solution may not correctly find the longest ancestor list. For example, the solution may not consider all of the possible combinations of initials lists.
5. **Inefficient algorithm**. The solution may take a long time to run, even for small input sizes. For example, the solution may use a brute-force algorithm that checks every possible combination of initials lists.
6. **Memory leaks**. The solution may not properly free up memory after it is used, which can lead to a memory leak.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. The solution may not properly protect against malicious input, which can lead to a security vulnerability.

Title:
CODECHEF nf02

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain invalid characters, or the number of elements in each line may not be the same. The developer should check the input format and handle invalid input gracefully.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not always correct. For example, the output may contain non-numeric characters, or the output may not be the same as the expected output. The developer should check the output format and ensure that it is correct.
3. **Incorrect algorithm.** The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the developer may use a brute-force algorithm that takes a long time to run. The developer should use an efficient algorithm to solve the problem.
4. **Incorrect data structures.** The developer may use incorrect data structures to store the input data. For example, the developer may use a linked list to store the input data, which is not an efficient data structure for this problem. The developer should use an efficient data structure to store the input data.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The developer may not handle errors correctly. For example, the developer may not handle the case where the input data is invalid. The developer should handle errors correctly to ensure that the program does not crash.

Pain points:
**Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs That a Developer May Encounter When Solving This Problem:**

1. **Incorrectly using the comparison function.** The comparison function should be used to compare two combinations of numbers and determine which one is greater. It should not be used to compare two individual numbers.
2. **Not using the correct data structure.** The data structure used to store the combinations of numbers should be able to efficiently store and compare the combinations. A hash table or a sorted array would be a good choice.
3. **Not handling the edge cases correctly.** The edge cases to consider include when n is less than m, when m is 0, and when n is 1.
4. **Not generating all of the possible combinations.** The code should generate all of the possible combinations of numbers, not just a subset of them.
5. **Not printing the combinations in the correct order.** The combinations should be printed in increasing order, from smallest to largest.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1000_A. Codehorses T-shirts

Pain points:
1. The input format is not specified clearly. Does it contain one line with n, followed by n lines with a_i, followed by n lines with b_i? Or does it contain n lines with a_i and b_i interleaved?
2. The problem statement does not specify what happens if Ksenia changes a size to an invalid size. For example, if the previous year's list contains "XS" and the current year's list contains "XL", does Ksenia have to change "XS" to "L" or can she leave it as "XS"?
3. The problem statement does not specify what happens if Ksenia changes a size to a size that already exists in the list. For example, if the previous year's list contains "XS" and the current year's list contains "XS" and "XL", does Ksenia have to change "XS" to "L" or can she leave it as "XS"?
4. The problem statement does not specify what happens if Ksenia changes a size to a size that is not in the list. For example, if the previous year's list contains "XS" and the current year's list contains "L", does Ksenia have to change "XS" to "L" or can she leave it as "XS"?
5. The problem statement does not specify what happens if Ksenia changes a size to a size that is different from the size in the list, but is still a valid size. For example, if the previous year's list contains "XS" and the current year's list contains "S", does Ksenia have to change "XS" to "S" or can she leave it as "XS"?
6. The problem statement does not specify what happens if Ksenia changes a size to a size that is the same as the size in the list, but is in a different position. For example, if the previous year's list contains "XS" and the current year's list contains "XS", but the previous year's list has "XS" in the first position and the current year's list has "XS" in the second position, does Ksenia have to change the position of "XS" or can she leave it in the same position?
7. The problem statement does not specify what happens if Ksenia changes a size to a size that is the same as the size in the list, but is in the same position. For example, if the previous year's list contains "XS" and the current year's list contains "XS", both in the first position, does Ksenia have to change the size of "XS" or can she leave it as "XS"?

CODEFORCES 1025_B. Weakened Common Divisor

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format should be exactly as specified in the problem statement. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format should be exactly as specified in the problem statement. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be accepted by the judge.
3. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a bug in the algorithm, or using an algorithm that is not suited for the problem.
4. **Incorrect data structures.** The data structures used to solve the problem may be incorrect. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as using a data structure that is not suited for the problem, or using a data structure that is not implemented correctly.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The program should handle errors gracefully. This means that the program should not crash if an error occurs, and should instead print an appropriate error message.
6. **Incorrect performance.** The program should run in a reasonable amount of time. If the program takes too long to run, it will not be accepted by the judge.
7. **Incorrect memory usage.** The program should not use too much memory. If the program uses too much memory, it will not be accepted by the judge.
8. **Incorrect code style.** The code should be written in a clear and concise style. The code should be easy to read and understand, and should follow the style guidelines of the programming language being used.
9. **Incorrect comments.** The code should be well-commented. The comments should explain the purpose of the code, and should make it easy for other developers to understand the code.
10. **Incorrect unit tests.** The program should have unit tests. The unit tests should test the individual components of the program, and should ensure that the program is working correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1068_D. Array Without Local Maximums 

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is "1 2 3", the code may incorrectly parse it as "1, 2, 3" and assign the values 1, 2, and 3 to the variables a, b, and c, respectively. This would be incorrect because the input should be a single line of text with the numbers separated by spaces.
2. **Incorrect array bounds checking**. The code may not correctly check the bounds of the array, which can lead to errors such as accessing an element that is out of bounds or assigning a value to an element that is not initialized. For example, if the array has size 10, the code may incorrectly try to access the element at index 11.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of ways to restore the array**. The code may incorrectly calculate the number of ways to restore the array, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the code may incorrectly count the number of ways to restore the array if there are multiple possible values for a given element.
4. **Incorrect modulo arithmetic**. The code may incorrectly perform modulo arithmetic, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the code may incorrectly calculate the remainder of a division operation.
5. **Incorrect use of the 998244353 modulus**. The code may incorrectly use the 998244353 modulus, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the code may incorrectly add two numbers that are both divisible by 998244353.
6. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:
    * Using the wrong data type for a variable
    * Forgetting to initialize a variable
    * Using an incorrect algorithm
    * Making a logical error
    * Misunderstanding the problem statement

Title:
CODEFORCES 1090_C. New Year Presents

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible that the developer will misinterpret it and make a mistake. For example, the input may contain a line that does not start with an integer, or the number of presents in a box may be negative.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is possible that the developer will misinterpret it and make a mistake. For example, the output may not contain the correct number of lines, or the lines may not be in the correct order.
3. **Incorrect algorithm.** The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm that does not find the optimal solution to the problem. For example, the algorithm may not consider all possible moves, or it may not take into account the fact that the boxes must not contain two presents of the same kind.
4. **Incorrect data structures.** The developer may use incorrect data structures to store the input data or the intermediate results. This can lead to errors in the algorithm or to a waste of time and memory.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The developer may not handle errors correctly, which can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output. For example, the program may not handle the case where the input file does not exist or is corrupted.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully read the problem statement and the input format, and then implement a correct algorithm using appropriate data structures and error handling.

CODEFORCES 1157_C2. Increasing Subsequence (hard version)

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm.** The greedy algorithm for this problem is to always take the smallest element that is not yet in the increasing subsequence. However, if there are duplicate elements in the input, this algorithm may not find the longest increasing subsequence.
* **Incorrect handling of duplicate elements.** If there are duplicate elements in the input, it is important to make sure that the increasing subsequence only contains one copy of each element.
* **Incorrect handling of the end of the input.** The greedy algorithm for this problem will terminate when there are no more elements that can be added to the increasing subsequence. However, it is important to make sure that the increasing subsequence is still strictly increasing when it terminates.
* **Incorrect output format.** The output for this problem should be a single line containing the length of the longest increasing subsequence, followed by a second line containing a string of characters representing the moves that were made to find the longest increasing subsequence. The characters in the string should be 'L' for left moves and 'R' for right moves.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm:** The following code is an incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm for this problem:

```
def find_longest_increasing_subsequence(nums):
  """Finds the longest increasing subsequence in the given list of numbers.

  Args:
    nums: A list of numbers.

  Returns:
    A list of the numbers in the longest increasing subsequence.
  """

  subsequence = []
  for num in nums:
    if num > subsequence[-1]:
      subsequence.append(num)
  return subsequence

```

This code will not work correctly if there are duplicate elements in the input. For example, if the input is `[1, 2, 2]`, the output of this code will be `[1, 2]`, even though the longest increasing subsequence is `[1, 2, 2]`.

* **Incorrect handling of duplicate elements:** The following code is an incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm for this problem that handles duplicate elements incorrectly:

```
def find_longest_increasing_subsequence(nums):
  """Finds the longest increasing subsequence in the given list of numbers.

  Args:
    nums: A list of numbers.

  Returns:
    A list of the numbers in the longest increasing subsequence.
  """

  subsequence = []
  for num in nums:
    if num not in subsequence:
      subsequence.append(num)
  return subsequence

```

This code will not work correctly if there are duplicate elements in the input. For example, if the input is `[1, 2, 2]`, the output of this code will be `[1, 2]`, even though the longest increasing subsequence is `[1, 2, 2]`.

* **Incorrect handling of the end of the input:** The following code is an incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm for this problem that does not handle the end of the input correctly:

```
def find_longest_increasing_subsequence(nums):
  """Finds the longest increasing subsequence in the given list of numbers.

  Args:
    nums: A list of numbers.

  Returns:
    A list of the numbers in the longest increasing subsequence.
  """

  subsequence = []
  for num in nums:
    if num > subsequence[-1]:
      subsequence.append(num)
  return subsequence

```

This code will not work correctly if the input list is empty. For example, if the input is `[]`, the output of this code will be `[]`, even though the longest increasing subsequence is `[]`.

* **Incorrect output format:** The following code is an incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm for this problem that does not output the results in the correct format:

```
def find_longest_increasing_subsequence(nums):
  """Finds the longest increasing subsequence in the given list of numbers.

  Args:
    nums: A list of numbers.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1198_A. MP3

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input contains two integers n and I, which represent the length of the array and the size of the disk in bytes, respectively. However, the code below assumes that n and I are strings. This will cause a ValueError when the input is not in the correct format.

```
n, I = input().split()
```

To fix this, we can use the int() function to convert n and I to integers.

```
n, I = int(input()), int(input())
```

**2. Incorrect calculation of the number of bits**

The code below calculates the number of bits required to store the array as follows:

```
bits = n * math.ceil(math.log2(max(a)))
```

However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the array may contain duplicate values. To fix this, we can use the set() function to create a set of all the unique values in the array. Then, we can calculate the number of bits required to store the set as follows:

```
bits = len(set(a)) * math.ceil(math.log2(max(set(a))))
```

**3. Incorrect comparison of the number of bits and the size of the disk**

The code below compares the number of bits required to store the array with the size of the disk and prints the minimum number of changed elements. However, this comparison is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the array may contain duplicate values. To fix this, we can use the set() function to create a set of all the unique values in the array. Then, we can compare the number of bits required to store the set with the size of the disk.

```
if bits <= I:
    print(0)
else:
    print(len(set(a)) - len(a))
```

**4. Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of changed elements**

The code below calculates the minimum number of changed elements as follows:

```
print(len(set(a)) - len(a))
```

However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the array may contain duplicate values. To fix this, we can use the set() function to create a set of all the unique values in the array. Then, we can calculate the minimum number of changed elements as follows:

```
min_changes = 0
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] not in set(a):
        min_changes += 1
print(min_changes)

CODEFORCES 1256_C. Platforms Jumping

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is:

```
n m d
c_1 c_2 ... c_m
```

where:

* `n` is the width of the river
* `m` is the number of platforms
* `d` is the maximum distance of your jump
* `c_1`, `c_2`, ..., `c_m` are the lengths of the platforms

If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce an incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is:

```
YES
a_1 a_2 ... a_n
```

where:

* `YES` is a boolean value indicating whether it is possible to reach n+1 from 0
* `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` are the indices of the platforms to which the cells of the river belong

If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the output and will produce an incorrect result.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the maximum distance**

The maximum distance that you can jump is `d`. However, you cannot jump to a cell that is not on a platform. So, the maximum distance that you can actually jump is the minimum of `d` and the length of the platform that is closest to the cell that you are currently on.

**4. Incorrect calculation of the reachable cells**

The reachable cells are the cells that you can reach by jumping from the current cell. The reachable cells are the cells that are on the same platform as the current cell, or that are adjacent to a cell on the same platform as the current cell.

**5. Incorrect calculation of the shortest path**

The shortest path from 0 to n+1 is the path that takes the least number of jumps. The shortest path is the path that consists of the fewest number of cells that are not on a platform.

**6. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The algorithm for solving this problem is fairly simple. However, there are a few details that can be easily overlooked. For example, you need to make sure that you are not jumping to a cell that is already on the path. You also need to make sure that you are not jumping to a cell that is not on a platform.

**7. Incorrect testing**

It is important to test your program thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. You should test your program on a variety of input values, including invalid input values. You should also test your program on different platforms to make sure that it is portable.
Test inputs:
**1. Incorrect input format**

```
n m d
c_1 c_2 ... c_m
```

where:

* `n` is the width of the river
* `m` is the number of platforms
* `d` is the maximum distance of your jump
* `c_1`, `c_2`, ..., `c_m` are the lengths of the platforms

**2. Incorrect output format**

```
YES
a_1 a_2 ... a_n
```

where:

* `YES` is a boolean value indicating whether it is possible to reach n+1 from 0
* `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` are the indices of the platforms to which the cells of the river belong

**3. Incorrect calculation of the maximum distance**

```
d = min(n, d)
```

**4. Incorrect calculation of the reachable cells**

```
reachable_cells = {cell for cell in range(n + 2) if cell in platforms}
```

**5. Incorrect calculation of the shortest path**

```
shortest_path = [0]
for cell in range(1, n + 1):
    if cell not in reachable_cells:
        shortest_path.append(cell)

```

**6. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

```
def jump(cell, path):
    if cell == n + 1:
        return path

    for next_cell in reachable_cells[cell]:
        if next_cell not in path:
            path.append(next_cell)
            return jump(next_cell, path)

    return None

```

**7. Incorrect testing**

```
def test_jump():
    # Test case 1
    n = 7
    m = 3
    d = 2
    platforms = [1, 2, 1]

Title:
CODEFORCES 12_B. Correct Solution?

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n without leading zeroes. However, a developer may accidentally input a number with leading zeroes, or a non-integer value. This will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the program should print the string "OK" if Bob's answer is correct, and the string "WRONG_ANSWER" otherwise. However, a developer may accidentally print the wrong string, or may not print anything at all. This will cause the program to receive a incorrect verdict.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program should be to sort the digits of the input number n in ascending order, and then print the resulting number without leading zeroes. However, a developer may accidentally use the wrong sorting algorithm, or may not sort the digits at all. This will cause the program to output an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect error handling**. The program should handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input format is incorrect, the program should print an error message and exit. If Bob's answer is incorrect, the program should print the string "WRONG_ANSWER". However, a developer may accidentally ignore errors, or may print incorrect error messages. This will cause the program to behave incorrectly.
5. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other potential bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the program may not be able to handle large numbers, or it may not be able to allocate enough memory. These bugs can be difficult to find and fix, so it is important to test the program thoroughly before submitting it.

CODEFORCES 1342_C. Yet Another Counting Problem

Pain points:
1 1
 1 1
 1 1

1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement is not very clear, so it is important to make sure that you understand what is being asked. In this problem, we are given two integers a and b, and q queries. The i-th query consists of two numbers l_i and r_i, and the answer to it is the number of integers x such that l_i ≤ x ≤ r_i, and ((x mod a) mod b) ≠ ((x mod b) mod a). This means that we need to count the number of integers x in the range [l_i, r_i] such that the remainder of x divided by a is not equal to the remainder of x divided by b.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution to this problem is not very difficult, but it is important to make sure that you implement it correctly. One common mistake is to forget to take into account the fact that the remainder of a negative number divided by a positive number is always the same as the remainder of the absolute value of the negative number divided by the positive number. For example, the remainder of -10 divided by 5 is the same as the remainder of 10 divided by 5, which is 1.
3. **Incorrect test cases.** It is important to test your solution with a variety of test cases, including some that are intentionally designed to be difficult. This will help you to catch any bugs in your code.
4. **Incorrect debugging.** If your solution is not working, it is important to be able to debug it effectively. This means being able to identify the source of the error and then fix it. One helpful technique is to print out the values of key variables at each step of your program. This can help you to see where the error is occurring.
5. **Incorrect submission.** Once you have a working solution, it is important to submit it correctly. This means making sure that you follow the instructions on the contest website and that you include all of the required files.

CODEFORCES 1364_C. Ehab and Prefix MEXs

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect array definition.** The input array `a` should be of length `n`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
2. **Incorrect MEX calculation.** The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the set. This means that the MEX of the set `[1, 2, 3]` is `0`, because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the set.
3. **Incorrect output.** The output should be a single line containing `n` integers, where the `i`th integer is the MEX of the prefix of `a` up to the `i`th element. For example, if `a = [1, 2, 3]`, the output should be `[0, 1, 2]`.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** Be careful not to make off-by-one errors when calculating the MEX of a set of integers or when iterating over the input array.
5. **Incorrect use of pointers.** Be careful not to misuse pointers when passing arguments to functions or when accessing elements of the input array.
6. **Memory leaks.** Make sure to free any dynamically allocated memory after you are finished with it.
7. **Incorrect variable initialization.** Make sure to initialize all variables before using them.
8. **Incorrect data type conversions.** Make sure to convert data types correctly when performing operations on them.
9. **Logical errors.** Make sure to check for all possible errors and handle them appropriately.

3. **Using incorrect data structures or algorithms.** The problem can be solved efficiently using data structures such as arrays and sets. Make sure that you are using the correct data structures and algorithms for the problem.
4. **Making a programming error.** This is the most common type of bug that you will encounter when solving a programming problem. Make sure that you carefully check your code for errors before submitting it.
5. **Not testing your code.** It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that you may encounter when solving this problem:

* You may incorrectly handle the case where the input is empty. For example, you may try to access an element of the array at index 0, which would cause a runtime error.
* You may incorrectly implement the game rules. For example, you may forget to xor the current score with the chosen element when updating the score.
* You may use an incorrect data structure or algorithm. For example, you may use a linked list to store the elements of the array, which would be inefficient.
* You may make a programming error. For example, you may forget to close a bracket or you may mistype a variable name.
* You may not test your code thoroughly. For example, you may only test your code on a few small inputs, which would not catch all of the bugs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1473_G. Tiles

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data contains a lot of integers. If you use an integer type with a small range, such as `int`, you may get an overflow error. For example, the following code will get an overflow error:

```
n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
```

To avoid this problem, you can use a larger integer type, such as `long` or `int64`.

**2. Using the wrong modulo**

The output should be a number modulo 998244353. If you use the wrong modulo, your answer will be wrong. For example, the following code will get the wrong answer:

```
n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    print(a + b)
```

To avoid this problem, you should use the correct modulo in your code.

**3. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The following code uses a wrong algorithm and gets the wrong answer:

```
n = int(input())
dp = [[0] * (10 ** 5 + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
dp[0][1] = 1
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    for j in range(1, 10 ** 5 + 1):
        dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j + 1]) % 998244353
print(dp[n][1])
```

The correct algorithm is as follows:

```
n = int(input())
dp = [[0] * (10 ** 5 + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
dp[0][1] = 1
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    for j in range(1, 10 ** 5 + 1):
        dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j + 1]) % 998244353
print(dp[n][1])
```

**4. Not handling the edge cases**

The problem statement mentions that the sequence of a_i and b_i never results in a row with non-positive number of tiles. You should make sure that your code handles this edge case correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 149_B. Martian Clock

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input string may contain invalid characters. For example, it may contain a character that is not a digit or a letter.
* The input string may not be in the correct format. For example, it may not have the correct number of characters.
* The input string may represent a time that is not valid. For example, it may represent a time that is less than 0 or greater than 24:00.
* The input string may represent a time that can be represented in multiple numeral systems. For example, the string "11:20" can be represented in the ternary numeral system or the hexadecimal numeral system.
* The input string may represent a time that can be represented in an infinite number of numeral systems. For example, the string "000B:00001" can be represented in any numeral system with a radix of at least 12.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input string for validity. If the input string is invalid, the developer should return an appropriate error message. If the input string is valid, the developer should use a correct algorithm to find all of the numeral systems that can represent the time. The developer should also make sure to return the radixes of the numeral systems in the correct order.

CODEFORCES 177_C1. Party

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input format specifies that the number of acquaintances `n` should be an integer. However, if the input contains a non-integer value for `n`, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect data format**

The input format specifies that the pairs of friends and the pairs of people who dislike each other should be given in the format `ui vi`, where `ui` and `vi` are integers. However, if the input contains a pair of values that are not integers, the program will crash.

**3. Off-by-one error**

When computing the number of people who can be invited to the party, it is important to make sure that you don't count the same person twice. For example, if the input contains the following pairs of friends: `1 2`, `2 3`, `3 1`, then the number of people who can be invited to the party is 2, not 3.

**4. Incomplete solution**

The program should output the maximum number of people that can be invited to the party. However, if the program does not output anything, or if it outputs an incorrect value, then it is considered to be an incomplete solution.

**5. Runtime error**

The program should run in a reasonable amount of time. If the program takes too long to run, it will be considered to be a runtime error.

Title:
CODEFORCES 388_C. Fox and Card Game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly handling the input data.** The input data may contain invalid values, such as negative integers or strings. The developer should make sure to handle these cases correctly.
2. **Not considering all possible cases.** The problem statement may not explicitly state all of the possible cases, so it is important for the developer to think carefully about all of the possible ways that the problem can be solved.
3. **Making a mistake in the implementation.** The developer may make a mistake in the implementation of their algorithm, such as a logic error or a typo. It is important to carefully check the code for errors before submitting it.
4. **Not using efficient algorithms.** The developer may use an inefficient algorithm to solve the problem, which could lead to a time limit exceeded error. It is important to use efficient algorithms whenever possible.
5. **Not debugging the code.** The developer may not debug the code thoroughly enough, which could lead to errors that are not caught until the code is run on the test cases. It is important to debug the code carefully to ensure that it is working correctly.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer may incorrectly assume that the input data is always valid. For example, they may assume that all of the integers in the input data are positive, when in fact they could be negative.
* The developer may not consider all of the possible cases. For example, they may assume that the piles are always sorted in ascending order, when in fact they could be sorted in any order.
* The developer may make a mistake in the implementation of their algorithm. For example, they may forget to update a variable when it should be updated.
* The developer may use an inefficient algorithm to solve the problem. For example, they may use a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem, when there is a more efficient algorithm available.
* The developer may not debug the code thoroughly enough. For example, they may not test the code on all of the possible input cases.

By being aware of these potential problems, developers can avoid them and write code that is correct, efficient, and debugged.

Title:
CODEFORCES 409_A. The Great Game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be two strings of equal length, but the developer may accidentally mistype the input or forget to enclose the strings in quotes. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect string comparison.** The developer may compare the strings incorrectly, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer might compare the strings using the `==` operator, which would only check if the strings are equal in length, not if they contain the same characters.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The developer may implement the logic incorrectly, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer might forget to check if the strings are equal in length before comparing them.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** The developer may make an off-by-one error when counting the number of characters in the strings, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer might count the first character of the first string as the first character of the second string, which would cause the two strings to be considered equal even if they are not.
5. **Other bugs.** There are many other possible bugs that a developer could encounter when solving this problem, such as memory leaks, race conditions, and deadlocks. It is important to be aware of these potential problems and to take steps to avoid them.

CODEFORCES 436_B. Om Nom and Spiders

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem statement is quite long and detailed, so it is important to read it carefully and make sure that you understand all the requirements. For example, it is important to note that Om Nom starts walking at time 0, and that he only moves down the field.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution to this problem involves a lot of different moving parts, so it is important to make sure that you implement it correctly. For example, you need to make sure that you correctly track the movement of the spiders and that you correctly calculate the number of spiders that Om Nom will see.
3. **Incorrect testing of the solution.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. This can be done by generating a variety of test cases and checking that your solution produces the correct output.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly counting the number of spiders.** One common mistake is to incorrectly count the number of spiders that Om Nom will see. For example, you might forget to include the spiders that are already in the cell that Om Nom starts in, or you might double-count the spiders that are in the same cell as Om Nom.
* **Incorrectly tracking the movement of the spiders.** Another common mistake is to incorrectly track the movement of the spiders. For example, you might forget to update the position of the spiders when they move, or you might incorrectly calculate the direction in which the spiders are moving.
* **Incorrectly handling the edge cases.** The problem statement contains a few edge cases that you need to be aware of. For example, what happens if Om Nom starts in a cell that is next to a wall? What happens if there are no spiders in the park?

By being aware of these potential problems and bugs, you can increase your chances of solving this problem correctly.

CODEFORCES 505_B. Mr. Kitayuta's Colorful Graph

Pain points:
 * So the answer to the first query is 2, the answer to the second query is 1, and the answer to the third query is 0.  **1. Using an incorrect data structure**

The first problem that a developer might encounter is using an incorrect data structure to store the graph. For example, using an array to store the graph would be incorrect, as it would not be able to represent the edges of the graph correctly.

**2. Not handling duplicate edges correctly**

Another problem that a developer might encounter is not handling duplicate edges correctly. For example, if the graph contains two edges that connect the same two vertices, the developer might incorrectly count both edges as connecting the two vertices.

**3. Not handling disconnected components correctly**

A third problem that a developer might encounter is not handling disconnected components correctly. For example, if the graph contains two disconnected components, the developer might incorrectly count the number of edges that connect the two components.

**4. Not handling queries correctly**

A fourth problem that a developer might encounter is not handling queries correctly. For example, if the query asks for the number of edges that connect two vertices that are not in the graph, the developer might incorrectly return a value.

**5. Not handling errors correctly**

A fifth problem that a developer might encounter is not handling errors correctly. For example, if the input is malformed, the developer might incorrectly crash the program or return an incorrect value.

2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a string of opening and closing brackets. If the output is not a valid string, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The program should find the lexicographically smallest correct bracket sequence. If the program does not find the correct sequence, or if it finds the wrong sequence, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** The program should count the number of opening and closing brackets correctly. If the program counts the brackets incorrectly, the output will be incorrect.
5. **Memory leaks.** The program should not allocate any memory that it does not need. If the program allocates memory that it does not need, the program will eventually run out of memory and crash.
6. **Race conditions.** The program should not access shared data without synchronization. If the program accesses shared data without synchronization, the program may produce incorrect results.
7. **Deadlocks.** The program should not create any deadlocks. If the program creates a deadlock, the program will hang indefinitely.

Title:
CODEFORCES 554_C. Kyoya and Colored Balls

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type**

The input specifies that the number of balls in the bag does not exceed 1000. However, the output specifies that the answer should be modulo 1000000007. This means that we need to use a data type that can store numbers up to 109. If we use an incorrect data type, such as an integer, we may overflow and get an incorrect answer.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The correct algorithm for this problem is to use dynamic programming. We can create a table T[i][j] where T[i][j] represents the number of ways to draw the last ball of color i before drawing the last ball of color j. We can then fill in the table in a bottom-up fashion.

**3. Making a mistake in the implementation**

Once we have the correct algorithm, we need to implement it correctly. This means that we need to pay attention to details such as variable initialization, boundary conditions, and loop invariants.

**4. Not handling corner cases**

The input for this problem may contain corner cases, such as a bag with no balls or a bag with only one ball. We need to make sure that our algorithm handles these corner cases correctly.

**5. Using incorrect math**

The output for this problem is modulo 1000000007. This means that we need to be careful when doing arithmetic operations. For example, we cannot simply add two numbers without first reducing them modulo 1000000007.

**6. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it to the judge. This will help you catch any errors in your algorithm or implementation. You can test your code on a small set of input data or use a test harness.

CODEFORCES 624_D. Array GCD

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a number greater than 10^9, it will be interpreted as an integer, not a string, and the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values must be correct. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program will crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are common when programming with arrays. For example, if you are iterating over an array, you might accidentally access the element at index n+1 instead of index n. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be correct. For example, if you are trying to find the minimum value in an array, you must make sure to check all of the elements in the array.
5. **Uninitialized variables**. Uninitialized variables can lead to incorrect results. For example, if you declare a variable but do not initialize it, the variable will contain garbage data, which can lead to incorrect results.
6. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks can occur when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
7. **Race conditions**. Race conditions can occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even the program crashing.
8. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can prevent the program from making any progress and eventually crash.

CODEFORCES 64_A. Factorial

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is specified as "The only line contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10)". If the input format is incorrect, the program may crash or output incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of factorial**. The factorial of a number n is equal to 1 * 2 * ... * n. If the calculation is incorrect, the program may output incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When calculating factorials, it is easy to make off-by-one errors. For example, the factorial of 5 is 120, but if you accidentally calculate 121, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Recursion errors**. If the factorial function is implemented using recursion, it is easy to make stack overflow errors.
5. **Memory errors**. If the factorial function is implemented using an iterative approach, it is easy to run out of memory if the input number is large.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input format. It is also important to carefully verify the correctness of your calculations. Finally, it is important to use appropriate data structures and algorithms to avoid memory errors.

CODEFORCES 673_A. Bear and Game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain one integer n, and the second line should contain n integers t1, t2, ..., tn. However, a developer might accidentally read the input incorrectly, and read n as a string instead of an integer, or read the second line as a single integer instead of a list of integers. This would result in a incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of boring minutes.** The problem states that Limak will turn off the TV if there are 15 consecutive boring minutes. However, a developer might accidentally count the number of boring minutes incorrectly, or they might not account for the fact that the last minute of the game might be boring. This would result in an incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of minutes Limak will watch the game.** The problem states that Limak will watch the game for as many minutes as there are interesting minutes, minus the number of boring minutes. However, a developer might accidentally subtract the number of boring minutes from the number of interesting minutes before adding 1, or they might not account for the fact that the last minute of the game might be interesting. This would result in an incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The problem states that the output should be a single integer, representing the number of minutes Limak will watch the game. However, a developer might accidentally output a string instead of an integer, or they might output multiple integers. This would result in an incorrect output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 698_B. Fix a Tree

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrectly counting the number of changes needed to make the sequence valid.** This is a common mistake that can be made when first learning about trees. It is important to remember that each change to the sequence must result in a valid tree, and that not all changes will result in a valid tree.
* **Using a brute force approach to find the minimum number of changes needed.** This can be very time-consuming, especially for large trees. There are more efficient algorithms that can be used to find the minimum number of changes.
* **Not handling all possible cases.** The problem statement specifies that the tree must be rooted in a vertex 1 through n. It is important to make sure that the algorithm handles all possible cases, including trees that are not rooted in a vertex 1 through n.
* **Using incorrect data types.** The problem statement specifies that the input will be a sequence of integers. It is important to make sure that the algorithm is using the correct data types to store and process the input data.
* **Making a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can be made when implementing any algorithm. It is important to carefully review the algorithm and make sure that it is implemented correctly.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly counting the number of changes needed to make the sequence valid.** For example, a developer might incorrectly count the number of changes needed to make the sequence `1 2 3 4` valid. They might think that the sequence is already valid, because it contains no cycles. However, the sequence is not valid, because it does not have a single root vertex.
* **Using a brute force approach to find the minimum number of changes needed.** For example, a developer might try to find the minimum number of changes needed to make the sequence `1 2 3 4` valid by trying every possible combination of changes. This would be very time-consuming, especially for large trees.
* **Not handling all possible cases.** For example, a developer might not handle the case where the tree is not rooted in a vertex 1 through n. This could result in the algorithm returning an incorrect answer.
* **Using incorrect data types.** For example, a developer might use a `string` to store the input data. This would be incorrect, because the input data is a sequence of integers.
* **Making a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm.** For example, a developer might incorrectly implement the algorithm to find the minimum number of changes needed. This could result in the algorithm returning an incorrect answer.

   5 10  6
 **1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very strict. It is possible to enter the number of vertices in the first line, and then the edges in the next n-1 lines. However, it is also possible to enter the edges in the first line, and then the number of vertices in the next line. This will cause the program to crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer, which is the index of the vertex in which Timofey should stand. However, it is possible to output a string, a list of integers, or even a function. This will cause the program to crash.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the number of non-isomorphic subtrees**

The number of non-isomorphic subtrees is calculated by counting the number of ways to arrange the children of a vertex in a tree. However, it is possible to count the number of ways to arrange the children of a vertex in a graph, which will give the wrong answer.

**4. Incorrect identification of the most beautiful rooted tree**

The most beautiful rooted tree is the tree with the most non-isomorphic subtrees. However, it is possible to identify a tree with fewer non-isomorphic subtrees as the most beautiful tree. This will cause the program to output the wrong answer.

**5. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The algorithm for finding the most beautiful rooted tree is not very difficult to implement. However, it is possible to make mistakes in the implementation, which will cause the program to output the wrong answer.

CODEFORCES 787_A. The Monster

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect calculation of the time when Rick and Morty will scream at the same time.** This is the most common mistake, and it can be caused by a number of factors, including:
    * Using the wrong formula to calculate the time.
    * Making a mistake in the arithmetic.
    * Using the wrong values for the variables.
2. **Using the wrong data type for the variables.** This can cause problems when calculating the time when Rick and Morty will scream at the same time, because the values of the variables may be too large for the data type that you are using.
3. **Not handling the case where Rick and Morty will never scream at the same time.** This is a relatively rare case, but it is important to handle it correctly, so that your program does not crash.
4. **Using a brute-force approach to solve the problem.** This is often not the most efficient way to solve the problem, and it can lead to a slow-running program.
5. **Not using the appropriate data structures to solve the problem.** This can also lead to a slow-running program.
6. **Not using the appropriate algorithms to solve the problem.** This can also lead to a slow-running program.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the constraints. You should also carefully plan your solution and make sure that you are using the correct data types and algorithms. It is also helpful to test your solution on a variety of test cases, to make sure that it is correct.

CODEFORCES 808_E. Selling Souvenirs

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correct. For example, the input may contain two integers instead of three, or the integers may not be in the correct range.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correct. For example, the output may contain a string instead of an integer, or the integer may not be in the correct range.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm may not be correct. For example, the algorithm may not find the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. The implementation of the algorithm may be incorrect. For example, the implementation may contain errors in the logic or the code may not be efficient.
5. **Incorrect testing**. The testing of the algorithm may be incorrect. For example, the tests may not test all possible cases or the tests may not be comprehensive.
6. **Incorrect debugging**. The debugging of the algorithm may be incorrect. For example, the debugger may not be used correctly or the debugger may not be able to find the bug.
7. **Incorrect documentation**. The documentation of the algorithm may be incorrect. For example, the documentation may not be complete or the documentation may not be accurate.

CODEFORCES 833_A. The Meaningless Game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when reading the input data. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the results**. The game rules are not very complicated, but it is still possible to make a mistake when calculating the results. For example, if you forget to multiply the winner's score by k2, the program will give the wrong answer.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when writing the output data. For example, if you forget to capitalize the first letter of the output string, the program will not be accepted.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program may allocate memory that it does not need, which can lead to a memory leak. This can eventually cause the program to crash.
5. **Race conditions**. The program may access shared data from multiple threads without synchronization, which can lead to incorrect results.
6. **Deadlocks**. The program may enter a deadlock state, where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, which can prevent the program from making any progress.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may contain security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or SQL injection, which can allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design the program and to test it thoroughly before deploying it to production.

Title:
CODEFORCES 853_D. Michael and Charging Stations

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable types**. The problem statement specifies that the number of days is an integer, but the code below incorrectly defines it as a float. This will cause the program to crash when it tries to iterate over the days.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. The code below incorrectly calculates the number of days in the input, resulting in one fewer day being processed than intended. This will cause the program to output an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code below incorrectly calculates the minimum amount of money Michael needs to spend. It does not take into account the fact that he can use his bonus burles to cover some of the cost, and it also does not account for the fact that he gets a 10% bonus on each purchase. This will cause the program to output an incorrect answer.
4. **Uninitialized variables**. The code below does not initialize the `bonus` variable, which means that it will contain a random value when the program starts. This could cause the program to behave incorrectly.
5. **Use of global variables**. The code below uses the `bonus` variable as a global variable, which means that it can be accessed from any function in the program. This can make it difficult to track the value of the variable and can lead to errors.
6. **Inefficient code**. The code below uses a nested loop to iterate over the days, which is inefficient. A more efficient approach would be to use a single loop.
7. **Incorrect error handling**. The code below does not handle errors gracefully. If an error occurs, the program will simply crash. A more robust approach would be to catch the error and print a message to the user.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* **Use the correct variable types**. Make sure that all variables are declared with the correct data type. This will help to prevent errors and make your code more efficient.
* **Check for off-by-one errors**. When iterating over a collection of items, make sure to check for off-by-one errors. This can be done by using the `len()` function to get the number of items in the collection.
* **Use correct logic**. Make sure that your code is logically correct. This means that it does what you expect it to do and that it doesn't have any unexpected side effects.
* **Initialize variables**. Always initialize variables before using them. This will help to prevent errors and make your code more readable.
* **Use local variables**. Use local variables whenever possible. This will help to prevent errors and make your code more modular.
* **Write efficient code**. Use efficient algorithms and data structures to make your code run faster.
* **Handle errors gracefully**. Catch errors and print a message to the user so that they know what happened.

Title:
CODEFORCES 924_A. Mystical Mosaic

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**

The input format of the problem is `n m` followed by `n` lines of `m` characters. However, a developer may accidentally input `n m` followed by `n` lines of `m` numbers. This will cause the program to crash.

**2. The developer does not handle the corner cases**

The problem states that `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50`. However, a developer may accidentally hard-code the values of `n` and `m` to be larger than 50. This will cause the program to crash.

**3. The developer does not check for invalid input**

The problem states that each cell in the grid must be either `.` or `#`. However, a developer may accidentally input a cell that is not `.` or `#`. This will cause the program to crash.

**4. The developer does not check for duplicate rows or columns**

The problem states that a row or a column can only be chosen at most once. However, a developer may accidentally choose the same row or column twice. This will cause the program to output the wrong answer.

**5. The developer does not check for conflicts between rows and columns**

The problem states that no pair of (i, j) (i < j) exists such that `Ri ∩ Ci ≠ ∅` or `Rj ∩ Ci ≠ ∅`. However, a developer may accidentally choose two rows or columns that intersect. This will cause the program to output the wrong answer.

**6. The developer does not use the correct data structures**

The problem requires the developer to keep track of the rows and columns that have been chosen. A developer may accidentally use the wrong data structures to store this information, which will cause the program to run slowly or crash.

**7. The developer does not use the correct algorithms**

The problem requires the developer to find a valid sequence of operations that produces the given grid. A developer may accidentally use the wrong algorithms, which will cause the program to run slowly or output the wrong answer.

**8. The developer does not test the program thoroughly**

The developer should test the program thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly. This includes testing for all of the possible input formats, corner cases, invalid input, duplicate rows and columns, conflicts between rows and columns, and incorrect data structures and algorithms.

CODEFORCES 999_F. Cards and Joy

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to include a space between two numbers, the input will be interpreted incorrectly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output for this problem should be a single integer. If you accidentally print multiple integers, or if you print a non-integer value, your submission will be incorrect.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. This problem involves a lot of counting, and it is easy to make a mistake and count one number too many or too few. For example, if you forget to add one to the number of cards that a player has, their joy level will be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The logic for this problem is relatively straightforward, but it is easy to make a mistake. For example, if you forget to consider the case where a player has no cards with their favorite number, their joy level will be incorrect.
5. **Memory leaks**. This problem does not require a lot of memory, but it is still possible to create a memory leak if you are not careful. For example, if you allocate a large array and then forget to free it, your program will eventually run out of memory.
6. **Timeouts**. This problem does not have a strict time limit, but it is still possible to run out of time if your solution is too inefficient. For example, if your solution takes too long to sort the cards, it will not be able to finish in time.

HACKEREARTH compiler-version-2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly matching delimiters.** The delimiters for comments (`//`) can be easily missed, especially if they are not properly aligned. This can lead to incorrect replacement of `->` with `.` inside comments.
2. **Not handling nested comments correctly.** Comments can be nested, meaning that a comment can be inside another comment. This can be tricky to handle correctly, as it is possible for the inner comment to end before the outer comment does. This can lead to incorrect replacement of `->` with `.` inside comments.
3. **Not handling comments that span multiple lines correctly.** Comments can span multiple lines, which can be even more difficult to handle correctly than nested comments. This is because it is possible for the end of the comment to be on a different line than the start of the comment. This can lead to incorrect replacement of `->` with `.` inside comments.
4. **Not handling comments that contain special characters correctly.** Comments can contain special characters, such as `*`, `&`, `#`, etc. These characters can be interpreted incorrectly by the compiler, which can lead to incorrect replacement of `->` with `.` inside comments.
5. **Not handling comments that are incorrectly formatted correctly.** Comments can be incorrectly formatted, such as having missing or extra spaces. This can lead to incorrect replacement of `->` with `.` inside comments.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the input code and make sure that all of the comments are correctly handled. This can be a time-consuming process, but it is important to do it correctly in order to avoid any errors in the output code.

Title:
HACKEREARTH fight-for-chocolate

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of valid ways to divide the chocolate bar.** This is a common mistake that can be made when solving this problem. The key to getting the correct answer is to first identify all of the valid ways to divide the chocolate bar, and then count the number of ways that satisfy the constraints.
2. **Not considering all of the possible ways to divide the chocolate bar.** Another common mistake is to only consider a subset of the possible ways to divide the chocolate bar. For example, you might only consider ways to divide the chocolate bar into two equal pieces, or you might only consider ways to divide the chocolate bar into pieces that are all rectangular. In order to get the correct answer, you need to consider all of the possible ways to divide the chocolate bar.
3. **Making a mistake in your implementation.** This is another common mistake that can be made when solving this problem. It is important to carefully check your implementation for errors, such as off-by-one errors or incorrect boundary conditions.
4. **Not understanding the problem statement.** This is the most fundamental mistake that can be made when solving this problem. It is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement before you begin to work on a solution.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly counting the number of valid ways to divide the chocolate bar.** For example, you might incorrectly count the number of ways to divide the chocolate bar into two equal pieces, or you might only consider ways to divide the chocolate bar into pieces that are all rectangular.
* **Not considering all of the possible ways to divide the chocolate bar.** For example, you might only consider ways to divide the chocolate bar into two pieces, or you might only consider ways to divide the chocolate bar into pieces that are all rectangular.
* **Making a mistake in your implementation.** For example, you might make an off-by-one error when counting the number of valid ways to divide the chocolate bar, or you might incorrectly check for the validity of a particular way to divide the chocolate bar.
* **Not understanding the problem statement.** For example, you might not realize that the absolute difference between the number of chocolates in pieces should be at most K, or you might not realize that in any piece, there should not be 4 adjacent chocolates that form a square.

HACKEREARTH ikshu-and-his-class-1

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data is about the number of students and the number of connections between students. The number of students can be up to 100,000, and the number of connections can be up to 100,000. So we need to use a data type that can store large numbers. We can use `int` for the number of students and `long` for the number of connections.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The problem is about the number of distinct exchanges possible. We can use a recursive algorithm to solve this problem. The base case is when there is only one student. In this case, the number of distinct exchanges is 1. The recursive case is when there are two or more students. In this case, we can divide the students into two groups and calculate the number of distinct exchanges in each group. Then we can multiply the two numbers to get the total number of distinct exchanges.

**3. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

We need to make sure that we handle the boundary conditions correctly. For example, if there is only one student, the number of distinct exchanges is 1. If there are no connections between students, the number of distinct exchanges is also 1.

**4. Using incorrect modular arithmetic**

The output of the program should be a number modulo (10^9 + 7). We can use the `%` operator to perform modular arithmetic.

**5. Using incorrect variable names**

The variable names should be descriptive and easy to understand. For example, we can use `n` for the number of students, `k` for the number of connections, and `i` for the index of a student.

**6. Using incorrect indentation**

The code should be well-indented to make it easy to read.

**7. Using incorrect comments**

The comments should be informative and explain what the code is doing.

**8. Using incorrect syntax**

The code should be syntactically correct.

**9. Using incorrect capitalization**

The code should be written in lowercase except for the names of classes, variables, and functions.

**10. Using incorrect spacing**

The code should be well-spaced to make it easy to read.

Title:
HACKEREARTH mark-the-answer-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The problem states that the number of questions is `N` and the maximum difficulty level is `X`. However, the code uses `n` and `x` as the variable names for these values. This could lead to errors if the values are not of the correct type.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator.** The problem states that Monk can only solve problems with a difficulty level less than `X`. However, the code uses the `>` operator to compare the difficulty level to `X`. This could lead to Monk solving problems that he is not allowed to.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The problem states that Monk is allowed to skip one question. However, the code does not check if Monk has already skipped a question before skipping another one. This could lead to Monk skipping more than one question, which is not allowed.
4. **Incorrect output.** The problem states that the output should be the maximum number of questions that Monk can solve without skipping a question. However, the code outputs the number of questions that Monk has solved, including the questions that he has skipped. This is incorrect.

To avoid these problems, the following steps should be taken:

1. Use the correct variable type for the number of questions and the maximum difficulty level.
2. Use the correct comparison operator to compare the difficulty level to `X`.
3. Check if Monk has already skipped a question before skipping another one.
4. Output the maximum number of questions that Monk can solve without skipping a question.

2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values must be correct in order for the program to work properly. For example, if the input values are strings instead of integers, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are common in programming, and they can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program is supposed to find all the numbers from 1 to 100 that are not in a list, but the program only checks the numbers from 1 to 99, it will miss the number 100.
4. **Boundary conditions**. Boundary conditions are special cases that must be handled correctly in order for the program to work properly. For example, if the program is supposed to find all the numbers from 1 to 100 that are not in a list, but the list is empty, the program must handle this case correctly.
5. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be correct in order for the program to work properly. For example, if the program is supposed to find all the numbers from 1 to 100 that are not in a list, but the program does not check all the numbers in the list, it will miss some of the numbers.
6. **Uncaught exceptions**. Uncaught exceptions can cause the program to crash. For example, if the program tries to divide by zero, it will throw an exception that will not be caught by the program. This can cause the program to crash.
7. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks can cause the program to run out of memory and crash. For example, if the program allocates memory for a variable but does not free it when it is no longer needed, the memory will be leaked. This can eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can allow attackers to gain access to the program and its data. For example, if the program does not properly validate user input, an attacker could inject malicious code into the program. This could allow the attacker to take control of the program or access its data.
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect input format**

```
n = int(input())
l1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
m = int(input())
l2 = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(1, 101):
    if i not in l1 and i in l2:
        print(i)
```

This program will crash if the input is not in the correct format. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program will crash.

2. **Incorrect data type**

```
n = int(input())
l1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
m = int(input())
l2 = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(1, 101):
    if i not in l1 and i in l2:
        print(str(i))
```

This program will crash if the input values are not integers. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program will crash.

3. **Off-by-one errors**

```
n = int(input())
l1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
m = int(input())
l2 = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(1, 101):
    if i not in l1 and i in l2:
        print(i)
```

This program will miss the number 100 because it only checks the numbers from 1 to 99.

4. **Boundary conditions**

```
n = int(input())
l1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
m = int(input())
l2 = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(1, 101):
    if i not in l1 and i in l2:
        print(i)
```

This program will crash if the list l1 is empty.

5. **Incorrect logic**

```
n = int(input())
l1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
m = int(input())
l2 = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(1, 101):
    if i not in l1 and i in l2:
        print(i)
```

This program will print the number 100 twice because it does not check if the number has already been printed.

6. **Uncaught exceptions**

```
n = int(input())
l1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
m = int(input())
l2 = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(1, 101):
    if i not in l1 and i in l2:
        print(i)
```

This program will crash if the number 100 is not in the list l2.

7. **Memory leaks**

```
n = int(input())
l1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
m = int(input())
l2 = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(1, 101):
    if i not in l1 and i in l2:
        print(i)
```

This program will leak memory because it does not free the memory allocated for the list l1.

8. **Security vulnerabilities**

```
n = int(input())
l1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
m = int(input())
l2 = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(1, 101):
    if i not in l1 and i in l2:
        print(i)
```

This program is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack because it does not check the size of the input before printing it.

HACKEREARTH racers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain three integers, N, M, and K, separated by a single space. However, the sample input contains only two integers, N and M. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input format specifies that the co-ordinates of the bikers and bikes should be integers. However, the sample input contains some co-ordinates that are not integers. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The program should calculate the square of the required time to start the race as soon as possible. However, the sample output is not the square of the required time. This could be caused by a mistake in the calculation or by a bug in the program.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the output should be a single line containing the square of the required time. However, the sample output contains multiple lines of text. This could be caused by a mistake in the output formatting or by a bug in the program.
5. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other possible bugs that could occur when solving this problem. These include:
    * Memory leaks
    * Race conditions
    * Incorrect locking
    * Incorrect exception handling
    * Incorrect error handling
    * Incorrect unit testing
    * Incorrect documentation

Title:
HACKEREARTH shil-and-survival-game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement states that "the king randomly chooses any two persons standing next to each other in line and kills the one having lower strength". This means that the person with the highest strength will always survive. However, some developers may mistakenly assume that the person with the lowest strength will always survive. This will result in an incorrect solution.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for solving this problem is relatively simple. However, some developers may make mistakes in implementing the algorithm. For example, they may forget to check for edge cases or they may make a mistake in the logic of the algorithm. This will result in an incorrect solution.
3. **Incorrect testing.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly before submitting it. This will help you to catch any errors in your code. Some developers may not test their solution thoroughly enough, which can lead to errors being missed. This will result in an incorrect solution.
4. **Incorrect submission.** Once you have verified that your solution is correct, you need to submit it correctly. Some developers may make mistakes in the submission process, such as forgetting to include the correct file or submitting the wrong file. This will result in your solution not being evaluated.
5. **Incorrect understanding of the time complexity.** The time complexity of the algorithm for solving this problem is O(N). However, some developers may incorrectly assume that the time complexity is O(N^2). This will result in an incorrect solution.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement, carefully implement the algorithm, thoroughly test your solution, and correctly submit your solution.

ATCODER p02537 ACL Beginner Contest - Flat Subsequence

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the sliding window algorithm.** The sliding window algorithm is a common technique for finding subsequences in a given sequence. However, it is important to implement the algorithm correctly, or you may get incorrect results. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
def find_subsequence(A, K):
  """Finds the longest subsequence in A with a maximum absolute difference of K.

  Args:
    A: The input sequence.
    K: The maximum absolute difference.

  Returns:
    The length of the longest subsequence.
  """
  # Initialize the sliding window.
  window = [A[0]]
  max_length = 1

  # Iterate over the remaining elements in A.
  for i in range(1, len(A)):
    # Check if the new element can be added to the sliding window.
    if abs(A[i] - window[-1]) <= K:
      window.append(A[i])
      max_length = max(max_length, len(window))
    # Otherwise, remove the first element from the sliding window.
    else:
      window.pop(0)

  return max_length

```

This code would not work correctly because it does not handle the case where the first element in A is greater than K away from the second element. In this case, the sliding window would be empty, and the function would return a length of 0.

To fix this, we need to add a check to make sure that the first element in the sliding window is within K units of the second element. We can do this by adding the following line to the code:

```
if abs(A[0] - A[1]) > K:
  return 0
```

With this change, the code will now correctly find the longest subsequence in A with a maximum absolute difference of K.

2. **Using an incorrect data structure.** The data structure that you use to store the subsequences can have a significant impact on the performance of your algorithm. For example, using a list to store the subsequences would be much slower than using a set. This is because a list has to be traversed in order to find a particular element, while a set can be searched in constant time.

To avoid this problem, you should use a data structure that allows you to quickly search for elements. A set is a good option for this, as it can be searched in constant time.

3. **Not handling edge cases correctly.** It is important to handle edge cases correctly when writing code, as they can cause your program to crash or produce incorrect results. For example, the following code would not work correctly if the input sequence is empty:

```
def find_subsequence(A, K):
  """Finds the longest subsequence in A with a maximum absolute difference of K.

  Args:
    A: The input sequence.
    K: The maximum absolute difference.

  Returns:
    The length of the longest subsequence.
  """
  if len(A) == 0:
    return 0
  else:
    return 1
```

To fix this, we need to add a check to make sure that the input sequence is not empty. We can do this by adding the following line to the code:

```
if len(A) == 0:
  return 0
```

With this change, the code will now correctly handle the case where the input sequence is empty.

4. **Using inefficient algorithms.** The algorithm that you use to solve the problem can have a significant impact on the performance of your program. For example, using a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem would be much slower than using a more efficient algorithm.

To avoid this problem, you should use an efficient algorithm to solve the problem. A good option for this problem would be the sliding window algorithm.

5. **Not using the right data types.** The data types that you use can have a significant impact on the performance of your program. For example, using integers to store floating-point numbers would be much slower than using floating-point numbers.

To avoid this problem, you should use the right data types for the problem that you are solving. For this problem, you should use integers to store the elements in the input sequence and floating-point numbers to store the maximum absolute difference.

Title:
ATCODER p02668 NOMURA Programming Competition 2020 - Sorting Game

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect modular arithmetic.**

When doing modular arithmetic, it is important to be aware of the modulus and to make sure that all calculations are done modulo the modulus. For example, if you are working modulo 10, then 11 + 12 is not equal to 23, because 11 + 12 = 23 mod 10. Instead, 11 + 12 is equal to 3 mod 10.

**2. Off-by-one errors.**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a developer forgets to add or subtract one when performing an arithmetic operation. For example, if you are trying to find the sum of the first 100 numbers, you might accidentally write `sum = sum + 100` instead of `sum = sum + 99`. This would result in an incorrect answer of 101 instead of 5050.

**3. Undefined behavior.**

Undefined behavior occurs when a program does something that is not specified in the language's specification. For example, in C++, it is undefined behavior to divide by zero. This means that the compiler is free to do whatever it wants when it encounters a division by zero, and the results are not guaranteed to be correct.

**4. Memory leaks.**

A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

**5. Race conditions.**

A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same shared data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even a program crash.

**6. Deadlocks.**

A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, and neither thread can progress. This can also lead to a program crash.

**7. Security vulnerabilities.**

Security vulnerabilities can occur when a program does not properly protect its data from unauthorized access. This can allow attackers to steal data, modify data, or even take control of the program.

**8. Unintended consequences.**

When making changes to a program, it is important to be aware of the potential unintended consequences. For example, changing one line of code could cause a different part of the program to stop working. It is important to test your changes thoroughly to make sure that they do not have any unintended consequences.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specified in the problem statement is `a
s`. If the input format is incorrect, the program may not work as expected. For example, if the input format is `a s`, the program may not be able to correctly parse the input and may output incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect variable type**. The variable `a` should be of type `int`, but if it is declared as a different type, the program may not work as expected. For example, if `a` is declared as a type `float`, the program may not be able to correctly compare `a` to 3200 and may output incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect string comparison**. The program should compare `a` to 3200 using the `>` operator. If the comparison is done incorrectly, the program may not output the correct result. For example, if the comparison is done using the `>=` operator, the program may output `red` for inputs that are greater than or equal to 3200, even if they are not less than 3200.
4. **Incorrect string output**. The program should output the string `s` if `a` is not less than 3200 and the string `red` if `a` is less than 3200. If the output is incorrect, the program may not produce the expected results. For example, if the program outputs `red` for inputs that are not less than 3200, the output will be incorrect.

ATCODER p03069 Tenka1 Programmer Beginner Contest 2019 - Stones

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect variable type

The problem states that "N represents the number of stones", but the code below uses `n` to represent the number of stones. This will cause the code to fail because `n` is not a valid variable type.

```
n = int(input())
S = input()
```

The correct code should be:

```
N = int(input())
S = input()
```

### 2. Incorrect variable name

The problem states that "S represents the color of the stones", but the code below uses `s` to represent the color of the stones. This will cause the code to fail because `s` is not a valid variable name.

```
n = int(input())
S = input()
```

The correct code should be:

```
N = int(input())
s = input()
```

### 3. Incorrect logic

The problem states that "Takahashi wants to change the colors of some stones to black or white so that there will be no white stone immediately to the right of a black stone", but the code below does not check for this condition. This will cause the code to output the wrong answer.

```
n = int(input())
S = input()

count = 0
for i in range(n):
    if S[i] == ".":
        count += 1
print(count)
```

The correct code should check for the condition that there is no white stone immediately to the right of a black stone. This can be done by using the following logic:

```
n = int(input())
S = input()

count = 0
for i in range(n):
    if S[i] == ".":
        count += 1
    else:

1. **Incorrect use of data types**. The input `N` is an integer, but the developer may accidentally use a floating-point type to store it. This could lead to incorrect results.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer may accidentally count one or more numbers twice. This could lead to an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may incorrectly implement the algorithm for finding the number of Shichi-Go-San numbers. This could lead to an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect bounds checking**. The developer may not check that `N` is within the valid range. This could lead to a runtime error.
5. **Incorrect error handling**. The developer may not handle errors that occur during the execution of the program. This could lead to a program crash.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully review their code and test it thoroughly. They should also use a debugger to help identify any errors that may be present.

ATCODER p03519 CODE FESTIVAL 2017 Elimination Tournament Round 1 (Parallel) - Paired Parentheses

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem is about finding the maximum possible beauty of a pair of balanced sequences of parentheses. A balanced sequence of parentheses is a string that can be formed by concatenating `(`, s, `)`, where s is a balanced sequence of parentheses, or by concatenating s, t, where s and t are balanced sequences of parentheses. The beauty of a pair of balanced sequences of parentheses is calculated as follows:

```
Let X=0.
For each i between 1 and 2N (inclusive), increment X by a_i if s_i = t_i, and increment X by b_i otherwise.
The beauty of (s,t) is the final value of X.
```

2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution to this problem is not trivial. A naive implementation would take O(N^2) time, which is too slow. A more efficient solution can be found in the following [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-beauty-of-a-pair-of-parenthesis-strings/solution/).

3. **Incorrect testing of the solution.** It is important to test the solution thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. This can be done by generating a variety of test cases and checking that the solution returns the correct answer for each case.

4. **Failure to handle edge cases.** The problem statement does not explicitly mention any edge cases, but it is important to be aware of them and handle them correctly. For example, the input could contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or strings that are not balanced sequences of parentheses. The solution must be able to handle these cases gracefully.

ATCODER p03684 AtCoder Regular Contest 076 - Built?

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is given as integers, but the problem asks for the minimum necessary amount of money. This could be interpreted as a floating-point number, which would lead to incorrect results. To avoid this, the data should be converted to integers before being used in calculations.

**2. Not considering all possible cases**

The problem states that there may be more than one town at the same coordinates. This means that it is possible for two towns to be connected by multiple roads. When calculating the minimum necessary amount of money, it is important to consider all possible ways of connecting the towns.

**3. Making a mistake in the calculation**

The calculation of the minimum necessary amount of money can be quite complex. It is important to be careful to avoid making mistakes, such as adding or subtracting the wrong values.

**4. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a brute-force algorithm, but this would be very inefficient. A more efficient algorithm can be used to find the minimum necessary amount of money in O(N log N) time.

Title:
ATCODER p03837 AtCoder Beginner Contest 051 - Candidates of No Shortest Paths

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not well-defined.** The input format does not specify the order of the edges. This could lead to a bug where the edges are not processed in the correct order.
2. **The input data may not be valid.** The input data may contain invalid values, such as negative edges or self-loops. This could lead to a bug where the program crashes or produces incorrect results.
3. **The algorithm may not be correct.** The algorithm used to find the shortest paths may not be correct. This could lead to a bug where the program produces incorrect results.
4. **The output format is not well-defined.** The output format does not specify the number of decimal places to use. This could lead to a bug where the output is not formatted correctly.
5. **The program may not be efficient.** The program may take a long time to run, especially for large graphs. This could lead to a bug where the program times out or crashes.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully review the input format, the input data, the algorithm, the output format, and the efficiency of the program.

Title:
ATCODER p04004 AtCoder Regular Contest 061 - Card Game for Three

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect modular arithmetic**

When performing modular arithmetic, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct modulus. In this problem, the modulus is 10^9+7. This means that when you perform an arithmetic operation, you need to make sure that the result is less than or equal to 10^9+7.

For example, if you are adding two numbers, you need to make sure that the sum is less than or equal to 10^9+7. You can do this by first performing the addition, and then taking the remainder when you divide the result by 10^9+7.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that can occur when you are counting or iterating over a set of items. In this problem, you need to be careful not to count the empty deck as a possible winning state for Alice.

**3. Incorrect use of bitwise operations**

Bitwise operations can be a powerful tool, but they can also be a source of errors. In this problem, you need to be careful not to use bitwise operations in a way that will produce incorrect results.

For example, if you are trying to count the number of bits that are set in a number, you should use the `count()` function instead of performing a bitwise operation.

**4. Using the wrong data type**

When solving a problem, it is important to use the correct data type for the values that you are working with. In this problem, you need to use the `int` data type for all of the numbers.

Using the wrong data type can lead to errors, such as overflows or underflows.

**5. Not using enough precision**

When performing calculations, it is important to use enough precision to avoid rounding errors. In this problem, you need to use at least 64 bits of precision.

Using too little precision can lead to errors, such as incorrect results or incorrect rounding.

**6. Not handling special cases**

It is important to handle special cases in your code. In this problem, you need to handle the case where one of the players has no cards.

Not handling special cases can lead to errors, such as incorrect results or crashes.

Title:
AIZU p01448 A Way to Invite Friends

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data contains integers, so we should use the `int` data type to store them. However, if we accidentally use the `str` data type, we will get a `ValueError` exception.

```python
n = int(input())
a1, b1 = map(int, input().split())
a2, b2 = map(int, input().split())
```

**2. Using the wrong index**

The input data is a list of lists, and each inner list contains two integers. So we should use the `[0]` index to access the first integer and the `[1]` index to access the second integer. However, if we accidentally use the wrong index, we will get a `IndexError` exception.

```python
n = int(input())
a1, b1 = map(int, input().split())
a2, b2 = map(int, input().split())

# This will raise an IndexError exception
a3 = a1[2]
```

**3. Not handling the corner cases**

The input data may contain some corner cases, such as a friend who wants to go to the sea with no one else, or a friend who wants to go to the sea with everyone else. We need to handle these corner cases correctly, or our program will not work correctly.

```python
n = int(input())
a1, b1 = map(int, input().split())
a2, b2 = map(int, input().split())

# This will not work if n == 0
if n == 0:
    print(0)

# This will not work if a1 == 1 and b1 == n
if a1 == 1 and b1 == n:
    print(1)
```

**4. Not using the right algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. We start by inviting the friend with the smallest `ai` value. Then, we iterate over the remaining friends and invite the friend with the smallest `bi` value that is greater than or equal to the current number of friends. We continue this process until we have invited all of the friends or until we reach a friend whose `bi` value is greater than the current number of friends.

```python
def invite_friends(a, b):
    n = len(a)
    count = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n and count < n:
        if a[i] <= count and count <= b[i]:
            count += 1
        i += 1
    return count


n = int(input())
a = []
b = []
for _ in range(n):
    a1, b1 = map(int, input().split())
    a.append(a1)
    b.append(b1)

print(invite_friends(a, b))
```
Test inputs:
**1. Invalid data type**

```
n = str(input())

**2. Wrong index**

```
n = int(input())
a1, b1 = map(int, input().split())
a2, b2 = map(int, input().split())

a3 = a1[2]
```

**3. Not handling the corner cases**

```
n = int(input())
a1, b1 = map(int, input().split())
a2, b2 = map(int, input().split())

if n == 0:
    print(0)

if a1 == 1 and b1 == n:
    print(1)
```

**4. Not using the right algorithm**

```
n = int(input())
a = []
b = []
for _ in range(n):
    a1, b1 = map(int, input().split())
    a.append(a1)
    b.append(b1)

print(invite_friends(a, b))

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain a number that is too large, or it may not contain the correct number of lines. The developer should check the input format carefully and handle any errors appropriately.
2. **Incorrect calculation of happiness**. The developer should be careful when calculating the happiness. For example, the happiness may be negative, or it may overflow. The developer should handle these cases correctly.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correct. For example, the output may contain a number that is too large, or it may not contain the correct number of digits. The developer should check the output format carefully and make sure that it is correct.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer should be careful not to create any memory leaks. This can be done by using the `delete` keyword to delete objects that are no longer needed.
5. **Synchronization issues**. The developer should be careful not to create any synchronization issues. This can be done by using the `mutex` keyword to protect shared data.
6. **Race conditions**. The developer should be careful not to create any race conditions. This can be done by using the `atomic` keyword to access shared data.
7. **Deadlocks**. The developer should be careful not to create any deadlocks. This can be done by using the `lock` keyword to acquire locks in the correct order.
8. **Unhandled exceptions**. The developer should be careful to handle any exceptions that are thrown. This can be done by using the `try`-`catch` statement.
9. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer should be careful not to create any security vulnerabilities. This can be done by using the `const` keyword to declare constants, and by using the `sanitize_string()` function to sanitize user input.
10. **Performance issues**. The developer should be careful not to create any performance issues. This can be done by using the `vector` data structure instead of the `array` data structure, and by using the `std::sort()` function to sort data.

**1. Not handling the edge case of an empty input list correctly.** The problem statement specifies that the input list should have a length of at least 1, but some solutions may not check for this and will throw an error if the input list is empty.
2. **Not handling duplicate elements in the input list correctly.** The problem statement specifies that the subsequences should be renumbered starting from 1, even if they contain duplicate elements. Some solutions may not handle this correctly and will output incorrect results if the input list contains duplicate elements.
3. **Not using the modulus operator correctly.** The problem statement specifies that the output should be the remainder of the sum of the subsequence powers divided by 998244353. Some solutions may not use the modulus operator correctly and will output incorrect results.
4. **Not using the correct data types.** The problem statement specifies that the input and output should be integers. Some solutions may use the wrong data types, such as floats or strings, and will output incorrect results.
5. **Not using efficient algorithms.** The problem can be solved in O(N^2) time using a dynamic programming approach. Some solutions may use inefficient algorithms, such as a brute-force approach, and will run slowly.
Test inputs:
```
# 1. Not handling the edge case of an empty input list correctly.

N = 0
A = []
print(0)

# 2. Not handling duplicate elements in the input list correctly.

N = 3
A = [1, 1, 1]
print(12)

# 3. Not using the modulus operator correctly.

N = 3
A = [1, 2, 3]
print(64 % 998244353)

# 4. Not using the correct data types.

N = 3
A = [1, 2, 3]
print(int(64 % 998244353))

# 5. Not using efficient algorithms.

N = 5
A = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]

dp = [[0 for _ in range(N + 1)] for _ in range(N + 1)]
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    dp[i][0] = 1
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    for j in range(1, i + 1):
        dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j - 1] * A[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][j]) % 998244353

print(sum(dp[N][1:]))
```

AIZU p02317 Longest Increasing Subsequence

Pain points:
**1. Off-by-one errors**

When finding the longest increasing subsequence, it is easy to make off-by-one errors. For example, you might accidentally compare the current element to the element at index `i - 1` instead of `i - 2`. This can lead to incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect base cases**

The base cases for the longest increasing subsequence problem are often overlooked. For example, you might assume that the longest increasing subsequence in an empty array is 0, when it is actually 1. This can lead to incorrect results.

**3. Using the wrong data structure**

The longest increasing subsequence problem can be solved using a variety of data structures. However, not all data structures are created equal. For example, using a linked list to solve the problem is much slower than using a binary search tree.

**4. Optimizing for the wrong metrics**

When solving the longest increasing subsequence problem, it is important to focus on optimizing for the correct metrics. For example, you might try to optimize for the time complexity of your algorithm, when in reality the space complexity is more important. This can lead to incorrect results.

**5. Not using existing libraries**

There are a number of existing libraries that can be used to solve the longest increasing subsequence problem. Using these libraries can save you a lot of time and effort.

**6. Incorrect test cases**

When testing your solution to the longest increasing subsequence problem, it is important to use a variety of test cases. This will help you to identify and fix any bugs in your code.
