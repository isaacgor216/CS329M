Title:
CODECHEF chapd

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input and output constraints are quite large, so it is important to use the correct data type to store the numbers. For example, if you use `int` to store `A` and `B`, you may get an overflow error when `A` or `B` is very large.

**2. Not considering all the prime divisors of `B`**

The problem statement says that you need to check whether `A` is divisible by all the prime divisors of `B`. So, you need to make sure that you consider all the prime divisors of `B`. For example, if `B` is divisible by `2` and `3`, you need to check whether `A` is divisible by both `2` and `3`.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The logic you use to solve the problem should be correct. For example, if you simply check whether `A` is divisible by `B`, your logic will be incorrect. This is because `A` may be divisible by `B` even if it does not contain all the prime divisors of `B`.

**4. Not handling corner cases**

You should always handle corner cases when solving a problem. For example, the input may contain a negative number or a number that is equal to zero. You should make sure that your code handles these corner cases correctly.

**5. Not using efficient algorithms**

You should always try to use efficient algorithms to solve a problem. For example, you can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all the prime divisors of a number. This algorithm is much more efficient than simply checking whether a number is divisible by each prime number from 2 to the square root of the number.

Title:
CODECHEF iitk1p11

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not specified clearly.** The problem statement does not specify the input format. It is possible that the input is a list of numbers, or a string of numbers, or a single number. The developer needs to make sure that they understand the input format correctly before they start writing the code.
2. **The output format is not specified clearly.** The problem statement does not specify the output format. It is possible that the output is a list of numbers, or a string of numbers, or a single number. The developer needs to make sure that they understand the output format correctly before they start writing the code.
3. **The problem is not well-defined.** The problem statement does not specify what it means for Devu to "not need to use any carries". It is possible that the developer interprets this phrase differently than the intended meaning. The developer needs to make sure that they understand the problem statement correctly before they start writing the code.
4. **The problem is too difficult.** The problem statement asks the developer to solve a difficult problem. The developer may not have the necessary skills or knowledge to solve the problem. The developer should consider whether they are able to solve the problem before they start writing the code.
5. **The problem is not interesting.** The problem statement does not ask the developer to solve a problem that is interesting or challenging. The developer may not be motivated to solve the problem. The developer should consider whether they are interested in solving the problem before they start writing the code.

Title:
CODECHEF ncc3

Pain points:
1. **Using the wrong data type**. The problem states that N and M can be very large, so we need to use a data type that can store such large values. For example, if we use int, we will get an overflow error.
2. **Using incorrect modulo operator**. The problem states that we need to find X such that X = (N^M)%K. However, if we use the modulo operator (%) incorrectly, we will get the wrong answer. For example, if we have N = 10 and M = 100 and K = 10, then the correct answer is 1, but if we use the modulo operator incorrectly, we will get the answer 0.
3. **Using incorrect exponentiation algorithm**. The problem states that we need to find X such that X = (N^M)%K. However, if we use an incorrect exponentiation algorithm, we will get the wrong answer. For example, if we use the following algorithm to calculate X:

```
X = 1
for i in range(M):
  X = (X * N) % K
```

This algorithm will not work correctly if N is negative or if M is very large.
4. **Not handling overflow correctly**. The problem states that N and M can be very large, so we need to be careful about overflow. For example, if we have N = 10^100000 and M = 10^200, then the product of N and M will be too large to fit in a 64-bit integer.
5. **Not handling negative numbers correctly**. The problem states that N and M can be negative, so we need to be careful about negative numbers. For example, if we have N = -1 and M = 2, then the correct answer is -1, but if we use the incorrect exponentiation algorithm, we will get the answer 1.
6. **Not handling special cases correctly**. The problem states that K can be 1, so we need to handle this case correctly. For example, if we have N = 10 and M = 100 and K = 1, then the correct answer is 1, but if we use the incorrect exponentiation algorithm, we will get the wrong answer 0.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1023_B. Pair of Toys

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is specified in the problem statement. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will likely produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The problem statement specifies that the input should be two integers. If the input contains anything other than two integers, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will likely produce incorrect output.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When computing the number of ways to choose a pair of toys, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, if the total cost of the pair of toys is k, you might accidentally count the pairs (1, k-1) and (k-1, 1) twice.

**4. Undefined behavior**

The C++ standard does not specify what happens when you divide by zero. If you divide the total cost of the pair of toys by 2, you might get an undefined result, which could lead to incorrect output.

**5. Memory leaks**

If you do not free the memory that you allocate, you will eventually run out of memory and your program will crash.

**6. Race conditions**

If multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time, it is possible for them to corrupt each other's data. This can lead to incorrect results or even a crash.

**7. Deadlocks**

If two threads are each waiting for the other to release a lock, they can deadlock. This means that neither thread will ever be able to continue, and your program will hang.

**8. Security vulnerabilities**

If your program is not properly written, it can be vulnerable to security attacks. For example, your program might allow a malicious user to execute arbitrary code on your computer.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1044_C. Optimal Polygon Perimeter

Pain points:
### Possible problems

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer `n`. However, if the input contains multiple integers on the first line, or if `n` is not an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that each line should contain a single integer. However, if the output contains multiple integers on a line, or if a line does not contain an integer, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect calculation of perimeter.** The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of its sides. However, if the program incorrectly calculates the length of a side, or if it adds the lengths of the sides in the wrong order, the calculated perimeter will be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect handling of self-intersecting polygons.** The problem statement specifies that the polygons must not be self-intersecting. However, if the program incorrectly identifies a polygon as self-intersecting, or if it incorrectly draws a polygon, the calculated perimeter will be incorrect.
5. **Incorrect handling of degenerate polygons.** A degenerate polygon is a polygon with zero area. The problem statement does not specify how to handle degenerate polygons. However, if the program incorrectly handles degenerate polygons, the calculated perimeter will be incorrect.

### Possible bugs

1. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are common in programming, and they can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program iterates over the points in a polygon starting from the wrong index, or if it calculates the length of a side incorrectly, the calculated perimeter will be incorrect.
2. **Array out-of-bounds errors.** Array out-of-bounds errors occur when the program attempts to access an element of an array that does not exist. For example, if the program attempts to access the first element of an array that has no elements, or if it attempts to access the last element of an array that has a finite length, the program will crash.
3. **Memory leaks.** Memory leaks occur when the program allocates memory that it does not free. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
4. **Race conditions.** Race conditions occur when two or more threads attempt to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
5. **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can lead to the program being stuck in an infinite loop.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1067_B. Multihedgehog

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain a non-integer number, or a number that is out of the specified range. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input and output values may not be correctly specified. For example, the input may contain a string when it should contain an integer, or vice versa. This can also cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect. For example, the program may not correctly check if the input graph is a k-multihedgehog, or it may incorrectly output the answer. This can also cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the program does not correctly account for the size of an array or other data structure. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
5. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when the program does not correctly free up memory that it has allocated. This can eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
6. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more parts of the program try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output or crash.
7. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more parts of the program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish because it is waiting for the other to finish. This can cause the program to run indefinitely or crash.
8. **Uncaught exceptions**. Uncaught exceptions occur when the program encounters an error that it cannot handle. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
9. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can occur when the program does not correctly protect sensitive data. This can allow attackers to access or modify data that they should not be able to access.
10. **Performance issues**. Performance issues can occur when the program is not written efficiently. This can cause the program to run slowly or use too much memory.

CODEFORCES 1089_L. Lazyland

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined in the problem statement. A developer may incorrectly parse the input and get a wrong answer.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not strictly defined in the problem statement. A developer may incorrectly format the output and get a wrong answer.

**3. Undefined behavior**

The problem statement does not specify what to do if there are no jobs left to be done. A developer may incorrectly assume that the answer is 0, and get a wrong answer.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

**5. Memory leaks**

The developer may not properly free the memory allocated for the input and output data. This may lead to a memory leak.

**6. Time complexity**

The developer may implement an algorithm with a time complexity that is too high. This may lead to a timeout error.

**7. Space complexity**

The developer may implement an algorithm with a space complexity that is too high. This may lead to a memory error.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1108_E2. Array and Segments (Hard version)

Pain points:
### Possible problems and bugs

1. **Incorrect input format:** The input format of the problem is not strictly defined. For example, it is not clear whether the segments should be represented as `[l, r]` or `[l, r]`. This can lead to errors in the code if the developer does not correctly parse the input.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm:** The algorithm for finding the maximum possible value of `max(b_i) - min(b_i)` is not trivial. A developer may make mistakes in the implementation of the algorithm, which can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases:** The problem statement specifies several edge cases, such as the case where the array is empty or the case where there are no segments. A developer must be careful to handle these edge cases correctly, or the code may not work as expected.
4. **Incorrect use of data structures:** The problem requires the use of data structures such as arrays and lists. A developer must be careful to use these data structures correctly, or the code may not work as expected.
5. **Incorrect error handling:** The problem may throw errors if the input is invalid. A developer must be careful to handle these errors correctly, or the code may crash.

### How to avoid these problems

1. **Read the problem statement carefully:** The problem statement contains important information about the input format, the output format, and the constraints on the solution. A developer must read the problem statement carefully to avoid making mistakes.
2. **Test your code thoroughly:** A developer should test their code thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly. This includes testing the code with different input data, edge cases, and invalid input.
3. **Use a debugger:** A debugger can be helpful for finding errors in your code. A debugger allows you to step through your code line by line and see what is happening.
4. **Ask for help:** If you are stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help. There are many online resources available, such as forums, blogs, and Stack Overflow.

CODEFORCES 1138_B. Circus

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format of the problem is very specific. Make sure that you read and understand it carefully before starting to code.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format of the problem is also very specific. Make sure that you read and understand it carefully before starting to code.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When counting the number of artists, clowns, or acrobats, it is easy to make a mistake and count one artist twice or miss one artist entirely. Be careful to check your work carefully for these types of errors.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the problem is not always straightforward. Make sure that you understand the problem before you start coding, and that your code correctly implements the logic.
5. **Runtime errors.** The problem may have a time limit, so it is important to make sure that your code runs efficiently. Avoid using inefficient algorithms or data structures, and make sure that your code is well-optimized.
6. **Memory errors.** The problem may have a memory limit, so it is important to make sure that your code does not use too much memory. Avoid allocating large arrays or objects, and make sure that you free any memory that you no longer need.
7. **Compilation errors.** Make sure that your code compiles without any errors. This may seem like a trivial step, but it is often overlooked and can lead to problems later on.
8. **Testing errors.** It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed earlier.
9. **Presentation errors.** Make sure that your code is well-formatted and easy to read. This will make it easier for the judges to understand your code and to give you a fair rating.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1156_D. 0-1-Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of DFS**. The most common mistake is to incorrectly implement the DFS traversal. For example, you may forget to mark the visited vertices or you may not update the subtree size correctly.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of valid pairs**. Once you have correctly implemented the DFS traversal, you need to calculate the number of valid pairs. A common mistake is to forget to divide the number of pairs by 2.
3. **Incorrect handling of the input**. Make sure that you correctly parse the input and that you handle all possible edge cases. For example, you need to handle the case where the input is invalid or the tree is not acyclic.
4. **Time complexity**. The time complexity of your solution should be O(n). If your solution is too slow, you may need to optimize it.
5. **Memory usage**. The memory usage of your solution should be O(n). If your solution uses too much memory, you may need to optimize it.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

* Use a good data structure to represent the tree. A good data structure will make it easier to implement the DFS traversal and to calculate the number of valid pairs.
* Carefully test your code on a variety of input examples. This will help you to identify and fix any bugs in your code.
* Use a debugger to help you track down bugs. A debugger can help you to see what your code is doing and to identify the source of any errors.
* Ask for help from others. If you are stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help from a friend, family member, or online community.

CODEFORCES 1363_B. Subsequence Hate

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of `s.find()`**. This function returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring in the string. If the substring is not found, it returns -1. In the following code, `s.find("101")` returns -1 if the substring `"101"` is not found in the string `s`. This will cause the program to crash.

```
s = input()
if s.find("101") == -1:
    print("0")
else:
    print("1")
```

2. **Incorrect use of `s.count()`**. This function returns the number of occurrences of the substring in the string. In the following code, `s.count("101")` returns the number of occurrences of the substring `"101"` in the string `s`. This value can be used to determine the number of operations required to make the string good.

```
s = input()
count = s.count("101")
print(count)
```

3. **Incorrect use of `s.replace()`**. This function replaces all occurrences of the substring in the string with the specified replacement string. In the following code, `s.replace("101", "")` replaces all occurrences of the substring `"101"` in the string `s` with the empty string. This will remove all occurrences of the substring from the string.

```
s = input()
s = s.replace("101", "")
print(s)
```

4. **Incorrect use of `s.strip()`**. This function removes all leading and trailing whitespace from the string. In the following code, `s.strip()` removes all leading and trailing whitespace from the string `s`. This will make the string more readable.

```
s = input()
s = s.strip()
print(s)
```

5. **Incorrect use of `s.lower()`**. This function converts all characters in the string to lowercase. In the following code, `s.lower()` converts all characters in the string `s` to lowercase. This will make the string easier to read.

```
s = input()
s = s.lower()
print(s)

Title:
CODEFORCES 292_B. Network Topology

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is given in the form of two space-separated integers n and m. The first integer n represents the number of nodes in the graph, and the second integer m represents the number of edges in the graph. However, if the input data is not in the correct format, the program will not be able to correctly parse the data and will produce an incorrect output. For example, if the input data is given as "4 3 a 2 3 4", the program will not be able to correctly parse the data and will produce an incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect number of nodes or edges**

The input data also specifies the number of nodes and edges in the graph. If the number of nodes or edges in the input data does not match the number of nodes or edges in the graph, the program will not be able to correctly parse the data and will produce an incorrect output. For example, if the input data specifies that there are 4 nodes in the graph, but the graph actually contains 5 nodes, the program will not be able to correctly parse the data and will produce an incorrect output.

**3. Duplicate edges**

The input data also specifies that there is at most one edge between any two nodes. If the input data contains two edges between the same two nodes, the program will not be able to correctly parse the data and will produce an incorrect output. For example, if the input data contains the edges "1 2" and "2 1", the program will not be able to correctly parse the data and will produce an incorrect output.

**4. Self-loops**

The input data also specifies that no edge connects a node with itself. If the input data contains an edge that connects a node with itself, the program will not be able to correctly parse the data and will produce an incorrect output. For example, if the input data contains the edge "1 1", the program will not be able to correctly parse the data and will produce an incorrect output.

**5. Non-connected graph**

The input data also specifies that the graph is connected. If the graph is not connected, the program will not be able to correctly parse the data and will produce an incorrect output. For example, if the input data contains the edges "1 2" and "2 3", but does not contain any edges that connect 1 to 3, the graph will not be connected and the program will not be able to correctly parse the data.

## Possible Problems and Bugs

### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format for this problem is quite specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading it. For example, you might accidentally miss a comma or put the values in the wrong order. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

To avoid this problem, make sure to carefully read the input format and double-check your code before running it. You can also use a debugger to help you track down any errors.

### 2. Overflow errors

When working with large numbers, it's important to be aware of the possibility of overflow errors. This can happen when a number is too large to be represented by the data type you're using. For example, if you try to store a number larger than 2^31-1 in a 32-bit integer, the value will be truncated and you'll lose data.

To avoid overflow errors, make sure to use the correct data type for your numbers. If you need to work with very large numbers, you can use a library like GMP or Python's `bigint` module.

### 3. Off-by-one errors

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when you forget to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can cause the program to skip over or repeat a step, which can lead to incorrect output.

To avoid off-by-one errors, make sure to carefully check your code for any missing or incorrect increments or decrements. You can also use a debugger to help you track down these errors.

### 4. Indexing errors

When working with arrays or lists, it's important to be careful about indexing. If you index an array out of bounds, the program will crash.

To avoid indexing errors, make sure to check the bounds of your arrays before you index them. You can also use a debugger to help you track down these errors.

### 5. Logical errors

Logical errors are errors that occur when the program does something that the programmer didn't intend. For example, the program might loop forever or print incorrect output.

To avoid logical errors, make sure to carefully review your code and think about all the possible ways it could be used. You can also use a debugger to help you track down these errors.

### 6. Undefined behavior

Undefined behavior occurs when the program does something that the compiler doesn't know how to handle. This can happen when you use a function in a way that the compiler doesn't expect, or when you divide by zero.

Undefined behavior can lead to unpredictable results, such as crashes or security vulnerabilities. To avoid undefined behavior, make sure to use the functions and operators correctly. You can also use a compiler flag like `-Werror` to warn you about undefined behavior.

### 7. Memory errors

Memory errors can occur when the program tries to access memory that it doesn't have permission to access. This can happen when you try to free memory that's still in use, or when you try to allocate memory that doesn't exist.

To avoid memory errors, make sure to free memory that you're no longer using. You can also use a memory checker like Valgrind to help you track down these errors.

### 8. Race conditions

Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to unpredictable results, such as data corruption or crashes.

To avoid race conditions, make sure to use synchronization primitives to ensure that only one thread can access the data at a time. You can also use a thread checker like ThreadSanitizer to help you track down these errors.

### 9. Deadlocks

Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can lead to the threads being stuck in an infinite loop, waiting for each other to do something that they can never do.

To avoid deadlocks, make sure to release resources as soon as you're done with them. You can also use a deadlock detector like Helgrind to help you track down these errors.

### 10. Security vulnerabilities

Security vulnerabilities can occur when the program allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system. This can happen when the program uses insecure functions, or when it doesn't properly validate user input.

To avoid security vulnerabilities, make sure to use secure coding practices. You can also use a security scanner like OSS-Fuzz to help you find these vulnerabilities.

### Conclusion

These are just a few of the possible problems and bugs that you might encounter when solving this problem. By being aware of these potential issues, you can increase your chances of writing correct

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always followed correctly. For example, the input may contain non-integer values, or it may not contain the correct number of values.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not always followed correctly. For example, the output may contain non-integer values, or it may not contain the correct number of values.
3. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not find the correct solution, or it may take too long to run.
4. **Incorrect data.** The data used to test the program may be incorrect. For example, the data may contain duplicate values, or it may not contain enough values to test the program properly.
5. **Incorrect assumptions.** The programmer may make incorrect assumptions about the input data or the problem itself. For example, the programmer may assume that the input data is always valid, or that the problem can be solved in a certain way.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the program thoroughly with a variety of different data sets.

Title:
CODEFORCES 387_A. George and Sleep

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is very strict, and any deviation from it will cause the program to fail. For example, if the time is not in the format "hh:mm", or if the time is not in the 24-hour format, the program will not be able to process it correctly.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the sleep time.** The sleep time is calculated by subtracting the current time from the time George woke up. However, it is important to remember that George could have gone to bed yesterday, so the sleep time may be negative.
3. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is also very strict, and any deviation from it will cause the program to fail. For example, if the time is not in the format "hh:mm", or if the time is not separated by a colon, the program will not be able to process it correctly.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the sleep time, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. For example, if the current time is 05:50 and the sleep time is 05:44, the correct answer is 00:06, but a common mistake is to calculate the sleep time as 05:49, which would give the incorrect answer of 00:05.
5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the program may not be able to handle negative numbers, or it may not be able to handle times that are outside of the 24-hour format.

**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain spaces between the integers, or the integers may be separated by other characters. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the bark time**

The bark time is calculated by adding the bark interval to the first bark time. However, if the bark interval is not a multiple of 2, the bark time may be incorrect.

Title:
CODEFORCES 877_A. Alex and broken contest

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specified in the problem statement is "The only line contains string from lowercase and uppercase letters and \"_\" symbols of length, not more than 100 — the name of the problem.". A developer may incorrectly parse the input and fail to account for cases where the input string is not a valid name of a problem (e.g., it contains characters other than letters, numbers, and underscores, or it is longer than 100 characters).
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specified in the problem statement is "Print \"YES\", if problem is from this contest, and \"NO\" otherwise.". A developer may incorrectly format the output and fail to print the correct answer.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic for determining whether a problem is from the contest is as follows:
    1. Split the input string into words using the underscore character as a delimiter.
    2. Check if each word is the name of one of Alex's friends.
    3. If all of the words are valid names of Alex's friends, then the problem is from the contest. Otherwise, the problem is not from the contest.
    A developer may incorrectly implement this logic and fail to correctly determine whether a problem is from the contest.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating over the words in the input string, a developer may accidentally iterate one index too far or one index too few. This can result in incorrect results.
5. **Memory leaks**. A developer may incorrectly manage memory and create memory leaks. This can lead to the program crashing or consuming excessive amounts of memory.
6. **Race conditions**. If multiple threads are accessing the same data concurrently, a developer may not properly synchronize access to the data and cause data corruption. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. A developer may introduce security vulnerabilities into the program by not properly validating user input or by failing to protect sensitive data. This can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or to the data it stores.

CODEFORCES 900_B. Position in Fraction

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be three single positive integers a, b, c (1 ≤ a < b ≤ 105, 0 ≤ c ≤ 9). If the input is not in the correct format, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the decimal representation of the fraction.** The decimal representation of the fraction is calculated by dividing the numerator by the denominator. If the denominator is zero, the division will result in an error.
3. **Incorrect search for the first occurrence of the digit c in the decimal representation of the fraction.** The search should start from the second digit after the decimal point. If the digit c is not found in the decimal representation of the fraction, the program should print -1.
4. **Incorrect output.** The output should be the position of the first occurrence of the digit c in the decimal representation of the fraction. The position is numbered from 1 after the decimal point. If the digit c is not found in the decimal representation of the fraction, the program should print -1.

Here are some tips to avoid these problems:

1. Make sure that the input is in the correct format.
2. Use a function to calculate the decimal representation of the fraction. This function should handle the case where the denominator is zero.
3. Use a loop to search for the first occurrence of the digit c in the decimal representation of the fraction. The loop should start from the second digit after the decimal point.
4. Make sure that the output is correct. The output should be the position of the first occurrence of the digit c in the decimal representation of the fraction. The position is numbered from 1 after the decimal point. If the digit c is not found in the decimal representation of the fraction, the program should print -1.

CODEFORCES 950_B. Intercepted Message

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The input variables `n` and `m` are declared as integers, but the input values are strings. This will cause a type error.
2. **Incorrect comparison:** The condition `x1 + ... + xn = y1 + ... + ym` is incorrect. The correct condition is `x1 + ... + xn == y1 + ... + ym`.
3. **Off-by-one error:** The output should be the maximum number of files in the archive, but the code prints the number of blocks in the archive.
4. **Incorrect logic:** The code assumes that the order of files is kept while transferring archives through the network. This is not always the case.
5. **Memory leak:** The code does not free the memory allocated for the arrays `x` and `y`. This can lead to a memory leak.
6. **Security vulnerability:** The code does not check the input for malicious content. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.
7. **Incorrect error handling:** The code does not handle errors gracefully. If an error occurs, the code simply exits without printing any output.
8. **Unclear code:** The code is not well-commented and is difficult to understand. This makes it difficult to debug and maintain.

Title:
CODEFORCES 998_D. Roman Digits

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specified in the problem statement is "The only line of the input file contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the number of roman digits to use.". If the input format is not correct, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of distinct integers.** The number of distinct integers that can be represented by exactly n roman digits is given by the following formula:

```
C(n + 3, 3) - C(n + 2, 2)
```

where `C(n, k)` is the binomial coefficient. If the formula is not used correctly, the program may produce incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the number of distinct integers, it is important to make sure that all possible cases are accounted for. For example, if the number of roman digits is 2, the following integers can be represented: 2, 6, 10, 11, 15, 20, 51, 55, 60, and 100. It is important to make sure that all of these integers are included in the count.
4. **Memory errors.** If the program does not allocate enough memory, it may crash or produce incorrect output. It is important to make sure that the program allocates enough memory for all of the data that it needs to store.
5. **Time complexity.** The time complexity of the program should be O(n). If the program has a higher time complexity, it may not be able to solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time.

Title:
HACKEREARTH beginners-task

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly identifying the type of input.** The input is a list of integers, but the developer may incorrectly assume that it is a list of strings or characters. This could lead to errors when trying to access the elements of the list.
2. **Using the wrong data type for the elements of the list.** The elements of the list are integers, so the developer should use the `int` data type when storing them. Using the wrong data type could lead to errors when trying to perform mathematical operations on the elements of the list.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm to find the frequency of best numbers.** The best numbers are numbers that are divisible by 2. The developer can use a simple algorithm to find the frequency of best numbers. The algorithm should iterate through the list of integers and count the number of elements that are divisible by 2.
4. **Incorrectly handling edge cases.** There are a few edge cases that the developer should be aware of when solving this problem. For example, the list of integers may be empty, or it may contain only one element. The developer should handle these edge cases gracefully.
5. **Not using proper error handling.** The developer should use proper error handling to ensure that the program does not crash if there is an error. For example, the developer should check if the input is valid before trying to process it.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer may incorrectly assume that the input is a list of strings or characters. This could lead to errors when trying to access the elements of the list. For example, the developer may try to use the `int` function to convert a string to an integer, which would cause an error.
* The developer may use the wrong data type for the elements of the list. For example, the developer may use the `str` data type to store integers, which would cause errors when trying to perform mathematical operations on the elements of the list.
* The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to find the frequency of best numbers. For example, the developer may try to use a brute-force algorithm to find the frequency of best numbers, which would be very inefficient.
* The developer may incorrectly handle edge cases. For example, the developer may not handle the case where the list of integers is empty. This would cause the program to crash.
* The developer may not use proper error handling. For example, the developer may not check if the input is valid before trying to process it. This could lead to the program crashing if the input is invalid.

Title:
HACKEREARTH coins-11

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly checking if a number is prime.** A common mistake is to check if a number is prime by dividing it by all numbers from 2 to the square root of the number. This is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility that the number is divisible by a prime number greater than the square root of the number. For example, 11 is not divisible by any number from 2 to 3, but it is divisible by 3, which is a prime number greater than 3.
2. **Not considering all possible ways to split a coin.** When splitting a coin, you need to consider all possible ways to do so. For example, if you have a coin with the value 11, you could split it into two coins with the values 5 and 6, or you could split it into three coins with the values 2, 4, and 5.
3. **Using an inefficient algorithm.** There are more efficient algorithms than the brute-force algorithm that is used in the solution above. For example, the Sieve of Eratosthenes can be used to quickly find all prime numbers up to a given number.
4. **Not handling special cases correctly.** There are a few special cases that need to be handled correctly when solving this problem. For example, if the input number is 1, then you can take it home without splitting it.
5. **Making a mistake in the implementation.** Even a small mistake in the implementation of the algorithm can lead to incorrect results. For example, if you accidentally divide the input number by 0, then the program will crash.

Title:
HACKEREARTH fast-and-furious

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The problem states that `N` is an integer, but the solution code uses `N` as a float. This will cause the code to produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect loop condition.** The solution code uses a `while` loop to iterate over the values of `N`, but the condition of the loop is incorrect. The loop should check if `N` is greater than or equal to 2, not greater than or equal to 1.
3. **Incorrect calculation.** The solution code calculates the minimum number of soldiers that may have been alive at the end of the war by dividing `N` by 3. However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that some soldiers may have been killed in the first two turns of the war.
4. **Incorrect output.** The solution code prints the minimum number of soldiers that may have been alive at the end of the war, but it does not print the answer in a new line. This will cause the output to be incorrect.

To fix these problems, you can:

1. Change the variable type of `N` to `int`.
2. Correct the condition of the `while` loop.
3. Calculate the minimum number of soldiers that may have been alive at the end of the war by subtracting the number of soldiers that were killed in the first two turns from `N`.
4. Print the answer in a new line.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. The developer should check the input format and handle incorrect input gracefully.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not always correct. For example, the output may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be formatted correctly. The developer should check the output format and make sure it is correct.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the danger value**. The danger value is the maximum difference of hunger values of all the adjacent seated animals. The developer should calculate the danger value correctly.
4. **Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm**. The greedy algorithm is a simple algorithm that tries to find a local optimum. It is not guaranteed to find the global optimum. The developer should implement the greedy algorithm correctly and make sure it finds the global optimum.
5. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. There are some edge cases that the developer should handle correctly. For example, what if the number of animals is 1? What if all the animals have the same hunger value? The developer should handle these edge cases gracefully.
6. **Incorrect use of data structures**. The developer should use the correct data structures to store the data. For example, the developer should use a list to store the hunger values of the animals.
7. **Incorrect use of algorithms**. The developer should use the correct algorithms to solve the problem. For example, the developer should use the greedy algorithm to find the minimum danger value.
8. **Incorrect error handling**. The developer should handle errors gracefully. For example, what if the developer runs out of memory? The developer should handle this error gracefully.
9. **Incorrect unit testing**. The developer should write unit tests to test the code. The unit tests should test all the possible scenarios.
10. **Incorrect integration testing**. The developer should write integration tests to test the code. The integration tests should test the code with real data.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not clearly defined in the problem statement. It is possible that a developer may misinterpret the input format and make a mistake.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not clearly defined in the problem statement. It is possible that a developer may misinterpret the output format and make a mistake.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. The problem statement mentions that "word 1 is swapped with word W, word 2 is swapped with word W-1 and so on". It is possible that a developer may misinterpret this and make an off-by-one error.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. The problem statement does not explicitly mention any edge cases. It is possible that a developer may miss an edge case and make a mistake.
5. **Memory leaks**. The problem statement does not mention any memory constraints. It is possible that a developer may allocate too much memory or not free memory when it is no longer needed, leading to a memory leak.
6. **Race conditions**. The problem statement does not mention any concurrency constraints. It is possible that a developer may write code that is not thread-safe, leading to a race condition.

HACKEREARTH pythagorean-triplets-15

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Pythagorean theorem.** The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This means that for any three integers a, b, and c, if a^2 + b^2 = c^2, then a, b, and c form a Pythagorean triplet. However, many developers incorrectly implement the Pythagorean theorem as a^2 + b^2 = c^3, which will not always produce a valid Pythagorean triplet.
2. **Using an incorrect range for the loop.** The loop in the solution should iterate over all possible values of a, b, and c from 1 to N. However, many developers incorrectly iterate over a range that is too small or too large.
3. **Using an incorrect comparison operator.** The comparison operator in the loop should be <=, not <. This is because the loop should iterate over all possible values of a, b, and c up to and including N.
4. **Not handling the case where N is not a perfect square.** If N is not a perfect square, then there will not be any Pythagorean triplets with c equal to N. In this case, the solution should simply return 0.
5. **Not handling the case where N is negative.** The Pythagorean theorem only applies to right triangles with positive sides. In the case where N is negative, the solution should simply return 0.

Title:
HACKEREARTH you-just-went-full-retard-never-go-full-retard-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly checking if a number is prime.** A common mistake is to check if a number is divisible by every number from 2 to the square root of the number. This is incorrect because a number can be divisible by a number greater than its square root. For example, 10 is divisible by 5, which is greater than its square root of 3.
2. **Using an incorrect algorithm to check if a number is prime.** There are many different algorithms for checking if a number is prime. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. It is important to use an efficient algorithm to avoid wasting time on unnecessary calculations.
3. **Using incorrect data types.** When checking if a number is prime, it is important to use the correct data type. For example, if a number is very large, it should be stored as a long integer rather than an integer. Using the wrong data type can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Not handling special cases correctly.** There are a few special cases that need to be handled correctly when checking if a number is prime. For example, the number 1 is not prime, and the number 0 is not considered to be a prime number either.
5. **Not using a robust error handling strategy.** It is important to have a robust error handling strategy in place when checking if a number is prime. This means that the code should be able to handle any errors that might occur, such as invalid input or divide by zero errors.

Title:
ATCODER p02661 AtCoder Beginner Contest 169 - Count Median

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the binary search algorithm.** The binary search algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that can be used to find the position of a target value in a sorted array. However, if the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Using the wrong data type for the input values.** The input values in this problem are integers. If the data type for the input values is not specified, the compiler may use a data type that is too small, which can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Not handling boundary cases correctly.** The boundary cases in this problem include the case where the array is empty, the case where the target value is not in the array, and the case where the array contains duplicate values. If these boundary cases are not handled correctly, it can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Using floating-point numbers incorrectly.** Floating-point numbers are not always precise, and this can lead to incorrect results if they are used incorrectly. In this problem, it is important to use integers for all calculations, and to avoid using floating-point numbers unless absolutely necessary.
5. **Using global variables incorrectly.** Global variables are variables that are accessible from anywhere in the program. If global variables are not used correctly, it can lead to problems with data consistency and race conditions. In this problem, it is not necessary to use global variables, and it is better to use local variables instead.
6. **Not using a unit test framework.** Unit tests are small tests that verify the correctness of individual units of code. Using a unit test framework can help to catch bugs early in the development process, and can also help to ensure that the code is correct. In this problem, it would be helpful to use a unit test framework to verify the correctness of the binary search algorithm.

Title:
ATCODER p02790 AtCoder Beginner Contest 152 - Comparing Strings

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that `a` and `b` should be 1-digit positive integers. However, a developer might accidentally enter a string or a negative integer, which would cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect comparison of strings.** The program must compare the two strings lexicographically, which means that the string with the smaller characters should come first. A developer might accidentally compare the strings in the wrong order, which would lead to the wrong answer.
3. **Incorrect output format.** The program must print the lexicographically smaller of the two strings. A developer might accidentally print the larger string, or they might print the strings in the wrong order.
4. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem, such as incorrect variable initialization, incorrect logic, and incorrect error handling.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the constraints. It is also important to test the program thoroughly with a variety of input values.

Title:
ATCODER p02926 AtCoder Beginner Contest 139 - Engines

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is given as integers, but the output should be a real value. If you accidentally use an integer data type for the output, you will get a wrong answer.

**2. Not considering the order of the engines**

The problem states that the engines can be used in any order. However, if you only consider the absolute values of the x- and y-coordinates of the engines, you may get a wrong answer. For example, consider the following input:

```
3
1 1
1 0
0 1
```

If you only consider the absolute values of the x- and y-coordinates, you will get the answer `2.828427124746190097603377448419396157139343750753`. However, the correct answer is `2.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`. This is because the engines can be used in any order, and the order in which they are used can affect the final distance from the origin.

**3. Not using the Pythagorean theorem**

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this problem, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the maximum possible distance from the origin.

**4. Not using the right formula**

The formula for the distance from a point to a line is given by

```
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
```

where `(x_1, y_1)` and `(x_2, y_2)` are the coordinates of the line. In this problem, we can use this formula to find the maximum possible distance from the origin.

**5. Not using the right algorithm**

The best algorithm for solving this problem is to use a greedy algorithm. A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that makes the best possible decision at each step, without considering the future. In this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm to find the maximum possible distance from the origin by always choosing the engine that will give us the biggest increase in distance.

Title:
ATCODER p03061 AtCoder Beginner Contest 125 - GCD on Blackboard

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is `3`, `7 6 8`, the program will expect the next integer to be the replacement value, but it is not there.
2. **Incorrect calculation of GCD**. The GCD of two integers is the largest integer that divides both of them. For example, the GCD of 6 and 8 is 2. However, if the two integers are not coprime, the GCD may not be the smallest possible value. For example, the GCD of 12 and 15 is 3, but the smallest possible value is 1.
3. **Incorrect choice of replacement value**. The replacement value should be as small as possible while still ensuring that the GCD of the new set of integers is maximized. For example, if the original set of integers is `7 6 8`, the replacement value should be 2, not 1.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the GCD of the new set of integers is 2, the output should be `2`, not `2.0`.

Title:
ATCODER p03205 AtCoder Grand Contest 029 - Construction of a tree

Pain points:
```
## Possible Problems

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of elements in a set is not specified, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input may not be correct, which may lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of elements in a set is specified as a string, the program may crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program does not check whether a tree is connected, it may output an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the program may not be correct, which may lead to errors in the submission. For example, if the program outputs the answer in a different format than the expected format, it may be rejected.

## Possible Bugs

1. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are common in programming, and they can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program iterates over a list of elements and misses one element, the results will be incorrect.
2. **Null pointer exceptions**. Null pointer exceptions occur when a program tries to access a memory location that does not exist. This can happen when a pointer is not initialized, or when a pointer is dereferenced after it has been freed.
3. **ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException**. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions occur when a program tries to access an element of an array that does not exist. This can happen when the index of the array is out of bounds.
4. **Stack overflow**. Stack overflows occur when a program uses up all of the available stack space. This can happen when a recursive function calls itself too many times.
5. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

## How to Avoid These Problems

1. **Test your code thoroughly**. The best way to avoid errors is to test your code thoroughly. This means running your code on a variety of input data and checking for errors.
2. **Use the right data types**. Make sure that you are using the correct data types for your variables. This will help to avoid errors caused by incorrect typecasting.
3. **Write clear and concise code**. Make sure that your code is easy to read and understand. This will help to identify and fix errors more easily.
4. **Use a debugger**. A debugger can be a helpful tool for finding and fixing errors in your code. A debugger allows you to step through your code line by line and watch how the variables change.
5. **Use online resources**. There are many online resources available to help you learn how to program and avoid errors. Some helpful resources include Stack Overflow, Codecademy, and Udacity.

Title:
ATCODER p03352 AtCoder Beginner Contest 097 - Exponential

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The developer may make a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may forget to check for overflow when computing the exponent of the perfect power, or may use an incorrect formula for computing the perfect power.
2. **Incorrect input handling.** The developer may not properly handle invalid input, such as a negative number or a number that is not an integer. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect output formatting.** The developer may not properly format the output of the program, which could make it difficult for the user to understand. For example, the developer may not print the output on a new line, or may use the wrong number of digits.
4. **Insufficient testing.** The developer may not test the program thoroughly, which could lead to bugs that are not caught until after the program is released. For example, the developer may not test the program with invalid input, or may not test the program with a variety of different inputs.
5. **Failure to meet deadlines.** The developer may not meet the deadlines for the project, which could lead to the project being delayed or canceled. This could be caused by a number of factors, such as underestimating the time required to complete the project, or having unexpected problems with the development process.

Title:
ATCODER p03512 Code Festival Team Relay (Parallel) - Akashic Records

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect understanding of the problem statement**

The problem statement is not very clear, so it is possible that a developer might misinterpret it. For example, a developer might think that the goal is to find the maximum value of `a_i` for any `i`, when in reality the goal is to find the maximum value of `a_j` for some fixed `j`.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The algorithm for solving this problem is not very complex, but it is still possible for a developer to make mistakes. For example, a developer might forget to initialize the array `a` to all zeros, or they might make a mistake in the loop that iterates over the operations.

**3. Runtime error**

The algorithm for solving this problem has a time complexity of `O(Q)`, where `Q` is the number of operations. If the input is large, this could cause the algorithm to run out of memory.

**4. Incorrect output**

The developer might incorrectly print the output of the algorithm. For example, they might print the maximum value of `a_i` for any `i`, when in reality they should be printing the maximum value of `a_j` for some fixed `j`.

**5. Wrong data type**

The developer might use the wrong data type to store the values of `a_i`. For example, they might use `int` instead of `long long`, which could lead to incorrect results.
Test inputs:
1. Incorrect understanding of the problem statement

```
Q = int(input())
for i in range(Q):
    m, x = map(int, input().split())
```

This code will not work because it is not clear what the goal is. Is the goal to find the maximum value of `a_i` for any `i`, or is the goal to find the maximum value of `a_j` for some fixed `j`?

2. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm

```
Q = int(input())
a = [0] * 100000000
for i in range(Q):
    m, x = map(int, input().split())
    for j in range(m, 100000000, m):
        a[j] += x
print(max(a))
```

This code will not work because it does not initialize the array `a` to all zeros.

3. Runtime error

```
Q = int(input())
for i in range(Q):
    m, x = map(int, input().split())
    for j in range(m, 100000000, m):
        a[j] += x
print(max(a))
```

This code will not work because it will run out of memory if the input is large.

4. Incorrect output

```
Q = int(input())
for i in range(Q):
    m, x = map(int, input().split())
    for j in range(m, 100000000, m):
        a[j] += x
print(max(a))
```

This code will not work because it will print the maximum value of `a_i` for any `i`, when in reality it should be printing the maximum value of `a_j` for some fixed `j`.

5. Wrong data type

```
Q = int(input())
for i in range(Q):
    m, x = map(int, input().split())
    for j in range(m, 100000000, m):
        a[j] += x
print(max(a))
```

This code will not work because it is using the wrong data type to store the values of `a_i`. The values of `a_i` can be very large, so they need to be stored as `long long`s.
Title:
ATCODER p03674 AtCoder Beginner Contest 066 - 11

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of this problem is:

```
n
a_1 a_2 ... a_{n+1}
```

where `n` is an integer and `a_i`s are integers between 1 and `n`. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash. For example, if the input is `3 1 2 3 4`, the program will crash because the number of elements in the input does not match `n`.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of this problem is:

```
n
a_1 a_2 ... a_{n+1}
```

where `n` is an integer and `a_i`s are integers between 1 and `n`. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be accepted. For example, if the output is `3 1 2 3 4`, the program will not be accepted because the number of elements in the output does not match `n`.

**3. Incorrect calculation**

The goal of this problem is to find the number of different subsequences of the given sequence with length `k`. A subsequence is a sequence that can be obtained by deleting some elements from the original sequence. For example, the subsequences of the sequence `1, 2, 3` are `1`, `2`, `3`, `1, 2`, `1, 3`, `2, 3`, and `1, 2, 3`.

To calculate the number of different subsequences of a sequence with length `k`, we can use the following formula:

```
N_k = N_{k-1} + N_{k-2} + ... + N_0
```

where `N_i` is the number of different subsequences of the sequence with length `i`.

**4. Overflow**

The answer to this problem can be very large. For example, the answer to the problem with input `32 29 19 7 10 26 32 27 4 11 20 2 8 16 23 5 14 6 12 17 22 18 30 28 24 15 1 25 3 13 21 19 31 9` is `818809200`. If we do not handle overflow, the program will crash.

To handle overflow, we can use the following method:

```
long long MOD = 1000000007;
long long N_k = 0;
for (int i = 0; i <= k; i++) {
    N_k = (N_k + N_i) % MOD;
}
```

This method will ensure that the answer is always less than or equal to `MOD`.

Title:
ATCODER p03828 AtCoder Beginner Contest 052 - Factors of Factorial

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**

When calculating the number of divisors of N!, it is important to use the modulo operator correctly. For example, if N = 10 and we want to find the number of divisors of 10!, we would need to calculate ```(10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) % 10^9 + 7```. However, if we accidentally used the modulo operator ```%``` instead of ```mod```, we would get the wrong answer of ```1092926972```.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

There are many different algorithms that can be used to calculate the number of divisors of a number. Some of these algorithms are more efficient than others. For example, the following algorithm is very inefficient:

```
def num_divisors(n):
  count = 1
  for i in range(2, n + 1):
    if n % i == 0:
      count += 1
  return count
```

This algorithm works by first finding all of the factors of n, and then adding them up. However, this algorithm is very inefficient because it has to iterate through all of the numbers from 2 to n. A more efficient algorithm would be to use the following formula:

```
num_divisors(n) = (n * (n + 1)) // 2
```

**3. Using incorrect data types**

When calculating the number of divisors of N!, it is important to use the correct data types. For example, if N is a large number, it is important to use a data type that can store large numbers. Otherwise, you may get an overflow error.

**4. Not handling edge cases correctly**

When calculating the number of divisors of N!, it is important to handle edge cases correctly. For example, if N = 0, the number of divisors of N! is 1. Similarly, if N = 1, the number of divisors of N! is 1.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is always important to test your code before submitting it to a competition. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed. You can test your code by using a sample input and output.
Test inputs:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**

```
N = int(input())
print((N * (N + 1)) // 2 % 10**9 + 7)
```

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

```
N = int(input())
print(sum(1 for i in range(2, N + 1) if N % i == 0))
```

**3. Using incorrect data types**

```
N = int(input())
print((N * (N + 1)) // 2)
```

**4. Not handling edge cases correctly**

```
N = int(input())
if N == 0:
    print(1)
elif N == 1:
    print(1)
else:
    print((N * (N + 1)) // 2)
```

**5. Not testing your code**

```
N = int(input())
print((N * (N + 1)) // 2 % 10**9 + 7)

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is very specific, and it is easy to make mistakes when reading the input. For example, you might accidentally read the number of rows as the number of columns, or you might forget to read the number of cells that have been filled in.
2. **Incorrect logic.** The solution to this problem is not trivial, and it is easy to make mistakes in the logic. For example, you might forget to consider the case where there are no cells that have been filled in, or you might not correctly account for the fact that the sum of the numbers in a 2x2 square must be the same in both directions.
3. **Incorrect output.** The output for this problem is very simple, but it is easy to make mistakes when writing it. For example, you might forget to capitalize the first letter of the word "Yes" or "No", or you might accidentally print the output to the wrong file.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to carefully write and test your code before submitting it.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input handling**. The input format is not well-defined. For example, it does not specify how to handle inputs with invalid dimensions or inputs with invalid characters. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, it may not take into account all of the constraints of the problem, or it may not be efficient enough. This could lead to the program running too slowly or producing incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect output handling**. The output format is not well-defined. For example, it does not specify how to handle cases where the minimum number of moves is not unique, or where there is no way to win the game. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect error handling**. The program may not handle errors correctly. For example, it may not handle invalid inputs gracefully, or it may not report errors when they occur. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
5. **Inefficient implementation**. The program may be inefficiently implemented. For example, it may use a brute-force approach that takes a long time to run, or it may use a data structure that is not well-suited for the problem. This could lead to the program running too slowly or using too much memory.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully design the program and test it thoroughly. They should also use a debugger to identify and fix any errors that are found.

Title:
AIZU p01441 Full Text Search

Pain points:
### Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect implementation of the bi-gram search method.** This is the most likely cause of the issue, as it could lead to incorrect results being returned. For example, if the bi-gram search method is implemented incorrectly, it could return a question text that does not contain the query string as-is, even if there is no such question text that is shorter.
* **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The bi-gram search method may need to be modified to handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the query string is empty, the bi-gram search method should return an empty set of results.
* **Insufficient testing.** The bi-gram search method should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it is working correctly. This includes testing with a variety of different query strings and question texts.
* **Insufficient documentation.** The bi-gram search method should be well-documented so that developers can understand how it works and how to use it correctly.

### Additional tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use a unit testing framework to test the bi-gram search method. This will help to ensure that the method is working correctly.
* Write clear and concise documentation for the bi-gram search method. This will help other developers to understand how to use the method correctly.
* Use a debugger to help you track down any bugs in the bi-gram search method. This will help you to identify the cause of the problem and fix it quickly.
