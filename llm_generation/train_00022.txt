CODECHEF amifib

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect logic to check if a number is Fibonacci.**

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

```
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1
```

A common mistake is to check if a number is Fibonacci by simply checking if it is equal to F(n) for some n. However, this is not sufficient, as there are many numbers that are not Fibonacci numbers but are equal to F(n) for some n. For example, 144 is not a Fibonacci number, but it is equal to F(24).

To correctly check if a number is Fibonacci, we need to use the following algorithm:

1. Initialize two variables, `f(0)` and `f(1)`, to 0 and 1, respectively.
2. Iterate over the numbers from 2 to `n`, and for each number, calculate `f(n)` as `f(n-1) + f(n-2)`.
3. If, at any point, `f(n)` is equal to the given number, then the number is Fibonacci. Otherwise, the number is not Fibonacci.

**2. Using incorrect data types.**

Another common mistake is to use incorrect data types when checking if a number is Fibonacci. For example, if the given number is a large integer, it may be necessary to use a `long` or `BigInteger` data type to avoid overflow errors.

**3. Not handling edge cases.**

It is also important to handle edge cases when checking if a number is Fibonacci. For example, the number 0 is not Fibonacci, but it is equal to `f(0)`. Similarly, the number 1 is Fibonacci, but it is equal to `f(1)`.

**4. Using inefficient algorithms.**

The Fibonacci sequence is a well-studied sequence, and there are many efficient algorithms for computing Fibonacci numbers. Using an inefficient algorithm can significantly increase the time required to check if a number is Fibonacci.

**5. Not using the right tools.**

There are many online tools available that can be used to check if a number is Fibonacci. Using these tools can save time and effort, and can help to ensure that the correct answer is obtained.

Title:
CODECHEF chefzot

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be a single line containing the number of elements in the array, followed by a newline, followed by a line containing the elements of the array, separated by spaces. For example, the input for the example problem should be `6` followed by a newline, followed by `1 0 2 3 0 4`.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer, the length of the longest subarray with non-zero product. For example, the output for the example problem should be `2`.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm should find the longest subarray with non-zero product in the given array. A simple algorithm is to start with the first element of the array and extend the subarray as long as possible, until the product of the elements in the subarray becomes zero. Then, move to the next element and repeat the process. The longest subarray found by this algorithm will be the longest subarray with non-zero product in the given array.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. When computing the length of the longest subarray with non-zero product, it is important to make sure that the index of the last element in the subarray is correct. For example, in the example problem, the longest subarray with non-zero product is `{2, 3}`, so the length of the subarray is 2. However, if the index of the last element in the subarray is computed incorrectly as 3, the length of the subarray will be incorrect as well.
5. **Memory errors**. The algorithm should be implemented in a way that it does not use too much memory. For example, the algorithm should not store the entire array in memory at once.
6. **Time complexity**. The algorithm should be implemented in a way that it runs in a reasonable amount of time. For example, the algorithm should not take longer than a few seconds to run on a typical computer.

Title:
CODECHEF dumpling

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specified in the problem statement is not followed. For example, if the input is `1 2 3 4 5`, the program should raise an error.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specified in the problem statement is not followed. For example, if the output is `3 4 5`, the program should raise an error.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program does not correctly calculate the number of possible positions to place the dumpling on the rope. For example, if the input is `1 2 3 4 5`, the program should output `3`, but it outputs `4`.
4. **Memory limit exceeded**. The program uses too much memory and runs out of memory. For example, if the input is a very large number, the program may run out of memory.
5. **Time limit exceeded**. The program takes too long to run and exceeds the time limit. For example, if the input is a very large number, the program may take too long to run.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the program with different input values to make sure that it is working correctly.

Title:
CODECHEF kgood

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not specified.**

The input format is not specified in the problem statement. This could lead to confusion for developers who are not familiar with the problem domain. For example, some developers might assume that the input format is a list of strings, while others might assume that it is a list of tuples.

**2. The output format is not specified.**

The output format is also not specified in the problem statement. This could lead to confusion for developers who are not familiar with the problem domain. For example, some developers might assume that the output format is a list of integers, while others might assume that it is a list of strings.

**3. The problem statement is not clear.**

The problem statement is not clear about what constitutes a "K-good" word. For example, does a word that contains two letters that appear the same number of times count as K-good for any value of K? Does a word that contains two letters that appear with a difference of K + 1 count as K-good?

**4. The problem is too difficult.**

The problem is too difficult for most developers to solve without a significant amount of research. For example, the problem requires developers to be familiar with the concept of dynamic programming.

**5. The problem is too easy.**

The problem is too easy for most developers to solve. For example, the problem can be solved by simply counting the number of letters in the word.

Title:
CODECHEF ojumps

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input is an integer, so we need to use an integer data type to store it. If we use a floating-point data type, it may cause rounding errors. For example, if we use a float to store the input 10, it will be rounded to 10.0, which is not equal to 10.

**2. Using incorrect logic**

The problem states that Chef will perform a lot of jumps in such a sequence: 1-jump, 2-jump, 3-jump, 1-jump, 2-jump, 3-jump, 1-jump, and so on. So we need to check if the input a can be reached by performing a sequence of 1-jumps, 2-jumps, and 3-jumps. A common mistake is to check if a is divisible by 1, 2, and 3. This is incorrect because a may not be divisible by 1, 2, or 3.

**3. Not handling the corner cases**

The problem states that the input a must be between 0 and 10^18. If the input is not in this range, we need to handle it accordingly. A common mistake is to simply ignore the input or to output an incorrect answer.

**4. Using inefficient algorithms**

The problem can be solved in O(1) time. However, a common mistake is to use a more inefficient algorithm, such as a brute-force algorithm. This will result in a slow program.

**5. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code to make sure that it is correct. A common mistake is to not test the code or to test it incorrectly. This can lead to bugs in the code that may not be caught until it is too late.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1005_D. Polycarp and Div 3

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format specifies that the first line of the input should contain a positive integer s. However, a developer may accidentally read a non-integer value, such as a string, into s. This would cause the program to crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format specifies that the program should print a single integer, the maximum number of numbers divisible by 3 that Polycarp can obtain. However, a developer may accidentally print multiple integers, or a non-integer value, such as a string. This would cause the program to produce incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not consider all possible cuts, or it may not correctly identify the numbers that are divisible by 3. This would cause the program to produce incorrect output.

**4. Incorrect error handling**

The program should handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input format is incorrect, the program should print an error message and exit. If the program encounters a runtime error, it should also print an error message and exit. This will help the user to identify and fix the problem.

**5. Unoptimized code**

The program may be unnecessarily slow. This could be due to inefficient algorithms, or to poor coding practices. The program can be optimized by using more efficient algorithms, and by writing more efficient code. This will improve the performance of the program and make it more responsive.

CODEFORCES 1071_B. Minimum path

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or it may contain two numbers instead of one. The developer should check the input format and raise an error if it is incorrect.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correctly followed. For example, the output may contain a string that is not a valid path, or it may contain two strings instead of one. The developer should check the output format and raise an error if it is incorrect.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the lexicographically smallest string**. The lexicographically smallest string is not always the string that is formed by all the letters in the cells the path visits. For example, if the path visits the cells (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), then the lexicographically smallest string is not "aaaaaaadudsnz", but "aaaaaaadudsnx". The developer should correctly calculate the lexicographically smallest string and output it.
4. **Incorrect handling of errors**. The developer should handle errors correctly. For example, if the input format is incorrect, the developer should raise an error and exit the program. If the output format is incorrect, the developer should raise an error and exit the program. If the calculation of the lexicographically smallest string is incorrect, the developer should raise an error and exit the program.
5. **Inefficient algorithm**. The developer should use an efficient algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the developer could use a dynamic programming algorithm to solve the problem.
6. **Memory leak**. The developer should make sure that there are no memory leaks in the program. For example, the developer should free all allocated memory when it is no longer needed.

CODEFORCES 1093_D. Beautiful Graph

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly parsed, which can lead to unexpected results. For example, if the input contains a number with more than 3 digits, it will be interpreted as an integer, which may not be what you intended.
2. **Incorrect use of modulo operator**. The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. This means that if you divide a number by another number and then take the modulo, you will get the remainder of the division. For example, 10 % 3 = 1. However, if you try to divide a number by zero, you will get an error.
3. **Incorrect use of factorial**. The factorial of a number is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number. For example, 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120. However, if you try to calculate the factorial of a negative number, you will get an error.
4. **Incorrect use of recursion**. Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself. This can be useful for solving certain problems, but it is important to be careful not to create infinite recursion loops.
5. **Incorrect use of dynamic programming**. Dynamic programming is a technique for storing the results of subproblems so that they can be reused later. This can be useful for solving certain problems, but it is important to be careful not to create duplicate subproblems.
6. **Incorrect use of bit manipulation**. Bit manipulation is a technique for manipulating individual bits of data. This can be useful for solving certain problems, but it is important to be careful not to make mistakes.
7. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers**. Floating-point numbers are numbers that have a decimal point. They are often used for representing real numbers, but they can be inaccurate and imprecise.
8. **Incorrect use of parallel programming**. Parallel programming is a technique for running multiple parts of a program at the same time. This can be useful for speeding up a program, but it is important to be careful not to introduce race conditions or deadlocks.
9. **Incorrect use of memory management**. Memory management is the process of allocating and freeing memory for a program. This can be a complex and error-prone task, so it is important to be careful not to make mistakes.
10. **Incorrect use of exceptions**. Exceptions are used to handle errors that occur during program execution. They can be useful for debugging a program, but it is important to be careful not to throw too many exceptions.

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input string should be a palindrome of lowercase Latin letters. If the input string is not a palindrome, the program will return an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer representing the minimum number of cuts needed to get a new name. If there is no answer, the program should print "Impossible".
3. **Incorrect logic.** The program should find the minimum number of cuts needed to get a new name by cutting the string into k + 1 parts and then uniting them in such a way that the final string will be a palindrome and it won't be equal to the initial string s. If there is no answer, the program should print "Impossible".
4. **Runtime error.** The program should run in a reasonable amount of time. If the program takes too long to run, it will be marked as incorrect.
5. **Memory error.** The program should not use too much memory. If the program uses too much memory, it will be marked as incorrect.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1141_F2. Same Sum Blocks (Hard)

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading in the data. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will likely crash.
* **Incorrect algorithm:** The algorithm for finding the maximum number of disjoint blocks with the same sum is not trivial, and it is easy to make a mistake in the implementation. For example, if you forget to update the running total of the sum of the elements in the current block, the program will likely output an incorrect answer.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format for this problem is also very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when printing the results. For example, if you forget to add a newline character between two blocks, the program will likely produce an incorrect output.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* **Be careful when reading in the input data.** Make sure to check that the input is in the correct format, and that you are correctly parsing the data into the appropriate variables.
* **Test your algorithm thoroughly.** Before submitting your solution, make sure to test it on a variety of different input data sets. This will help you to identify and fix any errors in your algorithm.
* **Be careful when printing the output.** Make sure to follow the exact output format specified in the problem statement. This will help you to avoid any errors in the output.

CODEFORCES 1162_A. Zoning Restrictions Again

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrectly calculating the maximum profit.** The developer may incorrectly calculate the maximum profit by not taking into account all of the restrictions. For example, in the first example, the developer may incorrectly calculate the maximum profit by only considering the first two restrictions and not the third restriction. This would result in an incorrect answer of 10 instead of 14.
2. **Incorrectly handling overlapping restrictions.** The developer may incorrectly handle overlapping restrictions by not considering the maximum height of the house in the overlapping region. For example, in the second example, the developer may incorrectly handle the overlapping restrictions on house 3 by only considering the first restriction and not the second restriction. This would result in an incorrect answer of 162 instead of 262.
3. **Incorrectly handling houses with no restrictions.** The developer may incorrectly handle houses with no restrictions by not limiting the height of the house to the maximum height. For example, in the first example, the developer may incorrectly handle house 1 by not limiting its height to 3. This would result in an incorrect answer of 14 instead of 16.

**Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:**

1. **Carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand all of the constraints.**
2. **Draw a picture of the problem to help you visualize the constraints.**
3. **Write a detailed solution that outlines all of your steps.**
4. **Test your solution on several small test cases before submitting it to the judge.**

CODEFORCES 1218_C. Jumping Transformers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is a list of integers, but the developer may accidentally parse it as a list of strings. This would cause the program to crash when trying to perform arithmetic operations on the data.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may accidentally miscalculate the index of an element in the list, causing the program to skip or overwrite an element. This could lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program, causing it to produce incorrect results. This could be due to a misunderstanding of the problem, or a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm.
4. **Memory leak**. The developer may accidentally create a memory leak, which will cause the program to use up more and more memory until it eventually crashes. This can be caused by failing to free memory that is no longer needed, or by creating objects that are never destroyed.
5. **Race condition**. The developer may accidentally create a race condition, which is a situation where two or more threads of execution can access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even a program crash.
6. **Deadlock**. The developer may accidentally create a deadlock, which is a situation where two or more threads of execution are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely.
7. **Buffer overflow**. The developer may accidentally overflow a buffer, which is a block of memory that is allocated for a specific purpose. This can cause the program to crash or to execute arbitrary code.
8. **Format string vulnerability**. The developer may accidentally use a format string that is vulnerable to a format string attack. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.
9. **SQL injection**. The developer may accidentally include user input in a SQL query. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, which could lead to data theft or system compromise.
10. **Cross-site scripting (XSS)**. The developer may accidentally include user input in a web page without properly escaping it. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, which could be used to steal cookies or other sensitive information.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1240_F. Football

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type.** The input data may be in the wrong format, e.g., a string instead of an integer. This can lead to incorrect results or errors.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over an array or list, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one element or include an extra element. This can lead to incorrect results or errors.
3. **Indexing errors.** When accessing elements of an array or list, it is important to make sure that the index is within the bounds of the array. Otherwise, you may get an error or incorrect results.
4. **Null pointer exceptions.** When a variable is null, you cannot access its properties or methods. This can lead to errors or incorrect results.
5. **Memory leaks.** When you create an object, it uses up memory. If you do not delete the object when you are finished with it, you will have a memory leak. This can eventually lead to your program running out of memory.
6. **Race conditions.** When multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is possible for them to interfere with each other. This can lead to incorrect results or errors.
7. **Deadlocks.** When two threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, they can deadlock. This means that neither thread can continue and your program will freeze.
8. **Security vulnerabilities.** If you are not careful, your program may be vulnerable to security attacks. This could allow attackers to access your data or take control of your computer.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1389_A. LCM Problem

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the LCM algorithm.** The LCM of two numbers can be found by multiplying them and then dividing by their greatest common divisor (GCD). However, if the numbers are not coprime, the GCD may be larger than 1, which will result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Using an incorrect data type to store the LCM.** The LCM of two numbers can be very large, so it is important to use a data type that is large enough to hold the value. If the data type is too small, the LCM will be truncated, which will result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Using a brute-force approach to find the LCM.** The brute-force approach to finding the LCM of two numbers involves iterating through all possible values of x and y until a pair is found that satisfies the constraints. This approach is very inefficient, especially for large values of l and r.
4. **Not handling special cases correctly.** There are a few special cases that need to be handled correctly when computing the LCM. For example, if l = r, then the LCM is simply r. Similarly, if l is a multiple of r, then the LCM is r.
5. **Using incorrect input validation.** It is important to validate the input to ensure that it is valid. For example, the input should be checked to ensure that l is less than r and that both l and r are positive integers.
6. **Not handling errors correctly.** If an error occurs, it is important to handle it gracefully. For example, if the LCM cannot be computed, then an error message should be printed.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. Use a correct implementation of the LCM algorithm. The LCM of two numbers can be found by multiplying them and then dividing by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD can be found using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. Use a large enough data type to store the LCM. The LCM of two numbers can be very large, so it is important to use a data type that is large enough to hold the value. A good choice would be a long integer.
3. Use a more efficient approach to find the LCM. The brute-force approach to finding the LCM of two numbers is very inefficient, especially for large values of l and r. A more efficient approach would be to use the following formula:

```
LCM(x, y) = (x * y) / GCD(x, y)
```

4. Handle special cases correctly. There are a few special cases that need to be handled correctly when computing the LCM. For example, if l = r, then the LCM is simply r. Similarly, if l is a multiple of r, then the LCM is r.
5. Use correct input validation. It is important to validate the input to ensure that it is valid. For example, the input should be checked to ensure that l is less than r and that both l and r are positive integers.
6. Handle errors correctly. If an error occurs, it is important to handle it gracefully. For example, if the LCM cannot be computed, then an error message should be printed.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1430_B. Barrels

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the input variables.**

The input variables `n` and `k` are both integers, so they should be declared as `int`. However, if you accidentally declare them as `long` or `float`, the program will not work correctly.

**2. Using the wrong data type for the intermediate variables.**

The intermediate variables used to store the maximum and minimum values of water in the barrels should be declared as `long`. If you accidentally declare them as `int`, the program will not be able to handle large values of water.

**3. Using the wrong algorithm.**

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. However, if you use a brute-force algorithm, the program will run very slowly.

**4. Not handling special cases correctly.**

The problem statement specifies that the total sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`. If you do not handle this special case correctly, the program will overflow.

**5. Not using efficient data structures.**

The problem can be solved using a heap data structure. However, if you do not use a heap, the program will run very slowly.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain a space between two integers, or a newline character at the end of an integer. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong data type. For example, the expected number of tries k may be a floating-point number instead of an integer. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program may contain logical errors, such as a missing or incorrect condition in an if statement. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The program may miss or add one or more elements to a list or array. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
5. **Infinite loops**. The program may enter an infinite loop, which will prevent it from terminating. This can happen if the program contains a logic error or a bug in the stopping condition of a loop.
6. **Memory leaks**. The program may allocate memory that it does not free, which can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing. This can happen if the program contains a bug in the memory management code.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may contain security vulnerabilities, such as a buffer overflow or a SQL injection vulnerability. This can allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the program or to the data it stores.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully follow the input format of the problem, to use the correct data types, to check for errors in the logic of the program, to avoid off-by-one errors, to avoid infinite loops, to avoid memory leaks, and to protect the program from security vulnerabilities.

2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values may not be correctly specified, which may result in incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a string of characters that are interpreted as numbers, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, which may result in incorrect results. For example, if the program does not correctly check for all possible cases, it may produce incorrect results.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the program does not correctly account for all possible cases. For example, if the program does not correctly check for the case where the input is one less than the expected value, it may produce incorrect results.
5. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when the program does not correctly free up memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more parts of the program try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
7. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more parts of the program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish because they are waiting for the other to finish. This can lead to the program running indefinitely or crashing.
8. **Buffer overflows**. Buffer overflows occur when a program writes data to a buffer that is not large enough to hold the data. This can lead to the program crashing or the execution of arbitrary code.
9. **Format string vulnerabilities**. Format string vulnerabilities occur when a program uses a format string that is not correctly sanitized. This can lead to the program crashing or the execution of arbitrary code.
10. **SQL injection vulnerabilities**. SQL injection vulnerabilities occur when a program uses user input in a SQL query without properly sanitizing it. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information or the execution of arbitrary code.

CODEFORCES 1503_F. Balance the Cards

Pain points:
Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading in the data. For example, if you forget to read in the number of cards, or if you read in the cards in the wrong order, your program will not work correctly.
* **Incorrect data:** The data for this problem is generated randomly, so it is possible that you will encounter some invalid data. For example, you might encounter a card with a negative value on both the front and back, or a card with a value that is greater than the number of bracket types. If you encounter invalid data, your program should either print an error message or exit gracefully.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic for solving this problem is relatively straightforward, but it is easy to make a mistake. For example, you might forget to account for the fact that the front and back numbers of a card can be different signs, or you might not correctly handle the case where the number of cards is odd. If your logic is incorrect, your program will not produce the correct output.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format for this problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when printing the output. For example, you might forget to print the number of cards, or you might print the cards in the wrong order. If your output format is incorrect, the judges will not be able to evaluate your solution correctly.

By following these tips, you can avoid some of the most common problems and bugs that developers encounter when solving this problem.

CODEFORCES 1527_D. MEX Tree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the MEX algorithm**

The MEX algorithm is a simple but tricky algorithm that can be easy to implement incorrectly. One common mistake is to forget to initialize the MEX array to all 0s. This will result in incorrect results, as the MEX of a sequence of all 0s is 0, not 1.

Another common mistake is to iterate over the input sequence in the wrong order. The MEX algorithm should iterate over the input sequence in reverse order, so that the MEX of the first element in the sequence is always 0.

**2. Incorrect handling of duplicate edges**

The input to this problem may contain duplicate edges. If a duplicate edge is present, it is possible to create a path with a MEX of 0 that is shorter than the shortest path from u to v. This can be avoided by checking if the edge (u, v) is already present in the tree before adding it.

**3. Incorrect handling of disconnected graphs**

The input to this problem may contain disconnected graphs. If a graph is disconnected, it is not possible to find a path from u to v for any pair of vertices u and v. This can be avoided by checking if the graph is connected before attempting to find a path from u to v.

**4. Incorrect handling of negative integers**

The input to this problem may contain negative integers. If a negative integer is present, it is possible to create a path with a MEX of 0 that is shorter than the shortest path from u to v. This can be avoided by checking if the input contains any negative integers before attempting to find a path from u to v.

**5. Incorrect handling of large integers**

The input to this problem may contain large integers. If a large integer is present, it is possible to create a path with a MEX of 0 that is shorter than the shortest path from u to v. This can be avoided by checking if the input contains any large integers before attempting to find a path from u to v.

Title:
CODEFORCES 24_C. Sequence of points

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. This can lead to the program crashing or giving incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the midpoint.** The midpoint of two points is calculated by taking the average of their x-coordinates and y-coordinates. However, if the two points have the same x-coordinate or y-coordinate, the midpoint will not be calculated correctly. This can lead to the program crashing or giving incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the reflection point.** The reflection point of a point across a line is calculated by taking the point and reflecting it across the line. However, if the line is vertical or horizontal, the reflection point will not be calculated correctly. This can lead to the program crashing or giving incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not always correctly followed. For example, the output may not be separated by spaces, or the numbers may not be in the correct order. This can lead to the program crashing or giving incorrect results.
5. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the program may not handle negative numbers correctly, or it may not be able to handle large numbers. It is important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it does not contain any bugs.

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem statement is not very detailed, so it is important to read it carefully and make sure that you understand all of the requirements. For example, it is important to note that the first and last blocks of the road are always empty, and that there is always a solution to the problem.
* **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution to this problem is relatively straightforward, but there are a few common mistakes that developers can make. For example, it is important to make sure that you correctly handle the case where the road is empty, and that you correctly account for the fact that the footprints can overlap.
* **Incorrect testing of the solution.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. This can be done by creating a variety of test cases, including cases where the road is empty, cases where the footprints overlap, and cases where the solution is not unique.

Here are some specific examples of problems and bugs that developers may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect understanding of the problem:** A developer might incorrectly assume that the first and last blocks of the road are not empty, or that there is not always a solution to the problem. This could lead to a incorrect implementation of the solution.
* **Incorrect implementation of the solution:** A developer might incorrectly handle the case where the road is empty, or where the footprints overlap. This could lead to a incorrect solution.
* **Incorrect testing of the solution:** A developer might not test their solution thoroughly enough, or they might not test it on a variety of different test cases. This could lead to a solution that is incorrect or incomplete.

By following the tips above, you can help to avoid these common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 345_D. Chain Letter

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly initializing the `visited` array.** The `visited` array should be initialized to all `False` values, but some solutions initialize it to all `True` values. This will cause the algorithm to incorrectly count the number of times the letter is received.
2. **Using an incorrect loop condition.** The loop should iterate over all of the friends, but some solutions iterate over the friends in the wrong order. This will cause the algorithm to incorrectly count the number of times the letter is received.
3. **Incorrectly updating the `visited` array.** The `visited` array should be updated to `True` when a friend is visited, but some solutions do not update the array correctly. This will cause the algorithm to incorrectly count the number of times the letter is received.
4. **Incorrectly calculating the number of times the letter is received.** The number of times the letter is received should be equal to the number of friends who have visited the current friend, but some solutions calculate this incorrectly. This will cause the algorithm to incorrectly count the number of times the letter is received.
5. **Using an incorrect data type for the `visited` array.** The `visited` array should be a Boolean array, but some solutions use a different data type. This will cause the algorithm to incorrectly count the number of times the letter is received.
6. **Using an incorrect loop variable.** The loop variable should be an integer that represents the current friend, but some solutions use a different variable type. This will cause the algorithm to incorrectly count the number of times the letter is received.
7. **Using an incorrect index for the `visited` array.** The index for the `visited` array should be the current friend, but some solutions use a different index. This will cause the algorithm to incorrectly count the number of times the letter is received.

Title:
CODEFORCES 509_D. Restoring Numbers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly specified, so it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the remainder**. When calculating the remainder of a division, it is important to use the correct formula. For example, if you divide 10 by 3, the remainder is 1, not 2.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not strictly specified, but it is important to make sure that the output is readable and easy to understand. For example, if you print the numbers in the wrong order, the output will be difficult to understand.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when you forget to add or subtract one from a number. For example, if you are counting the number of elements in a list, you might forget to add one to the count when you add a new element.
5. **Indexing errors**. Indexing errors occur when you use the wrong index to access an element of an array or list. For example, if you try to access the element at index 10 in an array that only has 9 elements, the program will crash.
6. **Null pointer errors**. Null pointer errors occur when you try to access a variable that has not been initialized. For example, if you try to print the value of a variable that has not been assigned a value, the program will crash.
7. **Type errors**. Type errors occur when you use the wrong type of variable for a particular operation. For example, if you try to add a string to a number, the program will crash.
8. **Logical errors**. Logical errors occur when the program does not behave in the way that you expect it to. For example, if you write a program to calculate the Fibonacci sequence, but the program returns the wrong numbers, there is a logical error in the program.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly.

3. **Incorrect string comparison**. The program may incorrectly compare two strings, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program compares two strings that are not equal, it may return the wrong answer.
4. **Incorrect use of pointers**. Pointers are a powerful tool, but they can also be a source of errors. If a pointer is not used correctly, it can lead to memory corruption or other problems.
5. **Incorrect use of arrays**. Arrays are another powerful tool, but they can also be a source of errors. If an array is not used correctly, it can lead to memory corruption or other problems.
6. **Incorrect use of functions**. Functions are a powerful tool, but they can also be a source of errors. If a function is not used correctly, it can lead to incorrect results or other problems.
7. **Incorrect use of variables**. Variables are a necessary part of any program, but they can also be a source of errors. If a variable is not used correctly, it can lead to incorrect results or other problems.

Title:
CODEFORCES 628_C. Bear and String Distance

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not specified.**

The problem statement does not specify the input format. This could lead to a bug if the developer assumes that the input format is a certain way, but it is actually different. For example, the developer might assume that the input is a string, but it is actually a list of integers.

**2. The output format is not specified.**

Similarly, the problem statement does not specify the output format. This could lead to a bug if the developer assumes that the output format is a certain way, but it is actually different. For example, the developer might assume that the output is a string, but it is actually a list of integers.

**3. The problem statement is ambiguous.**

The problem statement is ambiguous in a few places. For example, it is not clear what is meant by "the distance between two letters". Does it mean the absolute value of the difference between their positions in the alphabet, or the signed value of the difference? It is also not clear what is meant by "any nice string s' that <image>". Does it mean any string that is a permutation of s, or does it mean any string that is a substring of s?

**4. The problem is not well-defined.**

The problem is not well-defined in a few places. For example, it is not clear what happens if the input string is not a nice string. Does the problem still have a solution? It is also not clear what happens if the input string is a palindrome. Does the problem still have a solution?

**5. The problem is too hard.**

The problem is too hard for most developers to solve without using a lot of time and effort. This could lead to frustration and discouragement.

**6. The problem is not interesting.**

The problem is not interesting for most developers. This could lead to boredom and a lack of motivation.

Title:
CODEFORCES 652_D. Nested Segments

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the segment coordinates.** The input specifies that the coordinates of the segments are integers in the range `[-10^9, 10^9]`. If you use a data type that is too small, such as `int`, you may get incorrect results. For example, if you use `int` to store the coordinate `10^9`, the value will be truncated to `2147483647`, which is less than `10^9`.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm to find the number of segments contained in a given segment.** The naive algorithm for finding the number of segments contained in a given segment is to iterate over all of the other segments and check whether they are contained in the given segment. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is too slow for large values of `n`. A more efficient algorithm is to use a binary search to find the smallest segment that is not contained in the given segment. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n).

**3. Not handling the case where two segments overlap.** The problem statement specifies that there are no ends of some segments that coincide. However, it is possible for two segments to overlap. If you do not handle this case correctly, you may get incorrect results.

**4. Not handling the case where a segment contains itself.** The problem statement does not explicitly state that a segment cannot contain itself. However, if a segment contains itself, the number of segments contained in the segment will be infinite. You must handle this case correctly to avoid getting incorrect results.

**5. Not handling the case where the input is invalid.** The problem statement specifies that the input should consist of `n` lines, where each line contains two integers. If the input does not meet this criteria, you must handle it correctly to avoid getting incorrect results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 722_D. Generating Sets

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains a list of integers, so we need to use a data type that can store integers. The most common data types for integers are `int` and `long long`. However, `int` can only store integers up to 2^31 - 1, which is not enough for our problem. So we need to use `long long`.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks us to find a set of distinct integers that generates Y and the maximum element of which is minimum possible. One possible algorithm is to sort the elements of Y in increasing order, and then output the elements of Y in reverse order. This algorithm will work, but it is not optimal.

A better algorithm is to use dynamic programming. We can define a table `dp[i][j]`, where `i` is the index of the element in Y, and `j` is the maximum element of the set we have generated so far. We can initialize `dp[0][0]` to 1. Then, for each element `y` in Y, we can compute `dp[i][j]` as follows:

```
if (j < y):
    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
else:
    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - y]
```

Once we have computed the table `dp`, we can find the minimum maximum element of the set we have generated by finding the smallest value of `j` such that `dp[n - 1][j] == n`.

**3. Not handling corner cases**

The problem statement mentions that the elements of Y are guaranteed to be distinct. However, it is possible that the input contains duplicate elements. If this happens, we need to handle the corner case by simply ignoring the duplicate elements.

**4. Formatting the output incorrectly**

The problem statement asks us to print the output in a specific format. We need to make sure that we format the output correctly.

**5. Using too much memory**

The problem statement does not specify a limit on the amount of memory we can use. However, it is important to be aware of the amount of memory we are using. If we use too much memory, our program may run out of memory and crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 744_B. Hongcow's Game

Pain points:
1. **Not flushing the output after printing an integer.** This is a common mistake that can lead to the Wrong Answer verdict. Make sure to flush the output after printing each integer, or you may not receive a response from Hongcow.
2. **Asking more than 20 questions.** The problem statement clearly states that you may only ask Hongcow at most 20 questions. If you ask more than 20 questions, you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
3. **Including duplicate indices in a question.** When asking Hongcow a question, you must make sure that the indices you provide are distinct. If you include duplicate indices, you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
4. **Using an invalid value for k.** The value of k in your question must be between 1 and n, inclusive. If you use an invalid value for k, you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
5. **Not printing the final answer correctly.** The final answer must be printed on two separate lines. The first line must contain the integer -1, and the second line must contain n integers. The i-th integer on the second line should be the minimum value of the i-th row of the matrix, excluding the i-th element. Make sure to flush the output after printing the final answer, or you may receive the Idleness Limit Exceeded verdict.

Here are some additional tips that may help you avoid these problems:

* Use a debugger to help you track down errors in your code.
* Test your code on small input values before submitting it to the judge.
* Read the problem statement carefully and make sure you understand all of the requirements.
* Ask for help from a friend or mentor if you are stuck.

CODEFORCES 767_D. Cartons of milk

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake. For example, if you forget to put a space between two numbers, the program may not work correctly.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is usually given as a string, but it needs to be converted to the correct data type (integer, float, etc.) before it can be used. If you don't do this, the program may give incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When you are working with indexes, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one or more elements. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Logic errors**. The most common logic error is to forget to check for a special case. For example, if you are writing a program to find the largest element in an array, you need to make sure to check for the case where the array is empty.
5. **Infinite loops**. If you have a loop that never terminates, the program will run forever. This can be caused by a mistake in the loop condition or by a mistake in the code inside the loop.
6. **Memory leaks**. A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but never frees it. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. If you are not careful, your program can be vulnerable to security attacks. For example, if you are accepting input from the user, you need to make sure that the input is properly sanitized to prevent malicious code from being executed.
8. **Performance problems**. Your program may run slowly if it is not written efficiently. There are many ways to improve the performance of your program, such as using caching, parallelization, and data structures that are optimized for the task at hand.

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain two integers, `n` and `m`, separated by a space. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to parse the input and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the first line should contain the string `"YES"` or `"NO"`, followed by a newline character. If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will likely receive a negative score.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the new seating arrangement.** The new seating arrangement must satisfy the following conditions:
    * All numbers from 1 to `n * m` must appear exactly once.
    * Adjacent numbers in the original matrix must not be adjacent in the new seating arrangement.
    If the new seating arrangement does not satisfy these conditions, the program will not be able to solve the problem and will likely receive a negative score.
4. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem, such as:
    * Using incorrect data types
    * Making arithmetic errors
    * Forgetting to initialize variables
    * Using incorrect logic
    By carefully checking your code and debugging any errors that you find, you can minimize the chances of encountering these bugs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 928_A. Login Verification

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data is a string, but the developer may mistakenly use an integer or a float data type to store it. This will lead to incorrect results.

**2. Using incorrect comparison operators**

The problem statement states that two logins are considered similar if we can transform s to t via a sequence of operations of the following types:

* transform lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa;
* change letter «O» (uppercase latin letter) to digit «0» and vice versa;
* change digit «1» (one) to any letter among «l» (lowercase latin «L»), «I» (uppercase latin «i») and vice versa, or change one of these letters to other.

The developer must make sure to use the correct comparison operators to check whether two logins are similar. For example, they must use `==` to check whether two strings are equal, and `!=` to check whether two strings are not equal.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement specifies that the login must not exceed 50 characters in length. The developer must make sure to handle this edge case correctly.

**4. Using incorrect regular expressions**

The problem statement states that the login can contain the following characters:

* lower and uppercase latin letters;
* digits;
* the underscore symbol (`_`).

The developer must use a regular expression that matches all of these characters.

**5. Using incorrect string manipulation functions**

The developer must use the correct string manipulation functions to transform the logins. For example, they must use the `lower()` function to convert a string to lowercase, and the `upper()` function to convert a string to uppercase.

**6. Not using a unit test framework**

The developer should use a unit test framework to test their code. This will help to catch bugs early on and prevent them from causing problems in production.
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect data type**

```
s = "1_wat"
n = 2
logins = ["2_wat", "wat_1"]

if s in logins:
    print("No")
else:
    print("Yes")
```

This code will not work because the `logins` list is a list of strings, but the `s` variable is a string. This means that the `in` operator will compare the `s` variable to each element of the `logins` list as a string, and not as a number. This will result in an incorrect answer.

2. **Incorrect comparison operators**

```
s = "1_wat"
n = 2
logins = ["2_wat", "wat_1"]

if s == logins[0]:
    print("No")
else:
    print("Yes")
```

This code will not work because the `==` operator is used to compare two strings for equality. However, the problem statement states that two logins are considered similar if we can transform s to t via a sequence of operations of the following types:

* transform lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa;
* change letter «O» (uppercase latin letter) to digit «0» and vice versa;
* change digit «1» (one) to any letter among «l» (lowercase latin «L»), «I» (uppercase latin «i») and vice versa, or change one of these letters to other.

This means that two logins that are not equal can still be considered similar. For example, the logins "1_wat" and "2_wat" are not equal, but they are considered similar because they can be transformed into each other by changing the digit "1" to the letter "2".

3. **Not handling edge cases**

```
s = "1_wat"
n = 2
logins = ["2_wat", "wat_1"]

if len(s) > 50:
    print("No")
else:
    print("Yes")
```

This code will not work because it does not handle the edge case where the length of the `s` variable is greater than 50 characters. The problem statement states that the login must not exceed 50 characters in length, so this code will always print "No" regardless of the value of the `s` variable.

4. **Using incorrect regular expressions**

```
s = "1_wat"
n = 2
logins = ["2_wat", "wat_1"]

if re.match("^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{1,50}$", s):
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```

This code will not work because the regular expression is incorrect. The regular expression should match any string that contains only lower and uppercase latin letters, digits, and the underscore symbol (`_`). However, the regular expression in this code also matches strings that contain spaces, which are not allowed in logins.

5. **Using incorrect string manipulation functions**

```
s = "1_wat"
n = 2
logins = ["2_wat", "wat_1"]

if s.lower() in logins:
    print("No")
else:
    print("Yes")
```

This code will not work because the `lower()` function is used to convert a string to lowercase. However, the problem statement states that two logins are considered similar if we can transform s to t via a sequence of operations of the following types:

* transform lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa;
* change letter «O» (uppercase latin letter) to digit «0» and vice versa;
* change digit «1» (one) to any letter among «l» (lowercase latin «L»), «I» (uppercase latin «i») and vice versa, or change one of these letters to other.

This means that two logins that are not equal in lowercase can still be considered similar. For example, the logins "1_wat" and "2_wat" are not equal in lowercase, but they are considered similar because they can be transformed into each other by changing the letter "1" to the letter "2".

6. **Not using a unit test framework**

The following is an example of a unit test for the `is_similar()` function:

```
def test_is_similar():
    assert is_similar("1_wat", "2_wat")
Title:
CODEFORCES 957_C. Three-level Laser

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly parsed by the compiler. This can lead to errors in the program logic.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input variables may not be correctly specified. This can lead to errors in the program logic.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating over an array, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one element or count one element twice. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Index out of bounds errors**. When accessing an element of an array, it is easy to make a mistake and access an element that is outside the bounds of the array. This can lead to a segmentation fault.
5. **Arithmetic errors**. When performing arithmetic operations, it is easy to make a mistake and get an incorrect result. This can lead to incorrect results.
6. **Logical errors**. The program logic may be incorrect, even if the syntax is correct. This can lead to incorrect results.
7. **Off-by-one errors**. When comparing two numbers, it is easy to make a mistake and get the wrong answer. This can lead to incorrect results.
8. **Floating-point errors**. Floating-point numbers are not exact, and rounding errors can lead to incorrect results.
9. **Boundary conditions**. The program may not handle boundary conditions correctly. This can lead to incorrect results.
10. **Memory leaks**. The program may not free memory that it has allocated. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually crash the program.

Title:
CODEFORCES 982_C. Cut 'em all!

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always strictly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may be in a different order. The developer should check the input format carefully and handle any exceptions gracefully.
2. **Incorrect edge representation**. The edges may be represented in a different way than expected. For example, the edges may be represented as lists of vertices, or as tuples of vertices. The developer should be able to handle any edge representation that is given.
3. **Incorrect tree representation**. The input may not actually represent a tree. For example, the input may contain a cycle, or it may not be connected. The developer should check that the input actually represents a tree before attempting to solve the problem.
4. **Incorrect solution**. The developer may come up with a solution that is incorrect. For example, the solution may not find the maximum number of edges that can be removed, or it may not leave all connected components with even size. The developer should carefully test their solution to make sure that it is correct.
5. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always strictly followed. For example, the output may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may be in a different order. The developer should check the output format carefully and make sure that it is correct.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer may incorrectly assume that the input format is always strictly followed. This could lead to errors when the input contains extra spaces, or when the numbers are in a different order.
* The developer may incorrectly assume that the edges are represented as lists of vertices. This could lead to errors when the edges are represented as tuples of vertices, or when the edges are represented in a different way.
* The developer may incorrectly assume that the input actually represents a tree. This could lead to errors when the input contains a cycle, or when it is not connected.
* The developer may incorrectly come up with a solution that is incorrect. This could lead to errors when the solution does not find the maximum number of edges that can be removed, or when it does not leave all connected components with even size.
* The developer may incorrectly format their output. This could lead to errors when the output contains extra spaces, or when the numbers are in a different order.

Title:
HACKEREARTH a-conversion-2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of conversions.** The most common mistake is to count the number of replacements, swaps, and character changes without taking into account the order in which they occur. For example, if you swap two characters and then replace one of them, you have actually performed two conversions, not one.
2. **Not considering all possible combinations of conversions.** When you are trying to find the minimum number of conversions, you need to consider all possible combinations of replacements, swaps, and character changes. For example, if you have two characters that need to be swapped, you could swap them in either order.
3. **Using the wrong data type.** When you are working with strings, it is important to use the correct data type. For example, if you are working with strings that are shorter than eight characters, you should use a character array instead of a string.
4. **Not handling invalid input correctly.** The input for this problem may contain invalid values, such as strings that are longer than eight characters or strings that contain characters that are not in the set {A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J}. You need to handle these invalid values gracefully.
5. **Not using efficient algorithms.** The algorithms that you use to solve this problem should be as efficient as possible. For example, you should use a sorting algorithm to find the minimum number of swaps, and you should use a binary search to find the character that needs to be replaced.
6. **Not testing your code thoroughly.** It is important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly. You should test your code with a variety of input values, including invalid values.

Title:
HACKEREARTH binomial-coefficient-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 = 1. This means that 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When computing the binomial coefficient, it is important to make sure that the upper and lower bounds are correct. For example, the binomial coefficient of n choose k is equal to (n! / (k!(n - k)!)) mod (10^9+7). If the upper bound is k + 1 instead of k, the result will be incorrect.
3. **Using the wrong data type.** When working with large numbers, it is important to use the correct data type. For example, if the input is an integer, the output should also be an integer. Using a floating-point number for the output could lead to rounding errors.
4. **Not using enough precision.** When computing the binomial coefficient, it is important to use enough precision to avoid rounding errors. For example, if the input is n = 10^18 and k = 10^17, the binomial coefficient of n choose k is equal to (10^18! / (10^17!(10^18 - 10^17)!)) mod (10^9+7). If the precision is not enough, the result will be incorrect.
5. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are many different algorithms for computing the binomial coefficient. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. It is important to choose the right algorithm for the problem at hand.
6. **Not handling special cases correctly.** There are a few special cases that need to be handled correctly when computing the binomial coefficient. For example, the binomial coefficient of n choose 0 is equal to 1, and the binomial coefficient of n choose n is equal to 1.
7. **Using a brute-force approach.** The brute-force approach to computing the binomial coefficient is to simply enumerate all possible combinations of k elements from a set of n elements. This approach is very inefficient, and it is only feasible for small values of n and k.
8. **Using a recursive approach.** The recursive approach to computing the binomial coefficient is to recursively compute the binomial coefficient of n choose k and n choose k - 1. This approach is more efficient than the brute-force approach, but it is still not very efficient for large values of n and k.
9. **Using a dynamic programming approach.** The dynamic programming approach to computing the binomial coefficient is to precompute the binomial coefficients of all possible values of n and k. This approach is the most efficient approach for computing the binomial coefficient, and it is feasible for large values of n and k.

HACKEREARTH counting-triangles-4

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correct. For example, the input may contain a letter instead of a number.
2. **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correct. For example, the output may contain a letter instead of a number.
3. **Incorrect calculation:** The calculation of the number of triangles is incorrect. For example, the calculation may not take into account all of the triangles in the level.
4. **Memory error:** The program may run out of memory while calculating the number of triangles.
5. **Timeout:** The program may take too long to calculate the number of triangles.
6. **Incorrect algorithm:** The algorithm used to calculate the number of triangles may be incorrect.
7. **Other bugs:** There may be other bugs in the program that are not listed here.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format, output format, calculation, memory usage, and execution time of the program. It is also important to use a robust algorithm to calculate the number of triangles.

Title:
HACKEREARTH first-6

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the `hack` function.** The `hack` function is designed to lock a chest, not open it. If you use the `hack` function on the manipulated string, it will not open the chest.
2. **Incorrect use of the `s[i] = s[i] ^ (0xf0fffff0 | (0xffffffff & 0x0f00000f));` operator.** This operator is used to XOR the value of `s[i]` with the value of `0xf0fffff0 | (0xffffffff & 0x0f00000f)`. If you use this operator incorrectly, it will not change the value of `s[i]`.
3. **Incorrect use of the `s[i] = s[i] ^ (0xf0ff0ff0 | (0xffffffff & 0x0f00f00f));` operator.** This operator is used to XOR the value of `s[i]` with the value of `0xf0ff0ff0 | (0xffffffff & 0x0f00f00f)`. If you use this operator incorrectly, it will not change the value of `s[i]`.
4. **Incorrect use of the `s[i] = s[i] ^ (0xf0ff00f0 | (0xffffffff & 0x0f00ff0f));` operator.** This operator is used to XOR the value of `s[i]` with the value of `0xf0ff00f0 | (0xffffffff & 0x0f00ff0f)`. If you use this operator incorrectly, it will not change the value of `s[i]`.
5. **Incorrect casting of the character values of the manipulated string to integer values.** When you cast the character values of the manipulated string to integer values, you need to make sure that you are using the correct type of cast. If you use the wrong type of cast, it will not produce the correct output.

To avoid these problems, make sure that you are using the `hack` function correctly, and that you are using the correct operators to XOR the values of `s[i]`. Also, make sure that you are casting the character values of the manipulated string to the correct type of integer values.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The developer may incorrectly define the variable type for the number of times Oz touches the string. This could lead to errors when the program is run.
2. **Incorrect calculation:** The developer may incorrectly calculate the number of 1's and 0's in the magical string. This could lead to incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one error:** The developer may make an off-by-one error when counting the number of 1's and 0's in the magical string. This could lead to incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect logic:** The developer may use incorrect logic to calculate the number of 1's and 0's in the magical string. This could lead to incorrect output.
5. **Uncaught exception:** The developer may not catch an exception that is thrown when the program is run. This could lead to the program crashing.

Title:
HACKEREARTH mental-math

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The developer may incorrectly type the variable type, which could lead to errors. For example, if the developer types `int` instead of `str`, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input.
2. **Incorrect operator:** The developer may incorrectly use an operator, which could lead to errors. For example, if the developer uses `+` instead of `*`, the program will not be able to correctly calculate the largest factor.
3. **Off-by-one error:** The developer may make an off-by-one error, which could lead to errors. For example, if the developer calculates the largest factor of 10 as 9, the program will return an incorrect answer.
4. **Infinite loop:** The developer may create an infinite loop, which will cause the program to run forever. For example, if the developer uses a `while` loop without a terminating condition, the program will continue to run until the user terminates it manually.
5. **Memory leak:** The developer may create a memory leak, which will cause the program to use up more and more memory until it eventually crashes. For example, if the developer creates a new object but does not delete it when it is no longer needed, the program will continue to hold onto the object, which will eventually lead to a memory leak.
6. **Security vulnerability:** The developer may create a security vulnerability, which could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the program. For example, if the developer allows users to input arbitrary data, an attacker could use this data to create a malicious attack.

HACKEREARTH ozos-equations-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The developer may make a mistake in implementing the algorithm, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may forget to check for a negative square root, or they may incorrectly calculate the sum of the digits of a number.
2. **Incorrect input handling.** The developer may not properly handle invalid input, such as a negative number or a number that is too large. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
3. **Insufficient testing.** The developer may not test their program thoroughly, which could lead to bugs that are not caught until the program is deployed in production. This could lead to serious problems, such as data loss or security breaches.
4. **Failure to document the code.** The developer may not document their code properly, which could make it difficult for other developers to understand and maintain. This could lead to bugs that are difficult to fix, or it could prevent other developers from contributing to the project.
5. **Inefficient implementation.** The developer may implement the algorithm in an inefficient way, which could lead to the program running slowly. This could be a problem if the program is used in a high-performance environment.
6. **Security vulnerabilities.** The developer may introduce security vulnerabilities into the program, such as allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data. This could have serious consequences, such as data theft or system compromise.

Title:
HACKEREARTH rasta-and-tavas

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain two integers, n and k. However, a developer may accidentally mistype the input format and only provide one integer. This would cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the sum of primes**. The problem statement specifies that a number is a Tavas if the sum of all primes that divide it is equal to k. However, a developer may accidentally calculate the sum of all integers that divide the number, rather than the sum of all primes. This would result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The problem statement specifies that the output should be a single integer, the number of Tavases. However, a developer may accidentally print multiple integers, or a string instead of an integer. This would cause the program to fail the test cases.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The problem statement specifies that the number of Tavases is the number of integers from 1 to n that are Tavases. However, a developer may accidentally count the number of Tavases from 0 to n-1, or from 1 to n+1. This would result in an incorrect answer.
5. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem, such as using incorrect data types, or making logical errors in the code. It is important to carefully review the code to ensure that it is correct before submitting it.

HACKEREARTH sock-scramble

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the input/output**

The input/output of this problem is a list of integers. If the developer uses the wrong data type, such as a string, the program will not work correctly.

**2. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The most efficient algorithm for this problem is to use a hash table. A hash table is a data structure that stores data in key-value pairs. In this case, the key would be the color of the sock and the value would be the number of socks that color. This allows the developer to quickly find the color of the sock whose pair is missing.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

The developer should be careful to handle edge cases, such as when the number of socks is even or when there are no socks of a particular color.

**4. Using incorrect logic**

The developer should carefully check their logic to make sure that it is correct. A common mistake is to assume that the number of socks of each color is even. This is not always the case, so the developer must be careful to account for this possibility.

**5. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly. The developer should test the code with different input values and make sure that the output is correct.

HACKEREARTH tic-tac-toe-numbers-3

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect logic**. The logic for determining the winner is incorrect. For example, the input `N = 12` should result in `Tac` winning, but the output is `Tic`.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The code may not account for the fact that the Fibonacci numbers start with `0` and `1`. For example, the input `N = 11` should result in `Tac` winning, but the output may be incorrect.
3. **Memory leak**. The code may not properly free up memory after it is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
4. **Stack overflow**. The code may not properly handle large inputs. This can lead to a stack overflow, which can also cause the program to crash.
5. **Incorrect data type**. The code may not be using the correct data type for the input values. This can lead to incorrect results.
6. **Incorrect format**. The code may not be properly formatting the output. This can make it difficult for the user to understand the results.
7. **Security vulnerability**. The code may contain a security vulnerability, which could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.
8. **Incorrect error handling**. The code may not properly handle errors. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
9. **Undocumented code**. The code may not be properly documented. This can make it difficult for other developers to understand and maintain the code.

ATCODER p02560 AtCoder Library Practice Contest - Floor Sum

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for variables.**

The input constraints specify that N, M, A, and B can all be up to 10^9, so we need to use a data type that can store that large of a value. If we use a data type that is too small, we will get an overflow error.

**2. Not handling the edge cases correctly.**

The input constraints specify that N and M must be positive, and that A and B must be less than M. If we don't handle these edge cases correctly, we will get a runtime error or a wrong answer.

**3. Using incorrect formulas.**

The problem asks us to calculate the sum of the floor functions of a series of values. The floor function rounds a number down to the nearest integer. We can use the following formula to calculate the floor function of a value x:

```
floor(x) = x - (x % 1)
```

**4. Not using a fast algorithm.**

The problem can be solved in O(N) time using a simple algorithm. However, we can improve the runtime to O(log N) using a binary search.

**5. Not using a memory-efficient algorithm.**

The problem can be solved in O(1) space using a simple algorithm. However, we can improve the space complexity to O(log N) using a binary search.

Title:
ATCODER p02691 AtCoder Beginner Contest 166 - This Message Will Self-Destruct in 5s

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input type**. The input is a list of integers, but the developer may accidentally parse it as a string. This would result in a ValueError.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of pairs**. The number of pairs is ```N(N-1) / 2```, but the developer may accidentally divide by 2 instead of 1. This would result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the absolute difference of attendee numbers**. The absolute difference of two integers ```a``` and ```b``` is ```abs(a - b)```, but the developer may accidentally calculate ```a - b``` or ```b - a```. This would result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the sum of two integers**. The sum of two integers ```a``` and ```b``` is ```a + b```, but the developer may accidentally calculate ```a - b``` or ```b - a```. This would result in an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect comparison of two integers**. The developer may accidentally compare two integers using the `==` operator instead of the `<=` or `>=` operator. This would result in an incorrect answer.
6. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer, but the developer may accidentally print a list of integers or a string. This would result in a runtime error.

Title:
ATCODER p02820 AtCoder Beginner Contest 149 - Prediction and Restriction

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not correctly parsed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input format is `N K R S P T`, the program may expect the next input to be a string, but it actually receives an integer. This will cause the program to crash.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The data type of the input may be incorrect. For example, if the input is a string, but the program expects it to be an integer, the program will crash.

**3. Off-by-one error**

The program may make an off-by-one error, which means that it misses or repeats one or more elements. For example, if the program is supposed to iterate over a list of 10 elements, but it only iterates over 9 elements, the program will produce incorrect results.

**4. Undefined behavior**

The program may exhibit undefined behavior, which means that its behavior is not specified by the programming language. For example, if the program tries to divide by zero, the behavior is undefined. This may lead to crashes or other unexpected results.

**5. Memory leak**

The program may leak memory, which means that it does not free up memory that it no longer needs. This can lead to a decrease in performance and even crashes.

**6. Race condition**

The program may experience a race condition, which means that two or more parts of the program are trying to access the same resource at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even crashes.

**7. Deadlock**

The program may deadlock, which means that two or more parts of the program are waiting for each other to finish, but neither one can finish because it is waiting for the other. This can lead to a complete halt of the program.

**8. Stack overflow**

The program may stack overflow, which means that it runs out of stack space. This can lead to a crash or other unexpected results.

**9. Buffer overflow**

The program may buffer overflow, which means that it writes data to a buffer that is not large enough. This can lead to a crash or other unexpected results.

**10. Format string vulnerability**

The program may have a format string vulnerability, which means that it can be tricked into executing arbitrary code. This can lead to a complete compromise of the system.

Title:
ATCODER p03092 AtCoder Grand Contest 032 - Rotation Sort

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The most common mistake when solving this problem is to implement the algorithm incorrectly. This can lead to incorrect results or even a runtime error.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the steps of the algorithm. It is also helpful to write out a few examples of the algorithm to make sure that you understand how it works.

**2. Using incorrect data types**

Another common mistake is to use incorrect data types. For example, if the input is a list of integers, you should not try to sort it using a string sorting algorithm. This will result in incorrect results.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to carefully check the data types of the input and output. If you are not sure what data type to use, it is always better to use a more general data type, such as a list or a tuple.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

Many problems have edge cases that need to be handled correctly. For example, the rotation sort problem has an edge case where the input list is already sorted. If you do not handle this edge case correctly, your algorithm will not work correctly.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to carefully consider all of the possible edge cases. You should also write out a few examples of the input and output to make sure that you understand how to handle each edge case.

**4. Not using efficient algorithms**

The rotation sort problem can be solved using a variety of algorithms. However, some algorithms are more efficient than others. For example, the merge sort algorithm is more efficient than the bubble sort algorithm.

To avoid using inefficient algorithms, it is important to research the different algorithms that are available. You should also compare the performance of different algorithms on a variety of inputs.

**5. Not using a programming language that is well-suited for the problem**

The programming language that you use can have a significant impact on the performance of your algorithm. For example, some programming languages are better suited for numerical computations than others.

To avoid this mistake, it is important to choose a programming language that is well-suited for the problem that you are trying to solve. You should also make sure that you are familiar with the language and its features.

Title:
ATCODER p03238 AtCoder Beginner Contest 112 - Programming Education

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always strictly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. The developer should make sure to handle these cases correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not always strictly followed. For example, the output may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be aligned correctly. The developer should make sure to format the output correctly.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The developer may make a mistake when calculating the sum of A and B. For example, they may forget to carry the carry over from one digit to the next. The developer should carefully check their calculations to make sure they are correct.
4. **Incorrect variable usage**. The developer may accidentally use the wrong variable when storing the values of A and B. For example, they may use a variable that is already being used for something else. The developer should make sure to use the correct variables for each value.
5. **Incorrect error handling**. The developer may not handle errors correctly. For example, they may not handle the case where the input is not in the correct format. The developer should make sure to handle all possible errors gracefully.

Title:
ATCODER p03391 AtCoder Regular Contest 094 - Tozan and Gezan

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a sequence of non-negative integers. If we use the wrong data type, such as `int`, to store the input data, we may get incorrect results. For example, if we use `int` to store the input data, the sum of two 10-digit integers may overflow and become negative.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the number of candies given to Takahashi when both Tozan and Gezan perform the operations optimally. A naive algorithm is to iterate over all possible sequences of operations and find the one that gives the maximum number of candies. However, this algorithm has exponential time complexity, which is too slow for large input data.

A more efficient algorithm is to use dynamic programming. We can define a table `dp[i][j]`, where `i` and `j` are the current values of `A` and `B`, respectively. `dp[i][j]` stores the maximum number of candies that can be given to Takahashi when `A` and `B` are equal to `i` and `j`, respectively. We can then fill the table in a bottom-up fashion.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When we are using dynamic programming, it is important to make sure that we are using the correct indices for the table. For example, if we are using a table with dimensions `N + 1` by `N + 1`, we should use `dp[i - 1][j - 1]` to access the value of `dp[i][j]`. Otherwise, we may get incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect boundary conditions**

When we are using dynamic programming, it is important to make sure that we are handling the boundary conditions correctly. For example, if the input data is empty, we should return `0`. Otherwise, we may get incorrect results.

**5. Using floating-point numbers**

The input data is a sequence of non-negative integers. If we use floating-point numbers to store the input data, we may get incorrect results due to rounding errors. For example, if we use `float` to store the input data, the sum of two 10-digit integers may be rounded to a smaller value.

**6. Using uninitialized variables**

When we are using dynamic programming, it is important to make sure that we initialize all of the variables in the table to a safe value. For example, if we do not initialize the variables in the table to `0`, we may get incorrect results.
Test inputs:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

```
N = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))
B = list(map(int, input().split()))

total = sum(A)

        if A[i] > B[i]:

Title:
ATCODER p03554 AtCoder Regular Contest 085 - NRE

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem states that the input consists of two sequences, a and b. However, the solution code only defines a single sequence, a. This will result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** The problem asks to minimize the hamming distance between a and b. The solution code uses a brute-force algorithm to iterate over all possible permutations of a and b, which is inefficient. A more efficient algorithm would be to use dynamic programming.
3. **Incorrect handling of errors.** The problem states that the input consists of integers. However, the solution code does not check if the input is valid. This could result in a runtime error.
4. **Incorrect formatting of the output.** The problem states that the output should be a single integer. However, the solution code prints the output as a string. This will result in an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect indentation.** The solution code is not properly indented, which makes it difficult to read and understand. This could lead to errors in the code.

Title:
ATCODER p03709 AtCoder Grand Contest 015 - Mr.Aoki Incubator

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains a lot of integers, so it's important to use the right data type to store them. In this problem, the input values are all less than 10^9, so we can use `int`.

**2. Not handling overflow**

When computing the sum of a large number of integers, it's possible to overflow the data type. In this problem, we need to compute the sum of the absolute values of the differences between the X coordinates of the Takahashi copies. The largest possible difference is 2 * 10^9, so we need to use a data type that can store values up to at least 2 * 10^9.

**3. Using the wrong algorithm**

The naive algorithm for this problem would be to iterate over all possible ways to transform some of the Takahashi copies into copies of Aoki, and then check if all the copies of Takahashi will eventually become copies of Aoki. This algorithm would have a time complexity of O(2^N), which is too slow for this problem.

A more efficient algorithm is to use dynamic programming. We can define a table `dp[i][j]`, where `i` is the number of Takahashi copies that have been transformed into copies of Aoki, and `j` is the sum of the absolute values of the differences between the X coordinates of the Takahashi copies that have not been transformed into copies of Aoki. We can then fill in the table in a bottom-up fashion, starting with `dp[0][0]`. The final answer will be `dp[N][0]`.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

There are a few edge cases that need to be handled in this problem. For example, if all the Takahashi copies have the same velocity, then they will never collide with each other, so they will never all become copies of Aoki.

**5. Not testing your code**

It's important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it to a contest. This will help you catch any bugs that you may have missed.

ATCODER p03863 AtCoder Beginner Contest 048 - An Ordinary Game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly handling the input format.** The input format for this problem is a string of length 3 or greater, consisting of lowercase English letters. If the input format is not handled correctly, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrectly implementing the game rules.** The game rules for this problem are as follows:
    * Takahashi and Aoki alternately perform the following operation, Takahashi going first:
        * Remove one of the characters in s, excluding both ends. However, a character cannot be removed if removal of the character would result in two neighboring equal characters in s.
    * The player who becomes unable to perform the operation, loses the game.
If the game rules are not implemented correctly, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrectly determining the winner of the game.** The winner of the game is determined by the following rule:
    * If Takahashi is able to remove all of the characters from s, then Takahashi wins.
    * If Aoki is able to remove all of the characters from s, then Aoki wins.
    * If neither Takahashi nor Aoki is able to remove all of the characters from s, then the game is a draw.
If the winner of the game is not determined correctly, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
4. **Other bugs.** There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem, such as:
    * Using incorrect data types
    * Using incorrect variable names
    * Making incorrect assumptions about the input data
    * Making incorrect calculations
    * Not handling errors correctly
    * Not using appropriate error handling techniques
    * Not testing the program thoroughly

By carefully following the problem statement and paying attention to detail, developers can avoid these common problems and bugs.

Title:
AIZU p01031 Smell Searcher

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of the precision R scent detector**

The precision R scent detector can only detect the scent of waste materials in the closed section [max(i-R, 1), min(i+R, N)]. However, some developers may mistakenly try to detect the scent of waste materials outside this range. This will result in incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the scent intensity of the waste material**

The scent intensity of the waste material next to the measured waste material is C less than the original scent intensity, and the scent intensity of the waste material next to the two is reduced by 2 * C from the original scent intensity. However, some developers may mistakenly calculate the scent intensity of the waste material incorrectly. This will also result in incorrect results.

**3. Failure to consider the case where the sum of the scents of the waste materials is less than M**

The goal of the problem is to find the minimum value of R such that the sum of the scents of the waste materials recognized using the detector of accuracy R is M or more. However, some developers may forget to consider the case where the sum of the scents of the waste materials is less than M. This will result in an incorrect answer of -1, even if the correct answer is 0.

**4. Incorrect use of the max() and min() functions**

The max() and min() functions are used to return the maximum and minimum values of a set of numbers. However, some developers may mistakenly use these functions incorrectly. For example, they may try to use the max() function to find the minimum value of a set of numbers, or they may try to use the min() function to find the maximum value of a set of numbers. This will result in incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect use of the for loop**

The for loop is a programming construct that allows you to iterate over a set of values. However, some developers may mistakenly use the for loop incorrectly. For example, they may forget to initialize the loop variable, or they may forget to increment the loop variable. This will result in incorrect results.

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is very specific, and it is easy to make mistakes when reading the input. For example, if you forget to put a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is also very specific, and it is easy to make mistakes when writing the output. For example, if you forget to put a newline character at the end of the output, the program will not be accepted.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic of the program is also very important. If you make a mistake in the logic, the program will not be able to solve the problem correctly. For example, if you forget to check that all of the blocks are connected, the program will not be able to tell if the pattern can form a rectangular solid.
* **Incorrect implementation:** The implementation of the program is also important. If you make a mistake in the implementation, the program will not be able to run correctly. For example, if you use the wrong data type for a variable, the program will not be able to store the correct values.
* **Incorrect testing:** It is important to test your program thoroughly before submitting it. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed. For example, you should test your program with different input values and different block shapes.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid some of the most common problems and bugs that developers may encounter when solving this problem.

Title:
AIZU p01470 Four Arithmetic Operations

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is "$ N$
$o_1$ $Y_1$
$o_2$ $Y_2$
...
$o_N$ $Y_N$". If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly and will produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect operator**

The operators must be one of "+", "-", "×", and "÷". If an incorrect operator is used, the program will not be able to perform the correct operation and will produce incorrect output.

**3. Division by zero**

If the denominator of a division operation is zero, the program will divide by zero and produce an incorrect output.

**4. Integer overflow**

The output of the program must be an integer. If the output is too large or too small, the program will produce incorrect output.

**5. Off-by-one error**

The program must keep track of the current index in the input. If the index is off by one, the program will not be able to perform the correct operations and will produce incorrect output.

**6. Memory leak**

The program must free up memory that is no longer needed. If memory is not freed up properly, the program will eventually run out of memory and crash.

**7. Race condition**

If multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time, the program may produce incorrect output.

**8. Deadlock**

If two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, the program will deadlock and stop responding.

Title:
AIZU p02351 RSQ and RAQ

Pain points:
4 **1. Mismatch between the input format and the expected format.**

The input format is `n q
query1
query2
:
queryq`. However, the developer may accidentally use the format `n q
query1 query2 query3` or `n q query1 query2`. This will cause the program to crash.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the add() and getSum() functions.**

The add() function should add `x` to `as`, `as+1`, ..., `at`. The getSum() function should return the sum of `as`, `as+1`, ..., `at`. The developer may accidentally implement these functions incorrectly, which will cause the program to give incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect use of auxiliary data structures.**

The program may use auxiliary data structures such as arrays or linked lists to store intermediate results. The developer may accidentally use the wrong data structures or use the data structures incorrectly, which will cause the program to give incorrect results or crash.

**4. Off-by-one errors.**

The developer may accidentally use the wrong index when accessing the elements of an array or linked list. This will cause the program to give incorrect results or crash.

**5. Memory leaks.**

The program may allocate memory for temporary variables but not free them when they are no longer needed. This will cause the program to run out of memory and crash.

**6. Race conditions.**

If the program is multi-threaded, the developer must take care to avoid race conditions. A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to give incorrect results or crash.

**7. Deadlocks.**

If the program is multi-threaded, the developer must also take care to avoid deadlocks. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely.
