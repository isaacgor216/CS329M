Pain points:
1. **Incorrect key names**. The input may contain incorrect key names. For example, "C#" may be spelled as "c" or "Cs". The program should be able to handle such cases.
2. **Incorrect input format**. The input may not be in the correct format. For example, it may contain more than 3 characters per line. The program should be able to handle such cases.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output may not be in the correct format. For example, it may not contain the words "Major" or "Minor". The program should be able to handle such cases.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The program may not be able to correctly identify whether a triad is major or minor. For example, it may incorrectly identify a major triad as minor or vice versa. The program should be able to correctly identify all major and minor triads.

CODECHEF icq3

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect comparison:** When comparing two strings, it is important to make sure that the strings are compared in the same order. For example, the string "abc" should be compared to the string "bcd" as "abc" < "bcd". However, if the strings are compared in reverse order, the result will be incorrect.
2. **Off-by-one errors:** When iterating through a string, it is important to make sure that the index is incremented correctly. For example, if the string "abc" is being iterated through, the index should be incremented by 1 after each iteration. If the index is incremented by 2, the result will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect use of functions:** When using functions to sort a string, it is important to make sure that the functions are used correctly. For example, the `sort()` function in Python sorts a list in ascending order. If the list is sorted in descending order, the result will be incorrect.
4. **Memory errors:** When sorting a large string, it is important to make sure that there is enough memory available. If there is not enough memory available, the program will crash.
5. **Timeout errors:** When sorting a very large string, it is possible that the program will time out. This is because the sorting algorithm may take a long time to run.

To avoid these problems, it is important to test your code thoroughly and to make sure that you are using the correct functions and algorithms.

Title:
CODECHEF mriu4

Pain points:
1. **Using the wrong sorting algorithm.** The most common mistake is to use a sorting algorithm that is not designed for sorting in non-decreasing order. For example, quicksort and merge sort are both designed for sorting in non-increasing order, so using them for sorting in non-decreasing order will result in incorrect results.
2. **Using an inefficient sorting algorithm.** There are many different sorting algorithms, and some are more efficient than others. For example, merge sort is a very efficient sorting algorithm, but it is also more complex than some other sorting algorithms. If you are not familiar with the different sorting algorithms, you should choose one that is known to be efficient.
3. **Not handling duplicate elements correctly.** Some sorting algorithms, such as quicksort, do not handle duplicate elements correctly. This can result in incorrect results if the input sequence contains duplicate elements. If you are sorting a sequence that may contain duplicate elements, you should use a sorting algorithm that is designed to handle duplicate elements correctly.
4. **Not handling the case where the input sequence is already sorted.** Some sorting algorithms, such as merge sort, have a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n). This means that if the input sequence is already sorted, the sorting algorithm will still take O(n log n) time to sort it. If you know that the input sequence is already sorted, you should use a sorting algorithm that has a better worst-case time complexity.
5. **Not handling the case where the input sequence is empty.** Some sorting algorithms, such as merge sort, do not handle the case where the input sequence is empty correctly. This can result in an error if you try to sort an empty sequence. If you are sorting an empty sequence, you should use a sorting algorithm that is designed to handle empty sequences correctly.

Title:
CODECHEF righttri

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input format is not specified clearly. For example, it is not clear whether the input should be a list of integers or a list of strings.
* The output format is not specified clearly. For example, it is not clear whether the output should be a list of integers or a list of strings.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input is invalid. For example, if the input contains a negative number, what should the output be?
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the output is not unique. For example, there are multiple right triangles with hypotenuse 5 and area 6. What should the output be?
* The problem statement does not specify how to round the output. For example, should the output be rounded to the nearest integer or to the nearest decimal place?
* The problem statement does not specify how to handle floating-point errors. For example, if the input is 5 and the output is 6, is this considered a correct solution?

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully read the input format and output format, and make sure that the code correctly handles all possible cases. The developer should also make sure that the code is efficient and does not produce any floating-point errors.

Title:
CODECHEF univmt

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modular arithmetic.** The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder of a division. This means that if you have `a % b`, the answer will always be less than `b`. In this problem, we need to find the number of questions thrown across the table, which could be greater than `n`. To handle this, we can use the following formula:

```
(n * (n - 1) / 2) % MOD
```

where `MOD` is the modulo constant.

2. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the number of questions thrown across the table, it's important to remember that the first and last members of the table are not adjacent to each other. This means that we need to subtract 1 from the number of members when calculating the number of questions.

3. **Incorrect use of the `pow` function.** The `pow` function raises a number to a power. In this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose two members from the table, which is `n * (n - 1) / 2`. To do this, we can use the following formula:

```
pow(n, 2) // 2
```

where `n` is the number of members.

4. **Incorrect use of the `mod` function.** The `mod` function returns the remainder of a division. This means that if you have `a % b`, the answer will always be less than `b`. In this problem, we need to find the number of questions thrown across the table, which could be greater than `n`. To handle this, we can use the following formula:

```
(a % b + b) % b
```

where `a` is the number of questions and `b` is the modulo constant.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1019_D. Large Triangle

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not correct. For example, the input may not have two integers n and S, or the integers may not be in the correct range.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not correct. For example, the output may not have three pairs of coordinates (x, y), or the coordinates may not be in the correct range.
3. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm may not be correct. For example, the algorithm may not find a triangle with area S, or the algorithm may find a triangle that does not satisfy the given constraints.
4. **Incorrect implementation.** The implementation of the algorithm may be incorrect. For example, the implementation may have bugs, or the implementation may not be efficient.
5. **Incorrect testing.** The testing of the algorithm may be incorrect. For example, the tests may not test all possible cases, or the tests may not be comprehensive.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to design and implement an efficient algorithm. Finally, it is important to test the algorithm thoroughly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1042_C. Array Product

Pain points:
### Possible Problems

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading it in. For example, you might accidentally read the first line as a number of operations instead of a number of elements in the array. Or, you might forget to include the newline character at the end of each line of input.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format for this problem is also very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when writing it out. For example, you might forget to include the `~` character before the operation type, or you might accidentally write the operation type as a number instead of a character.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic for this problem is fairly straightforward, but it's easy to make a mistake when implementing it. For example, you might forget to check that the array is non-empty before trying to perform an operation on it. Or, you might incorrectly calculate the product of two numbers.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of mistake that can occur when programming. In this problem, you might accidentally index the array one element too low or one element too high. For example, you might try to access the element at index `n` when the array only has `n - 1` elements.
5. **Memory errors.** This problem does not require a lot of memory, but it's still possible to run out of memory if you're not careful. For example, you might accidentally create an array that is too large. Or, you might keep track of too many intermediate values.

### Possible Bugs

1. **Infinite loop.** If you're not careful, your code could enter an infinite loop. This could happen if you have a logic error in your code, or if you're not handling all possible cases.
2. **Stack overflow.** If your code is too recursive, it could cause a stack overflow. This could happen if you're calling a recursive function too many times, or if you're not using tail recursion.
3. **Segmentation fault.** If you're not careful, your code could cause a segmentation fault. This could happen if you try to access memory that you don't have permission to access, or if you try to free memory that's still in use.
4. **Data corruption.** If you're not careful, your code could corrupt data. This could happen if you write to memory that you don't own, or if you read from memory that's been corrupted.
5. **Security vulnerabilities.** If you're not careful, your code could introduce security vulnerabilities. This could happen if you allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on your system, or if you allow attackers to access sensitive data.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1065_B. Vasya and Isolated Vertices

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be two integers n and m, separated by a space. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to process it and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The input integers n and m should be of type int. If they are of a different type, the program will not be able to process them correctly and will likely crash.
3. **Insufficient memory.** The program may run out of memory if the input data is too large. This can be avoided by using a more efficient algorithm or by allocating more memory to the program.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The program may contain logical errors that cause it to produce incorrect results. These errors can be difficult to find and fix, so it is important to test the program thoroughly before deploying it to production.
5. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program may contain security vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system. These vulnerabilities can be avoided by following secure coding practices.
6. **Performance issues.** The program may run slowly if it is not optimized properly. This can be avoided by using a more efficient algorithm or by parallelizing the code.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1086_F. Forest Fires

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulo operation.** When calculating the sum of values modulo 998244353, it is important to make sure that the intermediate results do not overflow. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
def sum_mod(a, b):
  return (a + b) % 998244353
```

This is because the intermediate result of `a + b` may overflow, and the modulo operation will not be correct. To avoid this, we can use the following code instead:

```
def sum_mod(a, b):
  if a < 0:
    a += 998244353
  if b < 0:
    b += 998244353
  return (a + b) % 998244353
```

2. **Incorrect use of 2D arrays.** When using 2D arrays, it is important to make sure that the indices are valid. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
grid = [[0] * 1000 for _ in range(1000)]
grid[-1][0] = 1
```

This is because the index `-1` is out of bounds of the array. To avoid this, we can use the following code instead:

```
grid = [[0] * 1000 for _ in range(1000)]
grid[999][0] = 1
```

3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** When solving a problem, it is important to make sure that you handle all of the edge cases. For example, the following code will not work correctly for the input `n = 0, t = 0`:

```
def solve(n, t):
  if n == 0:
    return 0
  else:
    return t
```

This is because the function will return `0` for the input `n = 0, t = 0`, even though the correct answer is `0`. To avoid this, we can use the following code instead:

```
def solve(n, t):
  if n == 0:
    return 0
  else:
    return t + solve(n - 1, t)
```

4. **Incorrect use of global variables.** When using global variables, it is important to make sure that they are initialized correctly. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
def solve(n, t):
  global grid
  grid = [[0] * 1000 for _ in range(1000)]
  for i in range(n):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    grid[x][y] = 1
  return sum(sum(grid))
```

This is because the global variable `grid` is not initialized before it is used in the function `solve()`. To avoid this, we can use the following code instead:

```
def solve(n, t):
  grid = [[0] * 1000 for _ in range(1000)]
  for i in range(n):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    grid[x][y] = 1
  return sum(sum(grid))

Title:
CODEFORCES 1106_F. Lunar New Year and a Recursive Sequence

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data contains a lot of integers. If we use an incorrect data type to store them, it may cause overflow or underflow. For example, if we use `int` to store `n`, and `n` is very large, then `n` will be truncated to a small value. This will lead to incorrect results.

**2. Using incorrect formula**

The formula for computing `f_n` is `f_n = (∏_{j=1}^k f_{n-j}^{b_j}) mod p`. If we use an incorrect formula, it will also lead to incorrect results. For example, if we forget to use `mod p`, then the results will not be correct.

**3. Using incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm for computing `f_n` is very simple. However, if we use an incorrect algorithm, it may lead to incorrect results. For example, if we use a recursive algorithm, it may cause stack overflow.

**4. Not handling special cases**

The input data may contain special cases. For example, if `k=1`, then `f_n=1` for all `n`. If we do not handle this special case, it will lead to incorrect results.

**5. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code before submitting it. This will help to catch bugs early on.

**6. Using a compiler with incorrect flags**

The compiler flags can affect the output of the code. For example, if we use the `-O2` flag, the compiler may optimize the code in a way that changes the results.

**7. Using a debugger**

A debugger can be used to help find bugs in the code. However, it is important to use the debugger correctly. For example, if we use the debugger to step through the code, we need to make sure that we are stepping through the correct code.

**8. Not using a version control system**

It is important to use a version control system to track changes to the code. This will help to identify bugs and to roll back to previous versions of the code if necessary.

CODEFORCES 1133_F2. Spanning Tree with One Fixed Degree

Pain points:
**1. The input graph may not be a tree.**

If the input graph is not a tree, then there is no spanning tree that satisfies the given condition. For example, if the input graph is a cycle, then any spanning tree will have two vertices with degree 1, and the first vertex cannot have degree D.

**2. The input graph may not be connected.**

If the input graph is not connected, then there is no spanning tree that satisfies the given condition. For example, if the input graph consists of two disconnected components, then any spanning tree will only include vertices from one of the components, and the first vertex cannot have degree D.

**3. The input graph may have multiple edges between the same two vertices.**

If the input graph has multiple edges between the same two vertices, then any spanning tree will only include one of those edges. This means that the degree of the first vertex may not be equal to D. For example, if the input graph has two edges between vertices 1 and 2, then any spanning tree will only include one of those edges, and the degree of vertex 1 will be either 1 or 2.

**4. The input graph may have self-loops.**

If the input graph has self-loops, then any spanning tree will not include those self-loops. This means that the degree of the first vertex may not be equal to D. For example, if the input graph has a self-loop on vertex 1, then any spanning tree will not include that self-loop, and the degree of vertex 1 will be 0.

**5. The input graph may not have enough edges.**

If the input graph does not have enough edges, then there is no spanning tree that satisfies the given condition. For example, if the input graph has n vertices and m edges, where n - 1 < m < (n(n-1))/(2), then there is no spanning tree that includes all of the vertices.

**6. The input graph may have too many edges.**

If the input graph has too many edges, then there may be multiple spanning trees that satisfy the given condition. For example, if the input graph has n vertices and m edges, where m > (n(n-1))/(2), then there may be multiple spanning trees that include all of the vertices.

CODEFORCES 1154_D. Walking Robot

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correctly parsed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of segments**

The maximum number of segments that the robot can pass is not always calculated correctly. For example, if the robot has a battery capacity of 1 and an accumulator capacity of 0, the robot can only pass one segment, even if all of the segments are exposed to sunlight.

**3. Incorrect use of the accumulator**

The accumulator can only be used to store energy, and it cannot be used to power the robot. This means that the robot cannot pass a segment if the accumulator is empty.

**4. Incorrect use of the battery**

The battery can be used to power the robot, but it cannot be used to store energy. This means that the robot cannot pass a segment if the battery is empty.

**5. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

The program must be able to handle edge cases, such as when the robot is at the beginning or end of the path. For example, if the robot is at the beginning of the path, it cannot use the accumulator to pass the first segment.

**6. Incorrect use of variables**

The program must use variables correctly. For example, the variable `i` must be incremented after each iteration of the loop, and the variable `max_segments` must be updated to reflect the maximum number of segments that the robot can pass.

**7. Incorrect logic**

The program must have correct logic. For example, the program must not try to pass a segment if the robot does not have enough energy.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not correctly specified. For example, the input may contain a negative number, a number that is too large, or a number that is not an integer. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not correctly specified. For example, the output may contain a non-integer number, a number that is too large, or a number that is not a multiple of 3. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

CODEFORCES 1297_A. Likes Display

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect rounding of numbers.** The developer may incorrectly round the number of likes to the nearest view, which could result in the wrong answer being displayed. This could be caused by a number of factors, such as using the wrong rounding method or rounding to the wrong number of decimal places.
2. **Incorrect handling of negative numbers.** The problem statement specifies that the number of likes must be non-negative, but the developer may accidentally allow negative numbers to be entered. This could result in the program crashing or displaying an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect handling of large numbers.** The number of likes could potentially be very large, and the developer may need to take special care to ensure that the program can handle these large numbers correctly. This could involve using a data type that is capable of storing large numbers, or using a specialized algorithm for working with large numbers.
4. **Incorrect error handling.** The program should be able to handle errors gracefully, such as when the user enters an invalid input. This could involve displaying an error message, or terminating the program with an appropriate error code.
5. **Inefficient code.** The developer may write inefficient code that could slow down the program or use excessive amounts of memory. This could be caused by a number of factors, such as using inefficient algorithms or data structures, or not using the compiler's optimization options.

**Tips for avoiding these problems:**

1. **Test your code thoroughly.** This is the best way to catch errors in your code before they cause problems for users. Make sure to test your code with a variety of input values, including negative numbers, large numbers, and invalid inputs.
2. **Use the correct data types.** Make sure to use the correct data types to store the number of likes. This will help to prevent errors such as overflow and underflow.
3. **Use specialized algorithms and data structures.** If you are working with large numbers, you may need to use specialized algorithms and data structures to ensure that your program can handle them correctly.
4. **Handle errors gracefully.** Make sure that your program can handle errors gracefully. This will help to ensure that users are not inconvenienced by errors in your program.
5. **Optimize your code.** Make sure that your code is efficient. This will help to improve the performance of your program and reduce the amount of memory it uses.

* The problem statement does not specify what happens if Polycarp drives to an intersection that is not on his path.
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if Polycarp drives to an intersection that is not reachable from his current location.
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if Polycarp drives to an intersection that is not on a shortest path from his current location to his destination.
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if Polycarp drives to an intersection that is on a shortest path from his current location to his destination, but not the shortest path chosen by the navigation system.
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if Polycarp drives to an intersection that is on the shortest path chosen by the navigation system, but not the first intersection on that path.
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if Polycarp drives to an intersection that is the first intersection on the shortest path chosen by the navigation system, but not the intersection where Polycarp started his journey.
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if Polycarp drives to an intersection that is the intersection where Polycarp started his journey, but not the first intersection on the shortest path chosen by the navigation system.

**Possible Solutions:**

* The input format can be made more clear by specifying that the roads are directed and that Polycarp's path is a sequence of intersections that he visits in order.
* The problem statement can be made more clear by specifying that if Polycarp drives to an intersection that is not on his path, then the navigation system does not rebuild the path.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1339_E. Perfect Triples

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the bitwise XOR operation.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The bitwise XOR operation is performed on two integers, and the result is an integer that is equal to the bits that are different in the two input integers. For example, if `a = 0b1010` and `b = 0b0101`, then `a ^ b = 0b1111`.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the lexicographic comparison of two triples.** This is another common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The lexicographic comparison of two triples is performed by comparing the first element of the triples, then the second element, and finally the third element. If any of the elements are equal, then the triple with the smaller fourth element is considered to be lexicographically smaller. For example, the triple `(1, 2, 3)` is lexicographically smaller than the triple `(1, 2, 4)` because the fourth element of the first triple is smaller than the fourth element of the second triple.
3. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm for finding the n-th element of the sequence s.** The algorithm for finding the n-th element of the sequence s is a recursive algorithm that starts with the first element of the sequence and continues to find the next element until the n-th element is found. The algorithm is correct if it is implemented correctly, but it can be difficult to implement correctly.
4. **Incorrect input or output formatting.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results or errors. The input and output for this problem are both formatted as a single line of text. The input line contains a single integer, which is the number of test cases. The output line contains a single integer, which is the n-th element of the sequence s.
5. **Runtime errors.** This problem can be solved in O(n) time, but if the algorithm is not implemented correctly, it can run in O(n^2) time or even worse.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements. It is also important to carefully implement the bitwise XOR operation, the lexicographic comparison of two triples, and the algorithm for finding the n-th element of the sequence s. Finally, it is important to check the input and output formatting carefully to avoid errors.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly followed, which may cause the program to crash or output incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input or output is not correctly specified, which may cause the program to crash or output incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the program may crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program is incorrect, which may cause the program to output incorrect results. For example, if the program does not take into account all of the constraints, it may output incorrect results.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the program does not account for the fact that the first element of an array is at index 0, not index 1. This can cause the program to output incorrect results.
5. **Index out of bounds errors**. Index out of bounds errors occur when the program attempts to access an element of an array that does not exist. This can cause the program to crash or output incorrect results.
6. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when the program does not release memory that it is no longer using. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
7. **Synchronization errors**. Synchronization errors occur when multiple threads attempt to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to crash or output incorrect results.
8. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when the outcome of a program depends on the order in which two or more threads execute. This can cause the program to output incorrect results.
9. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, which prevents any of them from continuing. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely.
10. **Unhandled exceptions**. Unhandled exceptions occur when the program encounters an error that it is not prepared to handle. This can cause the program to crash.

CODEFORCES 1381_B. Unmerge

Pain points:
* [1]. **Incorrect implementation of the merge function.** The merge function should take two arrays as input and return a new array that is the result of merging the two input arrays. The new array should not contain any duplicate elements.
* [2]. **Incorrect use of the merge function.** The merge function should only be used to merge two arrays that have no elements in common. If the two input arrays have any elements in common, the merge function will not produce the correct result.
* [3]. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The merge function should be able to handle edge cases, such as when one of the input arrays is empty or when the two input arrays have the same length.
* [4]. **Incorrect error handling.** The merge function should handle errors gracefully. For example, if one of the input arrays is not a valid array, the merge function should return an error.
* [5]. **Incorrect performance.** The merge function should be as efficient as possible. This means that the function should not use a lot of memory or time to run.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* [1]. **Test your code thoroughly.** Make sure to test your code with a variety of input data, including edge cases. This will help you to identify and fix any errors in your code.
* [2]. **Use the right data structures.** The data structures that you use can have a significant impact on the performance of your code. Choose data structures that are appropriate for the task at hand.
* [3]. **Write efficient code.** There are a number of things that you can do to write efficient code, such as using the right data structures, avoiding unnecessary loops, and using the right algorithms.
* [4]. **Document your code.** Good documentation can help other developers to understand how your code works. This can make it easier to debug and maintain your code.
* [5]. **Use a debugger.** A debugger can help you to identify and fix errors in your code. This can be especially helpful when debugging complex code.

CODEFORCES 1401_C. Mere Array

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the `gcd` function.** The `gcd` function takes two arguments and returns their greatest common divisor. In this problem, we need to find the minimum element of the array and then use the `gcd` function to find the greatest common divisor of that element with each other element in the array.
2. **Incorrect use of the `swap` function.** The `swap` function takes two arguments and swaps their values. In this problem, we need to swap the values of two elements in the array if their greatest common divisor is equal to the minimum element of the array.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating through the array, it is important to make sure that you are not skipping any elements. This is especially important when the array is empty or has only one element.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement specifies that the array must contain at least one element. However, it is possible that the input contains an empty array or an array with only one element. In these cases, the output should be `YES`.
5. **Failure to account for multiple solutions.** The problem statement states that the array can be made non-decreasing using any number of operations. However, it is possible that there are multiple ways to make the array non-decreasing. In these cases, the output should be `YES`.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1424_J. Lonely Numbers

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data is a list of integers. If you use the wrong data type to store the input data, you may get incorrect results. For example, if you use a list of strings to store the input data, you will not be able to compare the strings correctly.

**2. Using incorrect algorithms**

The problem asks us to find the number of lonely numbers in a group of numbers. A lonely number is a number that does not have any friends in the group. A friend of a number is a number that can form a triangle with the given number. To find the number of lonely numbers, we can use the following algorithm:

1. For each number in the group, check if it has any friends.
2. If a number does not have any friends, increment the count of lonely numbers.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all numbers in the group.

This algorithm is correct, but it is not efficient. A more efficient algorithm is to use the following steps:

1. Sort the numbers in the group.
2. For each number in the group, check if it is a lonely number.
3. If a number is a lonely number, increment the count of lonely numbers.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all numbers in the group.

This algorithm is more efficient because it does not need to check if each number has any friends. It only needs to check if each number is a lonely number.

**3. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

The problem states that the input data is a list of integers. However, the input data may contain non-integer values. If you do not check for non-integer values, you may get incorrect results.

**4. Using incorrect mathematical operations**

The problem asks us to find the number of lonely numbers in a group of numbers. To do this, we need to find the number of numbers that do not have any friends. A friend of a number is a number that can form a triangle with the given number. To find the number of numbers that do not have any friends, we can use the following formula:

```
Number of lonely numbers = n - Number of friends
```

where n is the number of numbers in the group.

However, if you use the wrong mathematical operations, you may get incorrect results. For example, if you use the following formula to find the number of lonely numbers:

```
Number of lonely numbers = n / Number of friends
```

you will get incorrect results because the number of friends may be zero.

**5. Using incorrect code formatting**

The code for solving this problem is relatively simple. However, if you do not format the code correctly, it will be difficult to read and understand. This can lead to errors in the code.

**6. Using incorrect comments**

Comments are used to explain the code. If you do not use comments, it will be difficult to understand the code. This can lead to errors in the code.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1446_A. Knapsack

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the solution. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the solution may crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input may not be correct, which may lead to errors in the solution. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, the solution may crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are common in programming, and they can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the solution iterates over the input one element too many or one element too few, the results may be incorrect.
4. **Arithmetic errors**. Arithmetic errors can occur when performing calculations on floating-point numbers. For example, if the solution performs an addition or subtraction on two floating-point numbers that have different precisions, the result may be incorrect.
5. **Logical errors**. Logical errors are errors in the logic of the solution. For example, if the solution does not correctly check for a condition, the results may be incorrect.
6. **Memory errors**. Memory errors can occur when the solution allocates too much or too little memory. For example, if the solution allocates an array that is too small to store all of the input data, the solution may crash.
7. **Timeout errors**. Timeout errors can occur when the solution takes too long to run. For example, if the solution is performing a recursive algorithm on a large dataset, the solution may time out.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can occur when the solution is not properly protected against attacks. For example, if the solution allows users to input arbitrary data, the solution may be vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1470_A. Strange Birthday Party

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data contains a lot of integers. If you use the wrong data type to store them, you may get an overflow error. For example, if you use `int` to store `c_m`, and `c_m` is 10^9, then `c_m` will be truncated to 2147483647, which is not the correct value.

**2. Not handling the corner cases**

The input data may contain some corner cases. For example, the input may contain a negative number, or a number that is too large. If you don't handle these corner cases correctly, your program may crash.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

There are many different algorithms that you can use to solve this problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. If you use an inefficient algorithm, your program may run slowly.

**4. Making a mistake in your implementation**

Even if you use the correct data type, handle the corner cases correctly, and use an efficient algorithm, you can still make a mistake in your implementation. For example, you may forget to add a condition to your code, or you may mistype a variable name. These mistakes can cause your program to give the wrong answer.

**5. Not testing your code**

Before you submit your code, you should test it to make sure that it works correctly. You can test your code by using the sample input and output. You can also test your code by using your own input data. If your code doesn't work correctly, you should debug it until it does.

CODEFORCES 1496_B. Max and Mex

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the \operatorname{mex}(S) and \operatorname{max}(S) functions.** These functions should return the smallest and largest element in the multiset, respectively. However, if the multiset is empty, they should return -1 and 0, respectively.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the ⌈(a+b)/(2)⌉ function.** This function should round up the average of a and b to the nearest integer. However, if a and b are equal, it should return a+1.
3. **Incorrect handling of duplicate elements in the multiset.** When adding an element to the multiset, you should increment the count of that element by 1.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the number of distinct elements in the multiset after k operations.** You should add up the counts of all the elements in the multiset, and then subtract the number of operations that were performed.
5. **Incorrect formatting of the output.** The output should be a single integer, representing the number of distinct elements in the multiset after k operations.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. **Test your code thoroughly.** Make sure to test your code on a variety of input cases, including cases where the multiset is empty, cases where the multiset contains duplicate elements, and cases where k is large.
2. **Use a debugger to help you track down bugs.** A debugger can help you identify the exact line of code that is causing the problem.
3. **Consult with a mentor or other experienced programmer.** If you are stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help. There are many experienced programmers who are willing to help others learn.

Title:
CODEFORCES 174_A. Problem About Equation

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is n, b (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ b ≤ 100), where n is the total number of friends in the group and b is the current volume of drink in the bottle. The second line contains a sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 100), where ai is the current volume of drink in the i-th mug.

If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to parse the input and will produce an error.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The input data is a sequence of integers. If the input data contains any non-integer values, the program will not be able to parse the input and will produce an error.

**3. Division by zero**

The program will divide the total volume of drink in the bottle by the number of mugs. If the number of mugs is zero, the program will divide by zero and produce an error.

**4. Floating-point rounding errors**

The program will print the volumes of drink to add in each mug with 6 digits after the decimal point. However, due to floating-point rounding errors, the sum of the volumes of drink to add may not be exactly equal to the total volume of drink in the bottle.

**5. Off-by-one errors**

The program will iterate through the mugs from 1 to n. However, if n is 1, the program will iterate through the mugs from 1 to 0, which will cause an off-by-one error.

**6. Incorrect output format**

The program is expected to print the volumes of drink to add in each mug with 6 digits after the decimal point. However, if the output format is incorrect, the program will not produce the correct output.
Test inputs:
1. Incorrect input format

```
1 100
1 2 3 4 5
```

This input is incorrect because the number of mugs is 1, but the number of integers in the second line is 5.

2. Incorrect data type

```
1 100
a 2 3 4 5
```

This input is incorrect because the second line contains a non-integer value.

3. Division by zero

```
0 100
```

This input is incorrect because the number of mugs is 0.

4. Floating-point rounding errors

```
5 50
1 2 3 4 5

The program is expected to print the volumes of drink to add in each mug with 6 digits after the decimal point. However, the output of this program does not have 6 digits after the decimal point.
Title:
CODEFORCES 194_B. Square

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain an integer t, which is the number of test cases. The second line should contain t space-separated integers ni, which are the sides of the square for each test sample. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that each test case should be printed on a single line, with the number of crosses John will draw as he will move along the square of the corresponding size. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly produce the output and will produce incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the number of crosses John will draw, it is important to keep track of the number of crosses he has already drawn. It is easy to make an off-by-one error and accidentally count one or more crosses more than once.
4. **Incorrect use of pointers.** When using pointers, it is important to make sure that they are pointing to valid memory locations. If a pointer is pointing to an invalid memory location, the program will crash.
5. **Memory leaks.** When allocating memory, it is important to free the memory when you are finished with it. If you do not free the memory, it will eventually lead to a memory leak.
6. **Synchronization issues.** When multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is important to use synchronization mechanisms to ensure that the data is accessed in a consistent manner. If synchronization is not used, it is possible for one thread to overwrite data that another thread is currently using, which can lead to incorrect results.
7. **Race conditions.** A race condition occurs when two or more threads are trying to access the same data at the same time. If a race condition occurs, it is possible for one thread to get the wrong value for the data, which can lead to incorrect results.
8. **Deadlocks.** A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. If a deadlock occurs, the threads will be stuck in a loop and will never finish.
9. **Unhandled exceptions.** If an exception is thrown and not handled, the program will crash. It is important to handle all exceptions that can be anticipated.
10. **Security vulnerabilities.** It is important to make sure that the program is secure. This includes protecting against buffer overflows, SQL injection attacks, and other security vulnerabilities.

Title:
CODEFORCES 241_F. Race

Pain points:
**1. Mismatch between input and output format**

The input format is described as "three integers m, n and k (3 ≤ m, n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100000)". However, the example input contains only two integers m and n. This will cause the program to crash.

**2. Incorrect assumption about the input data**

The problem statement states that "Consider that all blocks have the coordinates: the j-th in the i-th line have coordinates (i, j) (1 ≤ i ≤ m, 1 ≤ j ≤ n)". However, the example input contains a block with coordinates (2, 3). This will cause the program to crash.

**3. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The algorithm in the solution is incorrect. It does not take into account the fact that the Old Peykan can go from each junction to its adjacent street blocks in one minute. This will cause the program to output incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect handling of errors**

The solution does not handle errors correctly. For example, if the input data is invalid, the program will crash.

**5. Inefficient implementation**

The solution is inefficient. It takes O(mn) time to run, where m and n are the dimensions of the map. This can be improved to O(m + n) time.

**6. Lack of testing**

The solution does not have any tests. This makes it difficult to find bugs.

CODEFORCES 266_E. More Queries to Array...

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading it. For example, you might accidentally miss a comma, or you might put the numbers in the wrong order. This can lead to the program crashing or giving incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect array indexing**. When you're iterating over an array, it's important to make sure that you're using the correct index. For example, if you're trying to access the element at index 5, but the array only has 4 elements, you'll get an error.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When you're doing calculations with arrays, it's easy to make a mistake and add or subtract one too many elements. This can lead to the program giving incorrect results.
4. **Memory errors**. If you're not careful, you can easily run out of memory when you're working with large arrays. This can cause the program to crash or give incorrect results.
5. **Synchronization errors**. If you're working with multiple threads, it's important to make sure that you're properly synchronizing your access to shared data. This can prevent race conditions and other problems.

To avoid these problems, it's important to carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand the input format. You should also test your code thoroughly to make sure that it's working correctly.

CODEFORCES 405_A. Gravity Flip

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain an integer n, and the second line should contain n space-separated integers. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program should be correct in order to correctly calculate the output. For example, the program should correctly account for the fact that the cubes in the first column will move to the last column, and the cubes in the last column will move to the first column.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors can occur when the program is counting or indexing elements. For example, the program might accidentally count the first element twice, or it might accidentally skip the last element.
4. **Memory leaks.** Memory leaks can occur when the program allocates memory but does not free it when it is finished with it. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
5. **Buffer overflows.** Buffer overflows can occur when the program writes data to a buffer that is not large enough to hold it. This can lead to the program crashing or corrupting data.
6. **Security vulnerabilities.** Security vulnerabilities can occur when the program is not properly protected against malicious attacks. For example, the program might allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid common problems and bugs when solving programming problems.

2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format for this problem is also very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if you forget to put a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the output correctly.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic for this problem is not very complicated, but it's still possible to make a mistake. For example, you might forget to account for the fact that two teams with the same color kits cannot play each other at home.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of mistake that can occur when programming. For example, you might accidentally count one team twice when calculating the total number of games played.
5. **Memory leaks.** Memory leaks can occur when a program allocates memory but does not properly free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions.** Race conditions can occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results or crashing.
7. **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can lead to the program being stuck in an infinite loop.

Title:
CODEFORCES 620_F. Xors on Segments

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the XOR operation.** The XOR operation is a binary operation that takes two bits as operands and returns a single bit as output. The output bit is 1 if and only if exactly one of the input bits is 1. In Python, the XOR operation can be performed using the `^` operator.
2. **Incorrect use of the `range()` function.** The `range()` function in Python returns a sequence of numbers from a starting value to an ending value, by an increment. The ending value is not included in the sequence. In the problem statement, the range of the array is given as `1 ≤ x, y ≤ n`. This means that the array elements with indices `x` and `y` should be included in the range. However, if you use the `range()` function with the default increment of 1, the array elements with indices `x` and `y` will not be included in the range. To include the array elements with indices `x` and `y` in the range, you can use the `range()` function with the step argument set to `-1`.
3. **Incorrect use of the `max()` function.** The `max()` function in Python returns the largest element in a sequence. In the problem statement, you are asked to find the maximum value of the function `f(ax, ay)` over all `lj ≤ x, y ≤ rj, ax ≤ ay`. This means that you need to find the largest value of `f(ax, ay)` for all possible values of `ax` and `ay` such that `lj ≤ x, y ≤ rj` and `ax ≤ ay`. To do this, you can use the `max()` function with the `key` argument set to a function that returns the value of `f(ax, ay)` for a given pair of values `ax` and `ay`.
4. **Incorrect use of the `bisect()` function.** The `bisect()` function in Python searches for a value in a sorted sequence and returns the index of the first occurrence of that value. In the problem statement, you are asked to find the index of the first occurrence of the value `ax` in the subarray `a[lj:rj]`. To do this, you can use the `bisect()` function with the `left` argument set to `lj` and the `right` argument set to `rj`.
5. **Incorrect use of the `zip()` function.** The `zip()` function in Python takes two or more iterables and returns an iterator that produces tuples of corresponding elements from the iterables. In the problem statement, you are asked to iterate over the subarray `a[lj:rj]` and the subarray `a[aj:rj]` simultaneously. To do this, you can use the `zip()` function with the two subarrays as arguments.
6. **Incorrect use of the `enumerate()` function.** The `enumerate()` function in Python takes an iterable and returns an iterator that produces tuples of the form `(index, element)` for each element in the iterable. In the problem statement, you are asked to iterate over the subarray `a[lj:rj]` and print the value of `f(ax, ay)` for each pair of values `ax` and `ay` such that `lj ≤ x, y ≤ rj` and `ax ≤ ay`. To do this, you can use the `enumerate()` function with the subarray `a[lj:rj]` as argument.
7. **Incorrect use of the `if` statement.** The `if` statement in Python checks if a condition is true and executes the code block following the `if` statement if the condition is true. In the problem statement, you are asked to print the value of `f(ax, ay)` for each pair of values `ax` and `ay` such that `lj ≤ x, y ≤ rj` and `ax ≤ ay`. To do this, you can use the `if` statement to check if the condition `lj ≤ x, y ≤ rj` and `ax ≤ ay` is true and print the value of `f(ax, ay)` if the condition is true.

CODEFORCES 641_E. Little Artem and Time Machine

Pain points:

 1. **Incorrect implementation of the data structure.** The data structure may not be implemented correctly, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, if the data structure is implemented as a linked list, then it is possible that an element is added to the list at time $t_1$ and then removed at time $t_2 < t_1$. This would result in an incorrect answer to a query at time $t_3 > t_2$, since the element would still be in the list even though it has been removed.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the queries.** The queries may not be implemented correctly, which could also lead to incorrect results. For example, if a query is made to add an element to the data structure at time $t_1$, then the query should not be applied to the data structure at any time $t_2 < t_1$. This is because the element would not be in the data structure at time $t_2$.
3. **Incorrect handling of exceptions.** The data structure may not handle exceptions correctly, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, if a query is made to remove an element from the data structure that does not exist, then the query should not be applied to the data structure. This is because the element does not exist in the data structure, so it cannot be removed.
4. **Incorrect handling of concurrent queries.** The data structure may not handle concurrent queries correctly, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, if two queries are made to add the same element to the data structure at the same time, then the element should only be added once. This is because the two queries are concurrent, so they should not interfere with each other.
5. **Incorrect handling of queries that are made in the wrong order.** The data structure may not handle queries that are made in the wrong order correctly, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, if a query is made to add an element to the data structure at time $t_1$ and then a query is made to remove the same element at time $t_2 < t_1$, then the element should not be removed. This is because the element was added to the data structure before it was removed.
6. **Incorrect handling of queries that are made on elements that do not exist.** The data structure may not handle queries that are made on elements that do not exist correctly, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, if a query is made to count the number of instances of an element that does not exist in the data structure, then the query should return 0. This is because the element does not exist in the data structure, so it cannot have any instances.

CODEFORCES 66_C. Petya and File System

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when writing it. For example, you might forget to include the colon after the disk name, or you might use the wrong characters for the folder names.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is also very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when writing it. For example, you might forget to include the space between the two numbers, or you might use the wrong order for the numbers.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of subfolders.** You need to be careful when calculating the maximum number of subfolders, because it's possible for a folder to have an infinite number of subfolders. For example, if you have a folder called "A", and you create a folder called "B" inside of "A", and then you create a folder called "C" inside of "B", and so on, you could theoretically create an infinite number of folders.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of files.** You need to be careful when calculating the maximum number of files, because it's possible for a folder to have an infinite number of files. For example, if you have a folder called "A", and you create a file called "B" inside of "A", and then you create a file called "C" inside of "B", and so on, you could theoretically create an infinite number of files.
5. **Incorrect handling of duplicate files.** The input data may contain duplicate files. For example, you might have two files called "file1.txt" in the same folder. You need to be careful when handling duplicate files, because you don't want to count them twice.
6. **Incorrect handling of files that are not in folders.** The input data may contain files that are not in folders. For example, you might have a file called "file1.txt" that is directly on the disk. You need to be careful when handling files that are not in folders, because you don't want to count them.
7. **Incorrect handling of folders that are not in the input data.** The input data may not contain all of the folders on the disk. For example, you might have a folder called "C:\temp" that is not in the input data. You need to be careful when handling folders that are not in the input data, because you don't want to count them.
8. **Incorrect handling of folders that are not valid.** The input data may contain folders that are not valid. For example, you might have a folder called "C:\temp\file1.txt". This is not a valid folder, because it contains a file instead of another folder. You need to be careful when handling folders that are not valid, because you don't want to count them.

**How to avoid these problems:**

1. **Be careful when writing the input format.** Make sure to include all of the required characters, and make sure to use the correct characters for the folder names.
2. **Be careful when writing the output format.** Make sure to include the space between the two numbers, and make sure to use the correct order for the numbers.
3. **Be careful when calculating the maximum number of subfolders.** Remember that it's possible for a folder to have an infinite number of subfolders.
4. **Be careful when calculating the maximum number of files.** Remember that it's possible for a folder to have an infinite number of files.
5. **Be careful when handling duplicate files.** Make sure to only count each file once.
6. **Be careful when handling files that are not in folders.** Don't count files that are not in folders.
7. **Be careful when handling folders that are not in the input data.** Don't count folders that are not in the input data.
8. **Be careful when handling folders that are not valid.** Don't count folders that are not valid.
Test inputs:
```
input1: C:\folder1\file1.txt

Title:
CODEFORCES 690_F3. Tree of Life (hard)

Pain points:
NO **1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is `n k`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree and `k` is the number of drawings. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The data type of the input values must be correct. For example, the number of nodes `n` must be an integer, and the edge weights must be floating-point numbers. If the data type is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly process the input and will likely crash.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that can occur when programming. This type of error occurs when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one, which can lead to incorrect results.

**4. Logical errors**

Logical errors are a type of bug that occurs when a programmer makes a mistake in their logic. This type of error can be difficult to find, as it may not cause the program to crash. However, logical errors can still lead to incorrect results.

**5. Insufficient testing**

Insufficient testing is a common cause of bugs. When a program is not tested thoroughly, it is more likely to contain bugs. This is because the programmer may not have found all of the possible ways to use the program, and therefore may not have found all of the possible bugs.

**6. Using outdated libraries**

Using outdated libraries can also lead to bugs. This is because outdated libraries may contain bugs that have not been fixed. When a program uses an outdated library, it is more likely to contain bugs.

**7. Using insecure code**

Using insecure code can also lead to bugs. This is because insecure code can be exploited by attackers to gain access to the program or its data. When a program uses insecure code, it is more likely to be vulnerable to attacks.

**8. Ignoring compiler warnings**

Ignoring compiler warnings can also lead to bugs. This is because compiler warnings are there to warn the programmer about potential problems in their code. When a programmer ignores a compiler warning, they are essentially ignoring the warning that the code may contain a bug.

**9. Not using a debugger**

Not using a debugger can also lead to bugs. A debugger can help the programmer to find and fix bugs by allowing them to step through the code line by line and see how the variables change. When a programmer does not use a debugger, they are more likely to miss bugs.

**10. Not using version control**

Not using version control can also lead to bugs. Version control allows the programmer to keep track of changes to the code, which can help them to identify and fix bugs. When a programmer does not use version control, they are more likely to lose track of changes to the code, which can make it more difficult to identify and fix bugs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 715_E. Complete the Permutations

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not very clear. It is not clear whether the input should be a list of integers or a list of strings. This can lead to errors in the code if the developer does not correctly parse the input.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the distance between two permutations**

The distance between two permutations is the minimum number of moves required to turn one permutation into the other. A move consists of swapping exactly two elements of the permutation. This can be a tricky calculation, and it is important to make sure that the code is correct.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the number of ways to replace the zeros**

The number of ways to replace the zeros with positive integers from the set {1, 2, ..., n} such that p and q are permutations of {1, 2, ..., n} and the distance between p and q is exactly k is given by the following formula:

```
C(n - k, k)
```

where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient. This formula can be used to calculate the number of ways to replace the zeros, but it is important to make sure that the code is correct.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output of the problem should be a list of integers, where the i-th integer denotes the answer for k = i - 1. It is important to make sure that the output is in the correct format, and that the integers are correctly modulo 998244353.

**5. Other errors**

There are a number of other errors that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include errors in memory management, errors in thread synchronization, and errors in exception handling. It is important to be aware of these potential errors and to take steps to avoid them.

Title:
CODEFORCES 736_B. Taxes

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is specified as follows:

```
The first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the total year income of mr. Funt.
```

However, a developer may incorrectly parse the input and expect a different format, such as:

```
n
```

This would result in a `ValueError` being raised.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is specified as follows:

```
Print one integer — minimum possible number of burles that mr. Funt has to pay as a tax.
```

However, a developer may incorrectly format the output and print multiple integers, or a string instead of an integer. This would result in a `TypeError` being raised.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The developer may incorrectly implement the logic for finding the minimum number of burles that mr. Funt has to pay. This could result in an incorrect answer being returned.

**4. Insufficient testing**

The developer may not test their code sufficiently, which could result in bugs being missed. This could lead to incorrect results being returned, or the code crashing.

**5. Using global variables**

The developer may use global variables in their code, which can lead to problems if multiple functions or threads are accessing the same variable. This could result in incorrect results being returned, or the code crashing.

**6. Not using exception handling**

The developer may not use exception handling in their code, which can lead to problems if an error occurs. This could result in the code crashing, or the wrong results being returned.

**7. Not using comments**

The developer may not use comments in their code, which can make it difficult for other developers to understand what the code is doing. This could lead to bugs being introduced, or the code being difficult to maintain.

**8. Not following coding standards**

The developer may not follow coding standards, which can make it difficult for other developers to read and understand their code. This could lead to bugs being introduced, or the code being difficult to maintain.

**9. Using outdated libraries**

The developer may be using outdated libraries, which can lead to security vulnerabilities or bugs. This could result in the code being compromised, or the wrong results being returned.

**10. Not using version control**

The developer may not be using version control, which can make it difficult to track changes to the code. This could lead to problems if a bug is introduced, or if the code needs to be rolled back.

Title:
CODEFORCES 780_F. Axel and Marston in Bitland

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may contain incorrect data types, such as strings instead of integers. This can lead to errors in the program's logic and incorrect results.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating over a list or array, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one element or include an extra element. This can lead to incorrect results or even a program crash.
3. **Array out-of-bounds errors**. When accessing an element of an array, it is important to make sure that the index is within the bounds of the array. Otherwise, the program will crash.
4. **Null pointer errors**. When a pointer is assigned to a null value, it can cause the program to crash. This can happen when a pointer is dereferenced or when a function is called with a null pointer argument.
5. **Memory leaks**. When a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed, it can lead to a memory leak. This can eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
6. **Race conditions**. When two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time, it can lead to a race condition. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or even crash.
7. **Deadlocks**. When two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, it can lead to a deadlock. This can cause the program to be stuck and unable to continue execution.
8. **Buffer overflows**. When a program writes data to a buffer that is not large enough, it can overwrite adjacent memory locations. This can lead to security vulnerabilities or even a program crash.
9. **Format string vulnerabilities**. When a program uses a format string without properly escaping the user input, it can lead to a format string vulnerability. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.
10. **SQL injection attacks**. When a program uses user input in an SQL query without properly sanitizing it, it can lead to a SQL injection attack. This can allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the database.

Title:
CODEFORCES 899_E. Segments Removal

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is specified in the problem statement. Make sure that you are reading the input correctly. For example, if the problem statement says that the input should be a single integer, but you read it as a string, you will get an incorrect answer.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also specified in the problem statement. Make sure that you are writing the output correctly. For example, if the problem statement says that the output should be a single integer, but you write a string, you will get an incorrect answer.

**3. Undefined behavior**

Some programming languages have undefined behavior, which means that the compiler is not required to produce a correct output if you use certain constructs. For example, in C++, if you divide an integer by zero, the compiler is allowed to do anything it wants, including crashing your program. If you are not familiar with undefined behavior, you should read up on it before you start writing your solution.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when you forget to increment or decrement a variable by one. For example, if you are iterating over a list of elements, and you forget to increment the index variable by one, you will skip the last element in the list.

**5. Using the wrong data type**

Make sure that you are using the correct data type for the values in your program. For example, if you are storing the number of elements in a list, you should use an integer, not a floating-point number.

**6. Using the wrong algorithm**

There are many different algorithms that you can use to solve a problem. Make sure that you are using the right algorithm for the problem you are trying to solve. For example, if you are trying to find the longest common substring in two strings, you should use the KMP algorithm, not the brute-force algorithm.

**7. Not handling all cases**

Make sure that your solution handles all possible cases. For example, if the problem statement says that the input can be empty, your solution should handle the case where the input is empty.

**8. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before you submit it. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed. There are many different ways to test your code. You can use a unit testing framework, or you can manually test your code.

Title:
CODEFORCES 996_B. World Cup

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is `n a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. This means that the first line should contain a single integer `n` and the second line should contain `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly output the answer and will produce incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic for this problem is relatively simple. Allen starts at the end of the queue at the first entrance. Each minute, he checks if he is the first in the queue. If he is not the first in the queue, he leaves the current queue and stands in the end of the queue at the next entrance (or the first entrance if he leaves the last entrance). Once Allen is the first in the queue, he enters the fan zone. If the logic for this problem is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly determine the entrance through which Allen will finally enter the fan zone and will produce incorrect output.

**4. Runtime errors**

The program should be able to run within the time limit of 1 second. If the program takes longer than 1 second to run, it will be considered a runtime error and will receive a score of 0.

**5. Memory errors**

The program should not use more than 256 MB of memory. If the program uses more than 256 MB of memory, it will be considered a memory error and will receive a score of 0.

**6. Other errors**

There are a number of other possible errors that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These errors include:

* Syntax errors
* Semantic errors
* Logical errors
* Runtime errors
* Memory errors
* Other errors

It is important to be aware of these possible errors and to take steps to avoid them when writing code.

Title:
HACKEREARTH help-golu

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong algorithm**

The most common mistake is to use the wrong algorithm to solve the problem. For example, you might try to use a brute-force approach that checks every possible combination of prime numbers, which would be very inefficient.

**2. Not handling edge cases**

Another common mistake is to not handle edge cases. For example, if the input is negative, you should return an error.

**3. Using incorrect data types**

You should make sure to use the correct data types for your variables. For example, if you are storing the number of prime numbers, you should use an integer, not a floating-point number.

**4. Making a logic error**

Finally, you should make sure that your logic is correct. For example, you should make sure that you are adding the prime numbers correctly.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* **Read the problem carefully and understand the output format.** This will help you avoid making mistakes in your algorithm.
* **Test your code on a few small examples before submitting it.** This will help you catch any errors in your code.
* **Use a debugger to help you track down errors.** This can be especially helpful if you are not sure where the error is occurring.
* **Ask for help if you are stuck.** There are many online resources available to help you solve programming problems.

Title:
HACKEREARTH lucky-string-jackpot-1

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format specifies that the first line should contain the number of test cases T. However, if the input format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the input format is "4\n1 2 3 4", the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format specifies that the output should be a single integer. However, if the output format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the output format is "1 2 3 4", the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the largest palindrome**

The largest palindrome is a string that is the same backwards and forwards. For example, "121" is a palindrome, but "123" is not. To find the largest palindrome in a string, we can use a brute-force approach and check every possible substring of the string. However, this approach is very inefficient and can take a long time to run. A more efficient approach is to use a dynamic programming algorithm.

**4. Memory leaks**

The program may leak memory if it does not properly free the memory that it allocates. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash. To avoid memory leaks, the program should use the `delete` keyword to free any memory that it allocates.

**5. Race conditions**

A race condition occurs when two threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash. To avoid race conditions, the program should use locks to protect shared data.

**6. Deadlocks**

A deadlock occurs when two threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can cause the program to run indefinitely or crash. To avoid deadlocks, the program should use locks in a consistent order.

**7. Incorrect use of exceptions**

Exceptions can be used to handle errors in the program. However, if exceptions are used incorrectly, the program may crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if an exception is thrown in a function that does not declare an exception, the program may crash.

**8. Incorrect use of asserts**

Asserts can be used to check for errors in the program. However, if asserts are used incorrectly, the program may crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if an assert is used to check for a condition that is always true, the program may crash.

**9. Incorrect use of comments**

Comments can be used to document the code and make it easier to understand. However, if comments are used incorrectly, the program may be difficult to understand or maintain. For example, if a comment is used to explain a code that is not correct, the program may be difficult to understand or maintain.

**10. Incorrect use of whitespace**

Whitespace can be used to make the code more readable. However, if whitespace is used incorrectly, the program may be difficult to read or maintain. For example, if a line of code is too long, it may be difficult to read.

Title:
HACKEREARTH product-of-and-gate

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The problem states that A and B are integers, so you should make sure to use the correct data types when storing them. For example, if you use `int` for both A and B, you may get incorrect results if either of them is a negative number.

**2. Using incorrect operators**

The problem asks you to find the bitwise AND of A and B, so you should use the bitwise AND operator (`&`). If you use the regular AND operator (`&&`), you will get incorrect results.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The bitwise AND operator works by performing a logical AND on each bit of the two operands. This means that if any bit in either operand is 0, the result will be 0. So, if you have two numbers that are not equal, the bitwise AND of them will always be 0.

**4. Not handling overflow correctly**

When you perform a bitwise AND operation on two numbers, the result can be larger than either of the operands. This is because the bitwise AND operator does not perform any overflow checking. If you do not handle overflow correctly, you may get incorrect results.

**5. Not handling negative numbers correctly**

The bitwise AND operator does not work correctly on negative numbers. If you try to use the bitwise AND operator on two negative numbers, you will get incorrect results.

**6. Using incorrect code**

There are many ways to solve this problem. However, not all solutions are correct. Make sure to carefully read the problem statement and come up with a solution that is both correct and efficient.

Title:
HACKEREARTH the-castle-gate-july-easy

Pain points:
1. The most important problem that a developer may encounter when solving this problem is understanding the problem statement. The problem statement is not very clear and it is easy to make mistakes when interpreting it.
2. Another common problem is not being able to come up with an efficient solution. The naive solution to this problem would be to iterate over all possible pairs of integers from 1 to N and check if their bit-wise XOR does not exceed N. This would take O(N^2) time, which is not efficient enough.
3. A more efficient solution is to use the following formula:

```
T = (N * (N + 1)) / 2
```

This formula gives the number of unordered pairs of distinct integers from 1 to N.
4. Finally, a developer may also make mistakes when implementing the solution. It is important to be careful when writing code, especially when dealing with bit-wise operations.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. Read the problem statement carefully and make sure you understand it before starting to work on a solution.
2. If you are not sure how to solve the problem, try to break it down into smaller subproblems. This can often make it easier to come up with a solution.
3. Use a debugger to help you track down bugs in your code.
4. Test your code thoroughly before submitting it.

Title:
HACKEREARTH xenny-and-k-equal-triplets

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is given as integers, but the problem requires us to find the probability in terms of a fraction. So we need to make sure that we are using the correct data type to store the probability.

**2. Not handling the edge cases**

The problem states that `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6` and `1 ≤ K ≤ 10^9`. So we need to make sure that our code handles these edge cases correctly.

**3. Using incorrect formulas**

The problem asks us to find the probability of getting a K-equal triplet. The formula for this is:

```
P(K-equal-triplet) = (3C1 * (N-3)! / N!) / (K! * (N-K)!)
```

We need to make sure that we are using the correct formula in our code.

**4. Overflow errors**

The problem states that `N ≤ 10^6` and `K ≤ 10^9`. So we need to make sure that our code does not overflow when calculating the probability.

ATCODER p02648 Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Programming Contest 2020 - Knapsack Queries on a tree

Pain points:
252
251
 **1. Incorrect implementation of the knapsack algorithm**

The knapsack algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that can be used to find the maximum value of a set of items subject to a weight constraint. In this problem, the items are the vertices of the tree and the weight of an item is the sum of the weights of its descendants. The knapsack algorithm works by recursively subdividing the tree into smaller and smaller subproblems until each subproblem contains a single vertex. The value of each subproblem is then calculated by adding the value of the vertex to the maximum value of the subproblems that are its descendants.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing the knapsack algorithm is to incorrectly calculate the value of a subproblem. For example, a developer might mistakenly add the value of the vertex to the maximum value of the subproblems that are its ancestors instead of its descendants. This would result in an incorrect answer.

**2. Incorrect handling of duplicate vertices**

Another common mistake that developers make when implementing the knapsack algorithm is to incorrectly handle duplicate vertices. A duplicate vertex is a vertex that appears more than once in the tree. When a developer encounters a duplicate vertex, they must decide whether to include it in the knapsack or not. If the developer includes the duplicate vertex, they must add its value to the knapsack. If the developer does not include the duplicate vertex, they must not add its value to the knapsack.

**3. Incorrect handling of the weight constraint**

The weight constraint in the knapsack problem specifies the maximum weight that the knapsack can hold. When a developer implements the knapsack algorithm, they must make sure to check that the weight of the items in the knapsack does not exceed the weight constraint. If the weight of the items in the knapsack exceeds the weight constraint, the developer must return an empty knapsack.

**4. Incorrect handling of the input data**

The input data for the knapsack problem can be incorrect in a number of ways. For example, the input data might contain negative weights or values. The developer must make sure to check the input data for errors and to handle them appropriately.

**5. Incorrect output format**

The output for the knapsack problem must be in a specific format. The developer must make sure that their output is in the correct format.

**6. Incorrect time complexity**

The knapsack algorithm has a time complexity of O(nW), where n is the number of vertices in the tree and W is the maximum weight of an item. The developer must make sure that their implementation of the knapsack algorithm has the correct time complexity.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input is given in the format of `S T
A B
U`, where `S`, `T`, `A`, `B`, and `U` are strings. However, if the developer mistakenly defines them as integers, the program will not work correctly.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator**. The problem statement states that `S \not= T`, which means that `S` and `T` are not equal. However, if the developer mistakenly uses the `==` operator, the program will incorrectly output that `S` and `T` are equal.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The problem statement states that Takahashi chooses one ball with the string `U` written on it and throws it away. This means that the number of balls with the string `S` will decrease by 1 if `S` is equal to `U`, and the number of balls with the string `T` will decrease by 1 if `T` is equal to `U`. However, if the developer does not account for this, the program will incorrectly output the number of balls with the string `S` and `T` that we have now.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The problem statement states that the output should be printed in the format of `A B`, with a space in between. However, if the developer does not format the output correctly, the program will not produce the correct output.
5. **Other errors**. There are a number of other errors that a developer may encounter when solving this problem, such as incorrect variable initialization, incorrect array indexing, and incorrect use of functions. It is important to be careful to avoid these errors in order to ensure that the program runs correctly.

ATCODER p02912 AtCoder Beginner Contest 141 - Powerful Discount Tickets

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm.** The greedy algorithm for this problem works by iteratively applying the discount tickets to the most expensive item until the item is free. However, if the item is not free after applying all of the discount tickets, the algorithm will incorrectly return the price of the item.
2. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The input format for this problem specifies that `N` and `M` must be integers between 1 and 10^5. However, if either of these values is outside of this range, the algorithm will crash.
3. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.** The problem states that the prices of the items are integers. However, if the prices are represented as floating-point numbers, the algorithm may produce incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect use of the `round()` function.** The `round()` function rounds a floating-point number to the nearest integer. However, if the number is halfway between two integers, the `round()` function may round it to the wrong integer.
5. **Incorrect use of the `min()` function.** The `min()` function returns the smallest of two or more values. However, if the values are equal, the `min()` function may return the wrong value.
6. **Incorrect use of the `max()` function.** The `max()` function returns the largest of two or more values. However, if the values are equal, the `max()` function may return the wrong value.

Title:
ATCODER p03048 diverta 2019 Programming Contest - RGB Boxes

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains four integers, so it is tempting to use `int` to store them. However, `int` has a maximum value of 2147483647, which is not enough to store the values in the input. To avoid this problem, we can use `long long`.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The naive algorithm for this problem is to enumerate all possible combinations of r, g, and b that sum to N. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(N^3), which is too slow for large values of N. A more efficient algorithm is to use dynamic programming.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When using dynamic programming, it is important to be careful about off-by-one errors. For example, when computing the value of `dp[i][j][k]`, we need to make sure that `i`, `j`, and `k` are all non-negative.

**4. Incorrect boundary conditions**

When using dynamic programming, it is important to make sure that the boundary conditions are correct. For example, the value of `dp[0][0][0]` should be 1, because there is one way to get 0 balls by buying no red, green, or blue boxes.

**5. Memory leaks**

When using dynamic programming, it is important to free the memory that is allocated for the DP table. If the memory is not freed, it can lead to a memory leak.

Title:
ATCODER p03497 AtCoder Regular Contest 086 - Not so Diverse

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input specifies that `1 <= N <= 200000`, so the developer should use a data type that can store integers up to this value. Using a smaller data type, such as `int`, could result in overflow errors.

**2. Not handling the case where `K > N`**

The problem states that `1 <= K <= N`, so the developer should check for this condition before proceeding. If `K > N`, the answer is simply `0`.

**3. Not considering the case where all of the integers are the same**

The problem states that Takahashi wants to rewrite the integers on some balls so that there are at most K different integers written on the N balls. If all of the integers are the same, then Takahashi doesn't need to rewrite any of them.

**4. Using an inefficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved in O(N) time using a simple greedy algorithm. A more efficient solution is possible using a sorting algorithm, but this is not necessary for the given constraints.

**5. Not handling corner cases**

The developer should always check for corner cases, such as empty input or invalid input. In this problem, the input could be empty, or it could contain invalid integers. The developer should handle these cases gracefully.

Title:
ATCODER p03657 AtCoder Beginner Contest 067 - Sharing Cookies

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input is given in the format `A B`, where `A` and `B` are integers. If you accidentally use the wrong data type, such as a string, you will get a `TypeError`.

**2. Not checking for overflow**

When adding `A` and `B`, you need to check for overflow. If the sum of `A` and `B` is greater than `100`, you will get a `ValueError`.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The correct algorithm for this problem is to check if `A % 3 == 0` and `B % 3 == 0`. If both of these conditions are true, then it is possible to give cookies to the three goats so that each of them has the same number of cookies. Otherwise, it is not possible.

**4. Not handling the edge cases**

There are two edge cases to consider for this problem. The first is the case where `A == 0` or `B == 0`. In this case, it is not possible to give cookies to the three goats so that each of them has the same number of cookies. The second edge case is the case where `A + B == 0`. In this case, it is also not possible to give cookies to the three goats so that each of them has the same number of cookies.

Title:
ATCODER p03813 AtCoder Beginner Contest 053 - ABC/ARC

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect comparison operator**. The problem states that Smeke will participate in ABC if his current rating is less than 1200, so the comparison operator should be `<`. However, a developer might accidentally use the `==` operator, which would result in the incorrect answer being printed.
2. **Incorrect type casting**. The problem states that the input is an integer, so the developer should cast the input to an integer before comparing it to 1200. However, a developer might accidentally cast the input to a string, which would result in a type error.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The problem states that Smeke will participate in ABC if his current rating is less than 1200, so the developer should print `ABC` if the input is less than 1200. However, a developer might accidentally print `ABC` if the input is equal to 1200, which would be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect indentation**. The problem statement is indented four spaces, so the developer's code should also be indented four spaces. However, a developer might accidentally forget to indent their code, which would result in a syntax error.
5. **Missing semicolon**. The end of each statement in the problem statement is followed by a semicolon, so the developer's code should also end with a semicolon. However, a developer might accidentally forget to add a semicolon, which would result in a syntax error.
6. **Incorrect variable name**. The problem statement uses the variable name `x` to represent Smeke's current rating. A developer might accidentally use a different variable name, which would result in the code not working correctly.
7. **Incorrect function call**. The problem statement uses the `print()` function to print the answer. A developer might accidentally use a different function, which would result in the code not working correctly.
8. **Incorrect error handling**. The problem statement does not specify what should happen if the input is invalid. A developer should include error handling code to handle this case.
9. **Incorrect test cases**. The developer should include test cases to verify that their code is working correctly.
10. **Incorrect documentation**. The developer should include documentation to explain how to use their code.

Title:
ATCODER p03982 Kyoto University Programming Contest 2016 - WAAAAAAAAAAAAALL

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces or new lines. The developer should check the input format carefully and handle incorrect input formats appropriately.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The input data may not be in the correct data type. For example, the input may contain a string instead of an integer. The developer should check the data type of the input data and convert it to the correct data type if necessary.
3. **Incorrect calculation.** The developer may make mistakes in the calculation. For example, the developer may forget to carry over the carry when adding two integers. The developer should carefully check the calculation and make sure that it is correct.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The developer may make mistakes in the logic of the program. For example, the developer may assume that a certain condition is always true when it is not. The developer should carefully check the logic of the program and make sure that it is correct.
5. **Off-by-one error.** The developer may make a mistake when counting or indexing. For example, the developer may forget to add one when counting the number of elements in an array. The developer should carefully check the code for off-by-one errors.
6. **Memory leak.** The developer may not release memory that is no longer needed. This can cause the program to run out of memory and crash. The developer should use the `delete` keyword to release memory that is no longer needed.
7. **Race condition.** The developer may not synchronize access to shared resources. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash. The developer should use locks or other synchronization mechanisms to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.
8. **Deadlock.** The developer may create a situation where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely. The developer should avoid creating deadlocks by ensuring that each thread releases all of the locks that it holds before it blocks.
9. **Buffer overflow.** The developer may write more data to a buffer than it can hold. This can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code. The developer should use the `strlen` function to check the length of a string before writing it to a buffer.
10. **Format string vulnerability.** The developer may use a format string that is vulnerable to a format string attack. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system. The developer should use the `strftime` function to format strings instead of using format strings directly.

AIZU p00070 Combination of Number Sequences

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input is "3 10a", the program will not be able to parse the input and will crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of combinations**. The number of combinations can be calculated using the following formula:

```
C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)
```

However, if the calculation is not done correctly, the program may output incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. The program should be able to handle edge cases, such as when n = 0 or s < 0. If these cases are not handled correctly, the program may crash or output incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect use of variables**. The program should use variables correctly and avoid any potential conflicts. For example, if the variable `n` is used to store both the number of integers in the sequence and the sum of the integers, the program may produce incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect use of functions**. The program should use functions correctly and avoid any potential errors. For example, if the function `sum()` is used to calculate the sum of the integers in the sequence, the program may produce incorrect results.

By following these tips, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving the problem of combination of number sequences.

AIZU p00202 At Boss's Expense

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not clear.** The problem statement does not explicitly state the format of the input, which could lead to confusion. For example, is the budget amount x a single integer, or is it a list of integers? Additionally, the problem statement does not specify how the dishes are ordered. Are they listed in order of increasing price, or in some other order?
2. **The output format is not clear.** The problem statement does not explicitly state the format of the output, which could lead to confusion. For example, should the output be a single integer, or a list of integers? Additionally, the problem statement does not specify how the output should be sorted.
3. **The problem is not well-defined.** The problem statement does not clearly define what it means for a total amount to be "not divisible by any number." For example, does this mean that the total amount cannot be evenly divided by any integer, or does it mean that the total amount cannot be evenly divided by any integer greater than 1?
4. **The problem is computationally difficult.** The problem requires finding the total amount that is closest to the budget amount and is not divisible by any number. This is a computationally difficult problem, as it requires searching through all possible total amounts.
5. **The problem is not interesting.** The problem is not particularly interesting or challenging, as it can be solved using a straightforward algorithm.

Here are some possible solutions to these problems:

1. **The input format can be made more clear by explicitly stating the format of the input data.** For example, the problem statement could state that the input data consists of a single line of text, with the budget amount x followed by a list of the prices of the dishes. Additionally, the problem statement could state that the dishes are listed in order of increasing price.
2. **The output format can be made more clear by explicitly stating the format of the output data.** For example, the problem statement could state that the output data consists of a single line of text, with the total amount that is closest to the budget amount and is not divisible by any number. Additionally, the problem statement could state that the output should be sorted in ascending order.
3. **The problem can be better defined by explicitly stating what it means for a total amount to be "not divisible by any number."** For example, the problem statement could state that a total amount is not divisible by any number if it cannot be evenly divided by any integer greater than 1.
4. **The problem can be made more computationally efficient by using a more efficient algorithm.** For example, the problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm that iteratively adds dishes to the total amount until the total amount is no longer divisible by any number.
5. **The problem can be made more interesting by adding additional constraints or objectives.** For example, the problem could be modified to require finding the total amount that is closest to the budget amount and is not divisible by any number, and that also minimizes the number of dishes that are ordered.

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to put a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the probability**. The probability of success is calculated by summing the probabilities of all possible outcomes. If you make a mistake in calculating any of the probabilities, the final result will be incorrect.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When calculating the probabilities of the different outcomes, it is easy to make a mistake and forget to add or subtract 1. This can lead to a significant error in the final result.
4. **Incorrect handling of special cases**. The problem statement specifies a few special cases, such as when the checker is on the start or the goal square. If you do not handle these cases correctly, the program will not produce the correct output.
5. **Memory errors**. The program may run out of memory if the input is too large. This can be avoided by using a more efficient data structure to store the game state.
6. **Time errors**. The program may take too long to run if the input is too large. This can be avoided by using a more efficient algorithm to solve the problem.
7. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if you round the output to the wrong number of decimal places, the program will not produce the correct output.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
AIZU p02010 Additions

Pain points:
**1. Leading zeros**

The problem states that "leading zeros and unary positive are prohibited". This means that we cannot have a leading zero in the input string, and we cannot have a unary positive expression in the output string. For example, the input string "0123+456" is invalid because it has a leading zero, and the output string "1+2+3+4+5+6" is invalid because it contains a unary positive expression.

**2. Unbalanced parentheses**

The problem does not explicitly state that the input string must be balanced, but it is implied by the fact that the output string must be balanced. For example, the input string "1+2+3+4+5+6" is invalid because it is not balanced.

**3. Incorrect operators**

The problem states that the input string must consist of "'+' and digits", but it does not explicitly state that the operators must be correct. For example, the input string "1+2+3+4+5+6" is invalid because it contains the incorrect operator "+".

**4. Incorrect operands**

The problem states that the input string must consist of "'+' and digits", but it does not explicitly state that the operands must be correct. For example, the input string "1+2+3+4+5+6" is invalid because it contains the incorrect operand "6".

**5. Incorrect results**

The problem states that the output string must be "smaller than or equal to $N$", but it does not explicitly state that the result must be correct. For example, the output string "1+2+3+4+5+6" is invalid because it is greater than $N$.

**6. Incorrect number of replacements**

The problem states that the output string must be "the minimum number of the replaced characters", but it does not explicitly state that the number of replacements must be correct. For example, the output string "1+2+3+4+5+6" is invalid because it requires more than the minimum number of replacements.
