CODECHEF bytesa

Pain points:
* The input number may be very large, so it is important to use a big integer library to handle it.
* The number may not be a valid number, so it is important to check for that before trying to reverse it.
* The reversed number may not be a valid number, so it is important to check for that before printing it.
* The output format is very specific, so it is important to make sure that the output is correct.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer might not use a big integer library, and the input number might overflow.
* The developer might not check if the input number is a valid number, and try to reverse it even if it is not.
* The developer might not check if the reversed number is a valid number, and print it even if it is not.
* The developer might not format the output correctly.

Title:
CODECHEF coolguys

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong formula**

The formula for calculating the probability that the GCD of A and B equals to B is:

```
P(GCD(A, B) = B) = (B - 1) / (N - 1)
```

However, some developers may accidentally use the formula for calculating the probability that A and B are relatively prime:

```
P(A and B are relatively prime) = (N - 1) / (N - 2)
```

This will result in an incorrect answer.

**2. Not handling the case where N is prime**

The formula for calculating the probability that the GCD of A and B equals to B assumes that N is not prime. If N is prime, then the probability is 1. However, some developers may forget to handle this case, and their code will not work correctly for prime values of N.

**3. Using floating-point numbers**

The formula for calculating the probability that the GCD of A and B equals to B involves division. When dividing two integers, the result is always an integer. However, some developers may accidentally use floating-point numbers when calculating the probability, which will result in an incorrect answer.

**4. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The formula for calculating the probability that the GCD of A and B equals to B can be calculated using a simple algorithm. However, some developers may try to use a more complex algorithm, which will be slower and less efficient.

**5. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code to make sure that it is correct. Some developers may forget to test their code, which could result in errors being introduced into the production environment.

CODECHEF marbles

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The problem specifies that `n` and `k` are integers, but the code may incorrectly declare them as floats. This would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation:** The formula for the number of possibilities is `(n-1)! * k!`. The code may incorrectly calculate this formula, resulting in incorrect results.
3. **Off-by-one error:** The code may incorrectly count the number of possibilities, resulting in an off-by-one error. This could occur if the code does not account for the fact that Rohit must choose at least one marble of each color.
4. **Infinite loop:** The code may enter an infinite loop if it does not properly handle the case where `n` is greater than `k`.
5. **Memory leak:** The code may leak memory if it does not properly free the memory that it allocates.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1013_F. AB-Strings

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of operations.** The most common mistake is to count the number of operations as the sum of the lengths of the swapped prefixes. This is incorrect because the lengths of the prefixes may overlap. For example, if we swap the prefixes of length 1 and 2 from the strings "ab" and "bb", the resulting strings will be "ba" and "b". The total length of the swapped prefixes is 3, but the number of operations is only 2.
2. **Not considering the case where one of the strings is empty.** If one of the strings is empty, then no operations are necessary. This is because the empty string can be considered to consist entirely of a or b letters.
3. **Not considering the case where both strings are equal.** If both strings are equal, then no operations are necessary. This is because the two strings can be considered to consist of the same letters.
4. **Using incorrect data types.** The input and output data are strings, so it is important to use the correct data types when reading and writing the data. For example, if you try to read the input data as integers, you will get an incorrect answer.
5. **Using incorrect algorithms.** The problem can be solved using a simple greedy algorithm. However, there are other more efficient algorithms that can be used.
6. **Not handling errors correctly.** The input data may contain errors, such as invalid characters or missing data. It is important to handle these errors correctly so that the program does not crash.
7. **Not testing the code thoroughly.** It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly. This can be done by creating a variety of test cases and checking that the program produces the correct output for each case.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1038_D. Slime

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input values can be very large, so it is important to use the correct data types to store them. For example, using `int` to store a value of `10^9` will cause an overflow error.

**2. Not handling negative values correctly**

The input values can be negative, so it is important to handle them correctly. For example, if a slime with a value of `-1` eats a slime with a value of `1`, the resulting value should be `-2`.

**3. Not considering the order of the slimes**

The slimes will eat each other in a specific order, so it is important to take this into account when solving the problem. For example, if two slimes with values of `1` and `2` are next to each other, the slime with value `2` will eat the slime with value `1` first.

**4. Not considering all possible outcomes**

The slimes can eat each other in many different ways, so it is important to consider all possible outcomes when solving the problem. For example, if there are three slimes with values of `1`, `2`, and `3`, the slime with value `3` could eat either of the other two slimes first.

**5. Making a mistake in the implementation**

Even if you have a good understanding of the problem, it is still possible to make a mistake in the implementation. For example, you could forget to update the value of a slime after it has eaten another slime.

**6. Not testing your code**

It is always important to test your code before submitting it to make sure that it is correct. You can test your code by using a variety of different input values.
Test inputs:
1. ```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

Title:
CODEFORCES 1082_F. Speed Dial

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not specified.**

The input format is not specified in the problem statement. This can lead to confusion and errors when writing the code. For example, if the input is a list of numbers, the code may need to be modified to handle this format.

**2. The output format is not specified.**

The output format is not specified in the problem statement. This can lead to confusion and errors when writing the code. For example, if the output is a list of numbers, the code may need to be modified to handle this format.

**3. The problem is not well-defined.**

The problem is not well-defined in the problem statement. This can lead to confusion and errors when writing the code. For example, it is not clear what is meant by "the minimal total number of digit number presses". Does this mean the minimum number of digits that need to be pressed to dial all of the numbers, or the minimum number of times that each digit needs to be pressed?

**4. The problem is too complex.**

The problem is too complex for a beginner to solve. This can lead to frustration and discouragement. For example, the problem requires the developer to be familiar with dynamic programming, which is a complex algorithm.

**5. The problem is too easy.**

The problem is too easy for a beginner to solve. This can lead to boredom and a lack of challenge. For example, the problem could be solved by simply counting the number of digits in each number.

**6. The problem is not relevant to the developer's interests.**

The problem is not relevant to the developer's interests. This can lead to a lack of motivation and interest in solving the problem. For example, the problem is about phone dialing, which may not be something that the developer is interested in.

**7. The problem is not presented in a clear and concise way.**

The problem is not presented in a clear and concise way. This can lead to confusion and errors when writing the code. For example, the problem statement is long and difficult to understand.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1102_A. Integer Sequence Dividing

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n. However, a developer may accidentally read in multiple integers or other data types. This could lead to incorrect results or a runtime error.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum absolute difference.** The goal of the problem is to find the minimum possible value of |sum(A) - sum(B)|. A developer may incorrectly calculate this value by using the following formula:

```
min_diff = abs(sum(A) - sum(B))
```

However, this formula does not take into account the fact that the sum of the elements in A and B must be equal to n. To correctly calculate the minimum absolute difference, a developer must use the following formula:

```
min_diff = min(abs(sum(A) - sum(B)), abs(sum(A) - n + sum(B)))
```

3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement specifies that n must be an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9. A developer may accidentally try to divide the sequence into two sets when n is not an integer or is less than 1 or greater than 2 * 10^9. This could lead to a runtime error or an incorrect result.
4. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem statement does not specify how the developer should store the elements of the sequence. A developer may incorrectly use a data structure that is not efficient for this problem. For example, a developer may use a linked list to store the elements of the sequence, which would be very inefficient. A better choice would be to use a dynamic array or a hash table.
5. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** The problem statement does not specify which algorithm the developer should use to find the minimum absolute difference. A developer may incorrectly use an algorithm that is not efficient for this problem. For example, a developer may use a brute-force algorithm, which would be very inefficient. A better choice would be to use a divide-and-conquer algorithm or a greedy algorithm.

CODEFORCES 1228_B. Filling the Grid

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong data type. For example, the input may contain a string when it should contain a number. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating over an array, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one element or count one element twice. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output.
4. **Arithmetic errors**. When performing arithmetic operations, it is easy to make a mistake and get the wrong answer. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output.
5. **Memory errors**. If the program allocates too much memory, it may crash or run out of memory. This can also cause the program to produce incorrect output.
6. **Synchronization errors**. If multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is important to ensure that the data is properly synchronized. Otherwise, the program may produce incorrect output or crash.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. If the program is not properly secured, it may be vulnerable to attack. This could allow an attacker to gain access to the program's data or even take control of the program.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design and test your program. You should also use a programming language that has built-in safeguards against common errors.

Pain points:
1 1 2 3
 The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are:

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading in the data. For example, if you forget to add a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The data in this problem is all integers, so it is important to make sure that you are reading in the data as integers. If you accidentally read in the data as strings, the program will not be able to correctly calculate the results.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** This problem is full of opportunities for off-by-one errors. For example, if you forget to add one to the index of a dancer when iterating through the list of dancers, the program will not be able to correctly calculate the total awkwardness of the set.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The logic in this problem is fairly complex, so it is easy to make a mistake. For example, if you forget to check if the total awkwardness of a set is less than k, the program will not be able to correctly determine whether or not the set is valid.
5. **Incorrect output format.** The output format for this problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if you forget to add a newline character between two lines of output, the program will not be able to correctly format the output.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1270_B. Interesting Subarray

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correctly parsed, which can lead to errors in the program's logic. For example, if the input contains a number that is too large, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect array indexing**

When accessing elements of an array, it is important to make sure that the index is within the bounds of the array. Otherwise, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When performing calculations with arrays, it is important to be careful about off-by-one errors. For example, if you are trying to find the index of the smallest element in an array, you need to make sure that you start your search at index 0, not index 1.

**4. Using incorrect data types**

When working with arrays, it is important to use the correct data types. For example, if you are storing integers in an array, you should use the `int` data type, not the `float` data type.

**5. Not handling edge cases**

It is important to handle edge cases in your code. For example, what happens if the input array is empty? What happens if the input array contains only one element?

**6. Using inefficient algorithms**

There are many different ways to solve a problem. When choosing an algorithm, it is important to choose one that is efficient. For example, if you are trying to find the largest element in an array, you should use the `max()` function, not a linear search.

**7. Not commenting your code**

It is important to comment your code so that other developers can understand what it does. This will help to prevent errors and make it easier to debug your code.

**8. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code to make sure that it works correctly. This will help to catch errors and prevent them from causing problems in production.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1467_D. Sum of Paths

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of mod operator.** The mod operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. For example, 5 % 3 is 2. This means that 5 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2.
2. **Using the wrong modulo.** The modulo operator should always be used with the same modulus. For example, if you are using the modulo 10, you should always use the modulo 10 when performing calculations.
3. **Using the modulo operator incorrectly.** The modulo operator should only be used to perform calculations that are within the range of the modulus. For example, if you are using the modulo 10, you should not use the modulo operator to calculate a number that is greater than 10.
4. **Not using the modulo operator correctly.** The modulo operator should always be used in the same order as the other operators in an expression. For example, the expression `a % b + c` should be evaluated as `(a % b) + c`, not `a % (b + c)`.
5. **Using the modulo operator with floating-point numbers.** The modulo operator cannot be used with floating-point numbers. If you need to perform calculations with floating-point numbers, you should use the `fmod()` function instead.
6. **Using the modulo operator with negative numbers.** The modulo operator cannot be used with negative numbers. If you need to perform calculations with negative numbers, you should use the absolute value of the number before using the modulo operator.
7. **Using the modulo operator with zero.** The modulo operator cannot be used with zero. If you need to perform calculations with zero, you should use the `divmod()` function instead.
8. **Using the modulo operator with infinity.** The modulo operator cannot be used with infinity. If you need to perform calculations with infinity, you should use the `math.inf` constant instead.
9. **Using the modulo operator with NaN.** The modulo operator cannot be used with NaN. If you need to perform calculations with NaN, you should use the `math.nan` constant instead.

CODEFORCES 1514_D. Cut and Stick

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input `1 2` is not correct because it does not contain the number of queries. The developer should check the input format and raise an error if it is incorrect.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not always correct. For example, the output `1 2 3` is not correct because it contains more than one integer. The developer should check the output format and raise an error if it is incorrect.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm that does not produce the correct output. For example, the following algorithm is incorrect:

```
def solve(n, q, a):
  # This algorithm is incorrect because it does not consider the length of the subsequences.
  for i in range(q):
    l, r = map(int, input().split())
    print(r - l + 1)

n, q = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
solve(n, q, a)
```

This algorithm will always output the length of the query range, which is not always the minimum number of subsequences needed to partition the range into beautiful subsequences.
4. **Memory limit exceeded**. The developer may use too much memory, which will cause the program to crash. For example, the following code uses a list of size `n * n` to store the frequency of each element in the array, which can easily exceed the memory limit for large values of `n`.

```
def solve(n, q, a):
  # This algorithm uses too much memory.
  freq = [0] * (n * n)
  for i in range(n):
    freq[a[i]] += 1

  for i in range(q):
    l, r = map(int, input().split())
    print(r - l + 1)

n, q = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
solve(n, q, a)
```

5. **Time limit exceeded**. The developer may use an algorithm that takes too long to run, which will cause the program to time out. For example, the following algorithm uses a brute-force approach to find the minimum number of subsequences needed to partition the query range into beautiful subsequences. This algorithm will take O(n^2) time to run, which is too slow for large values of `n`.

```
def solve(n, q, a):
  # This algorithm takes too long to run.
  for i in range(q):
    l, r = map(int, input().split())
    min_subsequences = n
    for j in range(l, r + 1):
      min_subsequences = min(min_subsequences, 1 + (r - j + 1) // (j - l + 1))
    print(min_subsequences)

n, q = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
solve(n, q, a)
```

6. **Other bugs**. There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the developer may forget to check for boundary conditions, or the developer may use incorrect data types. It is important to carefully read the problem statement and to test the code thoroughly to avoid these types of bugs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1541_D. Tree Array

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal algorithm

The tree traversal algorithm is a recursive algorithm that visits each node in the tree exactly once. It can be implemented in a variety of ways, but one common approach is to use a stack to keep track of the nodes that have been visited.

When implementing the tree traversal algorithm, it is important to make sure that the nodes are visited in the correct order. If the nodes are not visited in the correct order, the expected number of inversions in the generated array will be incorrect.

### 2. Incorrect calculation of the expected number of inversions

The expected number of inversions in the generated array can be calculated using the following formula:

```
E[I] = ∑P(A) * I(A)
```

where:

* E[I] is the expected number of inversions in the generated array
* P(A) is the probability of generating array A
* I(A) is the number of inversions in array A

To calculate P(A), we need to know the probability of each node being chosen as the first node in the array. This probability can be calculated using the following formula:

```
P(A) = 1 / n
```

where:

* n is the number of nodes in the tree

Once we know the probability of each node being chosen as the first node in the array, we can calculate the expected number of inversions using the following formula:

```
E[I] = ∑1 / n * I(A)
```

where:

* E[I] is the expected number of inversions in the generated array
* 1 / n is the probability of each node being chosen as the first node in the array
* I(A) is the number of inversions in array A

### 3. Using an incorrect modulus

When calculating the expected number of inversions, it is important to use the correct modulus. The modulus is the number that is used to divide the expected number of inversions. If the modulus is incorrect, the expected number of inversions will be incorrect.

The correct modulus for this problem is 10^9+7. This modulus is used to ensure that the expected number of inversions is a non-negative integer.

### 4. Using an incorrect algorithm to calculate the inverse of a number

The inverse of a number is the number that, when multiplied by the original number, gives a product of 1. To calculate the inverse of a number, we can use the following algorithm:

```
1. Initialize x to the original number.
2. Initialize y to 1.
3. While x ≠ 1:
    * Divide x by 2.
    * Multiply y by 2.
4. Return y.
```

This algorithm will correctly calculate the inverse of a number, as long as the number is not 0.

### 5. Using an incorrect data type to store the expected number of inversions

The expected number of inversions can be a very large number. If we use an incorrect data type to store the expected number of inversions, the expected number of inversions will be incorrect.

The correct data type to use to store the expected number of inversions is a long integer. A long integer is a data type that can store numbers up to 2^63-1. This is more than enough space to store the expected number of inversions.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not specified in the problem statement. The developer may assume that the input format is different from the actual one, which will lead to incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not specified in the problem statement. The developer may assume that the output format is different from the actual one, which will lead to incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the number of pairs**

The developer may incorrectly calculate the number of pairs. For example, the developer may not take into account the fact that the same substring of s may be a subsequence of t in multiple ways.

**4. Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic**

The developer may incorrectly use modulo arithmetic, which will lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may not take into account the fact that the sum of two numbers modulo m may be greater than m.

**5. Incorrect use of the 109 + 7 modulus**

The developer may incorrectly use the 109 + 7 modulus, which will lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may not take into account the fact that the remainder of the division of a number by 109 + 7 may be negative.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain 6 space-separated integers. If the input does not match this format, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is specified to be integers. If the input contains any non-integer values, the program will crash.
3. **Off-by-one error**. When computing the area of the triangle, it is important to make sure that the signs of the cross products are correct. A common mistake is to forget to flip the sign of the cross product if the order of the points is reversed.
4. **Floating-point errors**. When computing the slopes of the sides of the triangle, it is important to make sure that the values are rounded to the nearest integer. Otherwise, the program may incorrectly identify a triangle as being almost right-angled when it is not.
5. **Infinite loop**. If the triangle is degenerate, the program may enter an infinite loop. This can happen if the program tries to divide by zero or if the program tries to take the square root of a negative number.

CODEFORCES 213_A. Game

Pain points:
```
# Codeforces 213_A. Game
Furik and Rubik love playing computer games. Furik has recently found a new game that greatly interested Rubik. The game consists of n parts and to complete each part a player may probably need to complete some other ones. We know that the game can be fully completed, that is, its parts do not form cyclic dependencies. 

Rubik has 3 computers, on which he can play this game. All computers are located in different houses. Besides, it has turned out that each part of the game can be completed only on one of these computers. Let's number the computers with integers from 1 to 3. Rubik can perform the following actions: 

  * Complete some part of the game on some computer. Rubik spends exactly 1 hour on completing any part on any computer. 
  * Move from the 1-st computer to the 2-nd one. Rubik spends exactly 1 hour on that. 
  * Move from the 1-st computer to the 3-rd one. Rubik spends exactly 2 hours on that. 
  * Move from the 2-nd computer to the 1-st one. Rubik spends exactly 2 hours on that. 
  * Move from the 2-nd computer to the 3-rd one. Rubik spends exactly 1 hour on that. 
  * Move from the 3-rd computer to the 1-st one. Rubik spends exactly 1 hour on that. 
  * Move from the 3-rd computer to the 2-nd one. Rubik spends exactly 2 hours on that. 



Help Rubik to find the minimum number of hours he will need to complete all parts of the game. Initially Rubik can be located at the computer he considers necessary. 

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — the number of game parts. The next line contains n integers, the i-th integer — ci (1 ≤ ci ≤ 3) represents the number of the computer, on which you can complete the game part number i. 

Next n lines contain descriptions of game parts. The i-th line first contains integer ki (0 ≤ ki ≤ n - 1), then ki distinct integers ai, j (1 ≤ ai, j ≤ n; ai, j ≠ i) — the numbers of parts to complete before part i.

Numbers on all lines are separated by single spaces. You can assume that the parts of the game are numbered from 1 to n in some way. It is guaranteed that there are no cyclic dependencies between the parts of the game.

Output

On a single line print the answer to the problem.

Note

Note to the second sample: before the beginning of the game the best strategy is to stand by the third computer. First we complete part 5. Then we go to the 1-st computer and complete parts 3 and 4. Then we go to the 2-nd computer and complete parts 1 and 2. In total we get 1+1+2+1+2, which equals 7 hours.
```

## Possible Problems

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the number of parts is not a positive integer, the program will not be able to process the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also important to get correct results. For example, if the output is not a single line of text, the program will not be able to correctly display the results.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program is also important to get correct results. For example, if the program does not take into account all of the dependencies between the parts of the game, the results will be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect data**. The data used in the program is also important to get correct results. For example, if the data contains errors, the program will not be able to process it correctly.
5. **Incorrect implementation**. The implementation of the program is also important to get correct results. For example, if the program is not written in a correct way, it will not be able to run correctly.

CODEFORCES 3_D. Least Cost Bracket Sequence

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a non-empty pattern of even length, consisting of characters "(", ")" and "?". Its length doesn't exceed 5·104. If the input format is incorrect, the program should raise an error.
2. **Incorrect cost of replacing a character "?".** The cost of replacing a character "?" with "(" and ")" should be a non-negative integer. If the cost is negative, the program should raise an error.
3. **No answer.** If there is no regular bracket sequence that can be formed from the given pattern, the program should print -1.
4. **Not unique answer.** If there are multiple regular bracket sequences that can be formed from the given pattern, the program should print any of them.

CODEFORCES 427_A. Police Recruits

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly handling the input data.** The input data may contain errors, such as a negative number for the number of recruits, or a crime occurring before any recruits have been hired. The developer must be careful to check for these errors and handle them appropriately.
2. **Not correctly updating the number of free officers.** The number of free officers changes each time a crime occurs or recruits are hired. The developer must be careful to keep track of this change and update the number of free officers accordingly.
3. **Not correctly calculating the number of untreated crimes.** The number of untreated crimes is the number of crimes that occurred minus the number of free officers. The developer must be careful to correctly calculate this number.
4. **Using inefficient algorithms.** The problem can be solved in O(n) time, but a developer may accidentally use an inefficient algorithm that takes O(n^2) time or more. The developer should carefully choose an algorithm that is efficient for the problem.
5. **Not handling edge cases.** The problem may have edge cases, such as the case where no crimes occur or the case where all crimes are immediately investigated. The developer must be careful to handle these edge cases correctly.
6. **Not testing the code thoroughly.** The developer should write unit tests to thoroughly test the code. This will help to catch bugs and ensure that the code is correct.

By following these tips, developers can avoid common problems and bugs when solving the police recruits problem.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format for this problem is also not very strict, but it does require that the first line of output be an integer and that the second line be a list of lists of integers. If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be correct in order to correctly solve the problem. For example, the program must be able to correctly identify all of the possible ways to arrange the toys into piles. If the logic of the program is incorrect, it will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. The program must be correctly implemented in order to correctly solve the problem. For example, the program must use the correct data structures and algorithms to solve the problem. If the implementation of the program is incorrect, it will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
5. **Incorrect testing**. The program must be correctly tested in order to ensure that it correctly solves the problem.

**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly. For example, if you forget to read the first line of input, your program will not work correctly.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also very specific. You must make sure that you are printing the output in the correct format. For example, if you print the output as a float instead of an integer, your program will not work correctly.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

This problem is full of opportunities for off-by-one errors. For example, if you forget to add 1 to the length of a segment when you are calculating the total length, your program will not work correctly.

**4. Undefined behavior**

This problem can also be solved using undefined behavior. For example, you could try to access an element of an array that is out of bounds. This will usually result in a segmentation fault, but it is still undefined behavior.

**5. Memory leaks**

This problem does not require you to allocate any memory, but it is still possible to create memory leaks. For example, if you forget to free a pointer when you are done with it, you will create a memory leak.

**6. Race conditions**

This problem does not involve any concurrency, but it is still possible to create race conditions. For example, if two threads try to access the same data at the same time, you could get incorrect results.

**7. Deadlocks**

This problem does not involve any concurrency, but it is still possible to create deadlocks. For example, if two threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, you could get a deadlock.

**8. Incorrect data structures**

This problem can be solved using a variety of data structures. However, it is important to choose the correct data structure for the problem. For example, if you use a linked list to store the segments, your program will not work correctly.

**9. Inefficient algorithms**

There are a number of different ways to solve this problem. However, some algorithms are more efficient than others. For example, a brute-force algorithm will not be as efficient as a divide-and-conquer algorithm.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a number that is too large or too small, or it may contain a non-integer value.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may contain a number that is too large or too small, or it may contain a non-integer value.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not be able to find a solution to the problem, or it may find a solution that is not optimal.
4. **Incorrect data structures**. The data structures used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, the data structures may not be able to store the input data efficiently, or they may not be able to perform the necessary operations on the data efficiently.
5. **Incorrect implementation**. The code that implements the algorithm may be incorrect. For example, the code may contain syntax errors, or it may not be able to handle all possible cases.
6. **Incorrect testing**. The test cases used to verify the correctness of the code may be incorrect. For example, the test cases may not test all possible cases, or they may test cases that are not relevant to the problem.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to develop a correct algorithm and implement it correctly. Finally, it is important to test the code thoroughly with a variety of test cases.

Title:
CODEFORCES 573_B. Bear and Blocks

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n, and the second line should contain n space-separated integers h1, h2, ..., hn. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of operations.** The number of operations needed to destroy all towers is equal to the sum of the heights of all the towers. However, if a tower has height 1, it will not be destroyed by the first operation, so the number of operations should be one less than the sum of the heights of all the towers.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the number of operations, it is important to make sure that the index of the current tower is correct. If the index is off by one, the program will not correctly calculate the number of operations.
4. **Memory errors.** If the program does not properly manage its memory, it may run out of memory and crash. This can be caused by allocating too much memory, or by not freeing memory that is no longer needed.
5. **Synchronization errors.** If multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is important to ensure that the data is properly synchronized. If the data is not synchronized, the program may produce incorrect results or crash.
6. **Race conditions.** A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. If the data is not properly protected, the program may produce incorrect results or crash.
7. **Deadlocks.** A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. If a deadlock occurs, the program will not be able to continue running.
8. **Unhandled exceptions.** If the program encounters an unhandled exception, it will crash. This can be caused by a variety of errors, such as invalid input, division by zero, or accessing a memory location that does not exist.
9. **Security vulnerabilities.** If the program is not properly secured, it may be vulnerable to a variety of attacks, such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting.
10. **Performance problems.** The program may run slowly or inefficiently if it is not properly optimized. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as using inefficient algorithms, not using the right data structures, or not caching data.
Test inputs:
```
# 573B. Bear and Blocks

n = int(input())
h = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    if h[i] == 1:
        continue
    ans += h[i]
print(ans)
```

**Incorrect input format:**

```
# 573B. Bear and Blocks

n = int(input())
h = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    if h[i] == 1:
        continue
    ans += h[i]
print(ans + 1)
```

This program will crash because the input format is incorrect. The first line should contain a single integer n, and the second line should contain n space-separated integers h1, h2, ..., hn. However, this program is expecting the second line to contain n + 1 space-separated integers.

**Incorrect calculation of the number of operations:**

```
# 573B. Bear and Blocks

n = int(input())
h = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    if h[i] == 1:
        continue
    ans += h[i]
print(ans - 1)
```

This program will produce an incorrect answer because it is not correctly calculating the number of operations. The number of operations needed to destroy all towers is equal to the sum of the heights of all the towers. However, this program is subtracting 1 from the sum of the heights of all the towers, which is incorrect.

**Off-by-one errors:**

```
# 573B. Bear and Blocks

n = int(input())
h = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 0
for i in range(n - 1):
    if h[i] == 1:
        continue
    ans += h[i]
print(ans)
```

This program will produce an incorrect answer because it is off by one when calculating the index of the current tower. The program is expecting the index of the current tower to be i, but the correct index is i + 1.

**Memory errors:**

```
# 573B. Bear and Blocks

n = int(input())
h = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    if h[i] == 1:
        continue
    ans += h[i]
print(ans)
```

This program will crash because it is not properly managing its memory. The program is allocating a new array of size n + 1 on each iteration of the loop, which is unnecessary. This will eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash.

**Synchronization errors:**

```
# 573B. Bear and Blocks

n = int(input())
h = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    if h[i] == 1:
        continue
    ans += h[i]
print(ans)
```

This program will crash because it is not properly synchronizing access to the shared variable ans. The program is accessing ans on each iteration of the loop, which could cause other threads to overwrite the value of ans. This could lead to incorrect results or a crash.

**Race conditions:**

```
# 573B. Bear and Blocks

n = int(input())
h = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    if h[i] == 1:
        continue
    ans += h[i]
print(ans)
```

This program will produce an incorrect answer because it is not properly handling race conditions. The program is accessing the shared variable ans on each iteration of the loop, which could cause other threads to overwrite the value of ans. This could lead to incorrect results or a crash.

**Deadlocks:**

```

Title:
CODEFORCES 594_E. Cutting the Line

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the input or output.** The input string `s` and the integer `k` are both non-empty, so they should be represented using a data type that can hold any possible value. For example, using `char` for `s` would be incorrect, because `char` can only hold a single character, while `s` can contain multiple characters. Similarly, using `int` for `k` would be incorrect, because `int` can only hold a value up to 2147483647, while `k` can be larger than that.

**2. Not handling the case where `k` is greater than the length of `s`.** In the problem statement, it is stated that `1 ≤ k ≤ |s|`, so we need to make sure that we handle the case where `k` is greater than the length of `s`. One way to do this is to check if `k` is greater than the length of `s` before we start processing the input. If `k` is greater than the length of `s`, then we can simply output `s` without doing any further processing.

**3. Not handling the case where `s` contains duplicate characters.** The problem statement does not specify whether or not `s` can contain duplicate characters. If `s` does contain duplicate characters, then we need to make sure that we handle this case correctly. One way to do this is to sort the characters in `s` in alphabetical order before we start processing the input. This will ensure that the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by splitting `s` into `k` parts is always the one that has the characters in alphabetical order.

**4. Not handling the case where `s` is a palindrome.** A palindrome is a string that is the same backwards and forwards. If `s` is a palindrome, then we need to make sure that we handle this case correctly. One way to do this is to check if `s` is a palindrome before we start processing the input. If `s` is a palindrome, then we can simply output `s` without doing any further processing.

**5. Not handling the case where `s` is empty.** The problem statement does not specify what should happen if `s` is empty. One way to handle this case is to output an empty string. Another way to handle this case is to throw an exception.

Pain points:
```
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, if the input contains more than two integers on the first line, or if the input contains characters other than digits or `.` and `*`, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, if the output contains spaces between the characters, or if the output contains characters other than digits, the program will receive a negative score.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the connected component size**. The program may incorrectly calculate the size of the connected component. For example, if the program does not take into account all of the adjacent cells, or if the program counts the same cell multiple times, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Memory limit exceeded**. The program may use too much memory. This can happen if the program creates a large array to store the connected components, or if the program uses a recursive algorithm that calls itself too many times.
5. **Time limit exceeded**. The program may run too long. This can happen if the program uses a slow algorithm, or if the program gets stuck in an infinite loop.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test your program thoroughly with a variety of different inputs. Finally, it is important to choose an efficient algorithm and implement it carefully.

CODEFORCES 664_C. International Olympiad

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is specified as follows:

```
The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of abbreviations to process. 

Then n lines follow, each containing a single abbreviation. It's guaranteed that each abbreviation contains at most nine digits.
```

A common mistake is to forget to put the number of abbreviations on the first line, or to put it in the wrong format. For example, the following input is incorrect:

```
IAO'15
IAO'2015
IAO'1
IAO'9
IAO'0
```

This input should be formatted as follows:

```
5
IAO'15
IAO'2015
IAO'1
IAO'9
IAO'0
```

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is specified as follows:

```
For each abbreviation given in the input, find the year of the corresponding Olympiad.
```

A common mistake is to output the abbreviations instead of the years. For example, the following output is incorrect:

```
IAO'15
IAO'2015
IAO'1
IAO'9
IAO'0
```

This output should be formatted as follows:

```
1989
12015
1991
1989
1990
```

**3. Incorrect abbreviation format**

The abbreviation format is specified as follows:

```
IAO'y, where y stands for some number of consequent last digits of the current year.
```

A common mistake is to use an abbreviation that does not follow this format. For example, the following abbreviation is incorrect:

```
IAO'1995
```

This abbreviation should be formatted as follows:

```
IAO'95
```

**4. Incorrect year calculation**

The year of the Olympiad is calculated by taking the last n digits of the current year, where n is the number of digits in the abbreviation. For example, the year of the Olympiad with the abbreviation IAO'9 is 1989.

A common mistake is to calculate the year incorrectly. For example, the following code would incorrectly calculate the year of the Olympiad with the abbreviation IAO'9:

```
year = int(abbreviation[-1])
```

This code would incorrectly calculate the year as 9, instead of 1989.

The correct way to calculate the year is as follows:

```
year = int(abbreviation[-len(abbreviation):])
```

This code would correctly calculate the year as 1989.

CODEFORCES 689_A. Mike and Cellphone

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a single integer followed by a string of digits. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single word, either "YES" or "NO". If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will likely receive a incorrect verdict.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The program must correctly implement the algorithm for determining whether or not there is another phone number with the same finger movements. If the logic is incorrect, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will likely receive a incorrect verdict.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** When checking whether or not there is another phone number with the same finger movements, it is important to make sure that you are not accidentally counting the same number twice. This can be a common source of errors, especially when the number of digits in the phone number is small.
5. **Memory leaks.** The program must be careful not to leak memory. This can be a common problem when using dynamic arrays or other memory-intensive data structures.
6. **Race conditions.** The program must be careful to avoid race conditions. This can be a problem when multiple threads are accessing the same data concurrently.
7. **Synchronization issues.** The program must be careful to synchronize access to shared data. This can be a problem when multiple threads are accessing the same data concurrently.

Title:
CODEFORCES 710_E. Generate a String

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains three integers, but the problem statement specifies that n can be up to 10^7. If we use an integer data type to store n, we may overflow. To avoid this, we can use a long long data type.

**2. Not considering the base case**

The problem statement states that initially, the text editor is empty. This means that if n = 0, the answer is 0. However, if we forget to consider this case, our code will not work correctly.

**3. Using the wrong formula**

The problem statement states that it takes zscoder x seconds to insert or delete a letter 'a' from the text file. This means that if we want to insert n letters 'a', it will take us x * n seconds. Similarly, if we want to copy the contents of the entire text file, it will take us y seconds. So, the total time it takes zscoder to generate the input file is x * n + y.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

When calculating the total time, it is important to make sure that we don't make an off-by-one error. For example, if we want to insert n letters 'a', we need to make sure that we insert n + 1 letters, so that the last letter is also included.

**5. Using incorrect logic**

The problem statement states that zscoder wants to find the minimum amount of time needed to generate the input file. This means that we need to find the smallest possible value of x * n + y. However, if we simply add x * n and y, we may not get the smallest possible value. For example, if x = 1 and y = 10, then x * n + y = 1 * n + 10 = 10. However, if we instead subtract y from x * n, we get x * n - y = 1 * n - 10 = -9. This is a smaller value than 10, so it is the correct answer.

Title:
CODEFORCES 731_E. Funny Game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program's output. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect variable declaration**. The variables used in the program must be declared correctly, or the program may not compile. For example, if a variable is declared as a string when it should be an integer, the program will not work correctly.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program must be correct, or the program may not produce the correct output. For example, if the program does not take into account all of the possible cases, the output may be incorrect.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to errors in the program's output. For example, if a programmer forgets to increment a counter by one, the program may skip over an element in the input list.
5. **Indexing errors**. Indexing errors occur when a programmer accesses an element in an array or list using an incorrect index. This can lead to errors in the program's output. For example, if a programmer tries to access the element at index 10 in an array that only has 9 elements, the program will crash.
6. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when a programmer allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
7. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to errors in the program's output or even to the program crashing.
8. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can lead to the program running indefinitely or even to the program crashing.
9. **Buffer overflows**. Buffer overflows occur when a program writes data to a buffer that is not large enough to hold it. This can lead to the program crashing or even to the program being exploited by an attacker.
10. **Format string vulnerabilities**. Format string vulnerabilities occur when a program uses a format string that is not properly sanitized. This can lead to the program being exploited by an attacker.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid common problems and bugs when solving programming problems.

CODEFORCES 777_A. Shell Game

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain a non-integer number, or it may contain more than one integer. If the input format is incorrect, the program should either output an error message or terminate abnormally.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not always correctly followed. For example, the output may contain a non-integer number, or it may contain more than one integer. If the output format is incorrect, the program should either output an error message or terminate abnormally.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the initial position of the ball**

The initial position of the ball is calculated by repeatedly applying the operator's moves to the ball's initial position. However, if the operator's moves are not applied correctly, the initial position of the ball will be incorrect.

Title:
CODEFORCES 869_A. The Artful Expedient

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data contains a lot of integers. If you use an integer type that is too small, it will overflow and give you incorrect results. For example, if you use `int` to store the integers in the input, you will get an overflow error when the integers are larger than `2147483647`.

To avoid this problem, you should use a data type that is large enough to store the integers in the input. For example, you can use `long` or `unsigned long long`.

**2. Not handling the edge cases correctly**

The problem statement mentions that the input guarantees that the given 2n integers are pairwise distinct. However, it is possible that the input contains duplicate integers. If you do not handle this case correctly, your program will crash.

To avoid this problem, you should check if the input contains any duplicate integers. If it does, you should raise an error and exit the program.

**3. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a simple algorithm. However, if you use a complex algorithm, your program will run slowly and you will get a time limit exceeded error.

To avoid this problem, you should use a simple and efficient algorithm. For example, you can use a hash table to store the integers in the input. This will allow you to quickly check if two integers are equal.

**4. Not using the right data structures**

The problem can be solved using a variety of data structures. However, some data structures are more efficient than others.

To avoid using inefficient data structures, you should carefully consider the problem and choose the data structures that are best suited for the task. For example, you can use a hash table to store the integers in the input. This will allow you to quickly check if two integers are equal.

**5. Not using the right programming language**

The problem can be solved in any programming language. However, some programming languages are more efficient than others.

To avoid using an inefficient programming language, you should carefully consider the problem and choose the programming language that is best suited for the task. For example, you can use C++ to solve the problem. This will allow you to write efficient code that runs quickly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 939_B. Hamster Farm

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is given in the form of two integers N and K, followed by a list of K integers. However, the developer may incorrectly parse the input data as a list of strings, which will lead to incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of hamsters that can be transported**

The developer may incorrectly calculate the maximum number of hamsters that can be transported by summing the capacities of all boxes. However, this is not correct, because the boxes must be completely full. The correct way to calculate the maximum number of hamsters that can be transported is to find the largest capacity box and divide the number of hamsters by the capacity of the box.

**3. Incorrect output of the results**

The developer may incorrectly output the results in the wrong format. The correct format is to output two integers: the type of boxes that Dima should buy and the number of boxes of that type Dima should buy. The type of boxes is numbered from 1 to K in the order they are given in input.

**4. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

The developer may incorrectly handle edge cases, such as when the number of hamsters is 0 or when the number of boxes is 0. In these cases, the developer should output the correct answer, which is 0 for both the type of boxes and the number of boxes.

Title:
CODEFORCES 964_D. Destruction of a Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the DFS algorithm.** This is the most common bug that developers encounter when solving this problem. The DFS algorithm is used to traverse a graph and visit all of its vertices. When traversing a tree, it is important to make sure that you do not visit a vertex more than once. One way to do this is to keep track of the vertices that you have already visited in a set.
2. **Incorrect handling of cycles.** A cycle in a graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. If a tree contains a cycle, then it is not possible to destroy all of the vertices in the tree. One way to check for cycles in a graph is to use the following algorithm:
    1. Start at any vertex in the graph.
    2. Mark the vertex as visited.
    3. Follow all of the edges that are connected to the current vertex.
    4. If you reach a vertex that has already been visited, then there is a cycle in the graph.
3. **Incorrect handling of disconnected graphs.** A disconnected graph is a graph that is not connected. If a tree is disconnected, then it is not possible to destroy all of the vertices in the tree. One way to check if a graph is disconnected is to use the following algorithm:
    1. Start at any vertex in the graph.
    2. Mark the vertex as visited.
    3. Follow all of the edges that are connected to the current vertex.
    4. If you reach a vertex that has not already been visited, then mark the vertex as visited and continue following the edges.
    5. If you reach a vertex that has already been visited, then the graph is disconnected.
4. **Incorrect handling of multiple solutions.** There may be multiple ways to destroy all of the vertices in a tree. One way to print all of the possible solutions is to use the following algorithm:
    1. Find all of the vertices that have even degree.
    2. For each vertex that has even degree, print the vertex and then recursively destroy all of the vertices that are connected to it.
    3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all of the vertices in the tree have been destroyed.
5. **Incorrect output formatting.** The output for this problem should be in the following format:
    1. If it is possible to destroy all of the vertices in the tree, print "YES".
    2. If it is not possible to destroy all of the vertices in the tree, print "NO".
    3. If it is possible to destroy all of the vertices in the tree, print the indices of the vertices in order you destroy them.
    4. Each vertex should be printed on a new line.

Here are some tips for avoiding these bugs:

* Use a debugger to help you track down the source of the bug.
* Test your code thoroughly with different input values.
* Make sure that you understand the problem statement and the requirements before you start coding.
* Use the resources available to you, such as online forums and documentation, to help you solve the problem.

Title:
CODEFORCES 991_E. Bus Number

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input number n can be very large, so it's important to use the correct data type to store it. For example, if you use an integer type, you may get an overflow error when n is too large.

**2. Not considering the leading zeroes**

The problem statement states that the real bus number cannot start with a zero. However, if you're not careful, you may accidentally include leading zeroes in your calculation. For example, if n is 1234, you may accidentally count 01234 as a possible variant.

**3. Not considering the order of the digits**

The problem statement states that Vasya may get the order of the digits in the number of the bus wrong. This means that you need to consider all possible permutations of the digits in n. For example, if n is 1234, you need to count 1234, 1324, 1423, 2134, 2314, 2413, 3124, 3214, 3412, 4123, and 4213 as possible variants.

**4. Not considering the duplicates**

The problem statement states that the real bus number cannot contain duplicate digits. This means that you need to remove all duplicates from your list of possible variants. For example, if n is 1234, you need to remove 11234, 12234, 12334, 13324, 13423, 14423, 22134, 22314, 22341, 23314, 23413, 24413, 33124, 33214, 33241, 34412, 34213, 34241, 44123, 44213, and 44231 from your list of possible variants.

**5. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a simple backtracking algorithm. However, there are more efficient algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. For example, you can use a dynamic programming algorithm to solve this problem in O(n) time.

HACKEREARTH arjit-and-printing-press

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of a loop.** The most common mistake is to use a loop to iterate over the input string, but not to update the loop variable after each iteration. This can lead to the loop running indefinitely or repeating the same values multiple times.
2. **Incorrect use of a conditional statement.** Another common mistake is to use a conditional statement to check if a certain condition is met, but not to take any action if the condition is not met. This can lead to the program not working correctly or producing incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect use of a function.** It is important to make sure that functions are used correctly and that they are passed the correct arguments. Otherwise, the function may not work correctly or it may produce incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect handling of errors.** It is important to handle errors gracefully. This means that the program should not crash or produce incorrect results if an error occurs. Instead, the program should print an error message and exit gracefully.
5. **Incorrect use of memory.** It is important to make sure that the program does not use too much memory. This can lead to the program running slowly or crashing.
6. **Incorrect use of files.** It is important to make sure that the program opens and closes files correctly. Otherwise, the program may not work correctly or it may damage the files.
7. **Incorrect use of the internet.** It is important to make sure that the program uses the internet correctly. This means that the program should not consume too much bandwidth or access websites that are not safe.
8. **Incorrect use of security features.** It is important to make sure that the program uses security features correctly. This means that the program should not allow users to access sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions.
9. **Incorrect use of threading.** It is important to make sure that the program uses threading correctly. This means that the program should not create too many threads or allow threads to access shared data incorrectly.
10. **Incorrect use of multiprocessing.** It is important to make sure that the program uses multiprocessing correctly. This means that the program should not create too many processes or allow processes to access shared data incorrectly.

HACKEREARTH check-array

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the array.** The input array is of type `int`, but the developer may accidentally use a data type with a smaller range, such as `short` or `char`. This would cause the program to overflow and produce incorrect results.
2. **Not initializing the array.** The developer may forget to initialize the array to all zeros, which would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
3. **Using the wrong formula for the sum of the elements to the left or right of an index.** The formula for the sum of the elements to the left of an index is `A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[i - 1]`, and the formula for the sum of the elements to the right of an index is `A[i + 1] + A[i + 2] + ... + A[N - 1]`. The developer may accidentally use the wrong formula, which would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
4. **Not handling the case where the array is empty.** The developer may not handle the case where the array is empty, which would cause the program to crash.
5. **Not handling the case where the array has only one element.** The developer may not handle the case where the array has only one element, which would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
6. **Not handling the case where the array has two elements.** The developer may not handle the case where the array has two elements, which would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
7. **Not handling the case where the array has three elements.** The developer may not handle the case where the array has three elements, which would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
8. **Not handling the case where the array has four elements.** The developer may not handle the case where the array has four elements, which would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
9. **Not handling the case where the array has five elements.** The developer may not handle the case where the array has five elements, which would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
10. **Not handling the case where the array has six elements.** The developer may not handle the case where the array has six elements, which would cause the program to produce incorrect results.

Title:
HACKEREARTH dj-boy-and-phone

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of modulo operator**. Modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 = 1. This means that 10 divided by 3 has a remainder of 1. If you are using modulo operator to check if a number is divisible by another number, you need to make sure that you are using the correct operator. For example, the following code will not work:

```
if (number % 3 == 0):
  print("Divisible by 3")
```

The correct code would be:

```
if (number % 3 == 0):
  print("Divisible by 3")
```

2. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when you forget to add or subtract one from a calculation. For example, the following code will print the wrong answer:

```
print(len(list) - 1)
```

This code will print the length of the list minus 2, because the index of the last element in a list is one less than the length of the list. The correct code would be:

```
print(len(list))
```

3. **Incorrect use of variables**. It is important to use variables correctly in your code. For example, the following code will not work:

```
number = 10
number = number + 1
print(number)
```

This code will print the value of number before it is incremented. The correct code would be:

```
number = 10
number += 1
print(number)
```

4. **Incorrect indentation**. Indentation is used to indicate the scope of a block of code. If your code is not properly indented, it will not work correctly. For example, the following code will not work:

```
if (condition):
  print("True")
print("False")
```

The correct code would be:

```
if (condition):
  print("True")

print("False")
```

5. **Missing semicolons**. Semicolons are used to terminate statements in JavaScript. If you forget to add a semicolon to your code, it will not work correctly. For example, the following code will not work:

```
if (condition)
  print("True")
```

The correct code would be:

```
if (condition) {
  print("True")
}
```

Title:
HACKEREARTH gopals-stairs

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect modulo operator**. The modulo operator is used to find the remainder of a division operation. For example, `10 % 3` would return 1, because 10 divided by 3 has a remainder of 1. However, if you are using the modulo operator to find the remainder of a large number, you may get an incorrect answer. This is because the modulo operator only works with positive numbers. If you try to use the modulo operator with a negative number, you will get an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect use of the factorial function**. The factorial function is used to calculate the product of all the numbers from 1 to a given number. For example, `factorial(5)` would return 120, because 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120. However, if you are using the factorial function with a large number, you may get an incorrect answer. This is because the factorial function can only handle numbers up to a certain size.
3. **Incorrect use of the fibonacci function**. The fibonacci function is used to calculate the nth fibonacci number. The fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers. For example, the first 10 fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34. However, if you are using the fibonacci function with a large number, you may get an incorrect answer. This is because the fibonacci function can only handle numbers up to a certain size.
4. **Incorrect use of the recursion function**. The recursion function is used to call a function within itself. This can be a useful tool for solving recursive problems. However, if you are not careful, you can end up with an infinite loop.
5. **Incorrect use of the dynamic programming function**. The dynamic programming function is used to store the results of previous calculations. This can be a useful tool for speeding up recursive problems. However, if you are not careful, you can end up with incorrect results.
6. **Incorrect use of the memoization function**. The memoization function is used to store the results of previous calculations. This can be a useful tool for speeding up recursive problems. However, if you are not careful, you can end up with incorrect results.
7. **Incorrect use of the tabulation function**. The tabulation function is used to store the results of previous calculations. This can be a useful tool for speeding up recursive problems. However, if you are not careful, you can end up with incorrect results.

HACKEREARTH mozart-numbers

Pain points:
Thus, the answer is 8. 1. **Incorrect implementation of the Pisano period algorithm.** The Pisano period algorithm is used to find the period of the Fibonacci sequence modulo a given number. If the implementation of this algorithm is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the sum of the Fibonacci numbers.** The sum of the Fibonacci numbers can be calculated using the following formula:

```
S(n) = F(n+2) - 1
```

where `F(n)` is the nth Fibonacci number. If the calculation of this sum is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The Fibonacci numbers can grow very quickly, so it is important to handle overflow correctly. If overflow is not handled correctly, it can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic.** Modulo arithmetic is used to handle the fact that the Fibonacci numbers can grow beyond the range of integers. If modulo arithmetic is not used correctly, it can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect use of the Sieve of Eratosthenes.** The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a very efficient algorithm for finding all of the prime numbers up to a given number. If the implementation of this algorithm is incorrect, it can lead to incorrect results.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The problem states that `N` and `K` are integers, but the code below uses them as strings. This will cause errors when the values are not valid integers.
2. **Off-by-one error:** The code below uses `i - 1` to index into the `friend_preferences` array, but this will cause an error if `i` is 0.
3. **Incorrect logic:** The code below checks if `friend_preferences[i][j] == 1` for all `i` and `j`, but this is not necessary. It is sufficient to check if `friend_preferences[i][j] == 1` for any `i` and `j`.
4. **Unnecessary code:** The code below includes a `for` loop that iterates over the `friend_preferences` array, but this loop is not necessary. The code could be simplified by removing the loop.
5. **Inefficient code:** The code below uses a `for` loop to iterate over the `friend_preferences` array, but this loop could be made more efficient by using a `zip` function.

Title:
ATCODER p02886 AtCoder Beginner Contest 143 - TAKOYAKI FESTIVAL 2019

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data is a list of integers, so the developer should use an integer data type to store the values. Using a floating-point data type could lead to incorrect results.

**2. Not using the correct algorithm**

The problem can be solved using the following algorithm:

1. Sort the list of integers in descending order.
2. Iterate over the list, starting from the first element. For each element, multiply it by the next element and add the result to the running total.
3. Print the running total.

Using a different algorithm could lead to incorrect results.

**3. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

The problem states that `2 <= N <= 50`, so the developer should check that the input value is within this range. If the input value is not within this range, the developer should throw an exception or return an error code.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

The problem states that `0 <= d_i <= 100`, so the developer should check that the input values are within this range. If an input value is not within this range, the developer should throw an exception or return an error code.

**5. Using inefficient algorithms**

The problem can be solved in O(N log N) time using the algorithm described above. Using a more inefficient algorithm could lead to longer running times.

Title:
ATCODER p03021 AtCoder Grand Contest 034 - Complete Compress

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the BFS algorithm**

The BFS algorithm is a common technique for traversing a graph. It works by starting at a given vertex and exploring all of its adjacent vertices. This process is repeated until all vertices in the graph have been visited.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing the BFS algorithm is to forget to mark the vertices that have already been visited. This can lead to the algorithm getting stuck in an infinite loop.

To avoid this problem, it is important to mark each vertex as it is visited. This can be done by setting a flag to true. Once all of the vertices have been visited, the flag can be set to false.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the DFS algorithm**

The DFS algorithm is another common technique for traversing a graph. It works by starting at a given vertex and exploring all of its unvisited adjacent vertices. This process is repeated until all of the vertices in the graph have been visited.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing the DFS algorithm is to forget to mark the vertices that have already been visited. This can lead to the algorithm visiting the same vertex multiple times.

To avoid this problem, it is important to mark each vertex as it is visited. This can be done by setting a flag to true. Once all of the vertices have been visited, the flag can be set to false.

**3. Incorrect implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm**

The Dijkstra algorithm is a greedy algorithm for finding the shortest path between two vertices in a weighted graph. It works by iteratively finding the vertex with the smallest known distance from the source vertex. This vertex is then added to the set of visited vertices, and its adjacent vertices are updated with their new distances from the source vertex.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing the Dijkstra algorithm is to forget to update the distances of the adjacent vertices. This can lead to the algorithm finding an incorrect shortest path.

To avoid this problem, it is important to update the distances of the adjacent vertices each time a new vertex is added to the set of visited vertices. This can be done by iterating through the adjacent vertices and updating their distances with the following formula:

```
new_distance = current_distance + weight_of_edge
```

**4. Incorrect implementation of the Prim's algorithm**

The Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree in a weighted graph. It works by iteratively adding the edge with the smallest weight to the spanning tree. This process is repeated until all of the vertices in the graph are connected by edges in the spanning tree.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing the Prim's algorithm is to forget to check if the new edge forms a cycle in the spanning tree. This can lead to the algorithm finding an incorrect minimum spanning tree.

To avoid this problem, it is important to check if the new edge forms a cycle in the spanning tree before adding it to the spanning tree. This can be done by iterating through the edges in the spanning tree and checking if the new edge forms a cycle with any of the existing edges.

**5. Incorrect implementation of the Kruskal's algorithm**

The Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree in a weighted graph. It works by iteratively adding the edge with the smallest weight to the spanning tree. This process is repeated until all of the vertices in the graph are connected by edges in the spanning tree.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing the Kruskal's algorithm is to forget to sort the edges by their weights. This can lead to the algorithm finding an incorrect minimum spanning tree.

To avoid this problem, it is important to sort the edges by their weights before adding them to the spanning tree. This can be done by using a sorting algorithm such as quicksort or mergesort.

The problem is about finding the minimum cost to reach the last stone. A common mistake is to think that the cost is the sum of the absolute value of the differences between each two consecutive stones. This is incorrect because the frog can jump to any stone within the range of [i + 1, i + K].

**2. Incorrect implementation of the dynamic programming solution**

The dynamic programming solution for this problem is to use a 2D array `dp[i][j]`, where `i` is the current stone and `j` is the number of jumps remaining. The value of `dp[i][j]` is the minimum cost to reach stone `i` with `j` jumps remaining. The following is the recursive definition of `dp[i][j]`:

```
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1], ..., dp[i + K][0]) + abs(h[i] - h[j])
```

The following is the iterative solution:

```
for i in range(N):
  for j in range(K + 1):
    if j == 0:
      dp[i][j] = h[i]
    else:
      dp[i][j] = min(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1], ..., dp[i + K][0]) + abs(h[i] - h[j])

print(dp[0][K])
```

**3. Incorrect calculation of the minimum cost**

The minimum cost is the value of `dp[0][K]`. A common mistake is to forget to add the cost of the first jump, which is `abs(h[0] - h[1])`.

**4. Runtime error**

The input size of this problem is up to `10^5`, so the naive solution will time out. A common mistake is to use a 2D array to store the entire table of `dp[i][j]`. This will use up too much memory and cause a runtime error.

**5. Memory error**

The input size of this problem is up to `10^5`, so the naive solution will also cause a memory error. A common mistake is to use a 1D array to store the entire table of `dp[i][j]`. This will not work because the array will need to be able to store values up to `10^10`, which is larger than the maximum size of a 1D array.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem before starting to code. It is also important to use a dynamic programming solution that is both efficient and correct.

Title:
ATCODER p03304 SoundHound Inc. Programming Contest 2018 -Masters Tournament- - Ordinary Beauty

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data is given as integers. However, if the developer uses a data type that is not large enough to store the input data, it will cause an overflow error. For example, if the developer uses an integer to store the value of `n`, and `n` is greater than 2^31-1, an overflow error will occur.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The correct algorithm to solve this problem is to use dynamic programming. However, if the developer uses an incorrect algorithm, it will not produce the correct answer. For example, if the developer uses a brute force algorithm, it will take a very long time to run and will not produce the correct answer.

**3. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

The boundary conditions for this problem are that `0 <= d < n <= 10^9` and `2 <= m <= 10^9`. If the developer does not check these boundary conditions, it will cause the program to crash. For example, if the developer tries to calculate the beauty of a sequence with a length of 0, it will cause a divide by zero error.

**4. Using incorrect floating-point arithmetic**

The output of this problem is a floating-point number. However, if the developer uses incorrect floating-point arithmetic, it will cause the output to be incorrect. For example, if the developer uses the `float` data type to store the output, it will not be accurate enough.
Test inputs:
```

Title:
ATCODER p03464 AtCoder Grand Contest 020 - Ice Rink Game

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input consists of an integer K and an array A of K integers. It is important to use the correct data type for K and A. For example, if K is large, it should be stored as a long integer. If A contains a large integer, it should be stored as a long integer or a big integer.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem can be solved using dynamic programming. However, it is important to use the correct algorithm. For example, a naive algorithm would take O(K^2) time. A more efficient algorithm would take O(K) time.

**3. Making a mistake in the implementation**

Even if the algorithm is correct, it is possible to make a mistake in the implementation. For example, it is possible to forget to initialize a variable or to make a calculation error.

**4. Not handling all cases**

The problem statement specifies that there are K rounds. It is important to handle the case where K is 1 or 2. It is also important to handle the case where there are no valid values of N.

**5. Not testing the code**

It is important to test the code to make sure that it works correctly. This can be done by running the code on a variety of test cases.

Title:
ATCODER p03623 AtCoder Beginner Contest 071 - Meal Delivery

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input is a list of three integers, but the code is expecting three separate integers. This can be fixed by changing the `input()` function to `list(map(int, input().split()))`.
2. **Incorrect comparison operator**. The code is comparing the absolute value of the difference between `x` and `a` to the absolute value of the difference between `x` and `b`. This is incorrect because the absolute value of a negative number is always greater than the absolute value of a positive number. The correct comparison operator is `<`.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The code is checking if `abs(x - a)` is less than `abs(x - b)`. This is incorrect because the closer store is the one with the **smaller** absolute value of the difference. The correct logic is to check if `abs(x - a)` is less than or equal to `abs(x - b)`.

Here is the correct code:

```python
x, a, b = list(map(int, input().split()))

if abs(x - a) <= abs(x - b):
    print('A')
else:
    print('B')
```

Title:
ATCODER p03783 AtCoder Regular Contest 070 - NarrowRectangles

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the first line of the input is not `N`, the program may not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong type, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input data is a string instead of an integer, the program may not be able to process it correctly.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When calculating the minimum cost, it is important to make sure that all the calculations are done correctly. A common mistake is to forget to add 1 to the result, which can lead to an incorrect answer.
4. **Infinite loops**. The program may enter an infinite loop if it is not written correctly. This can happen if the program is not able to find a solution to the problem, or if it is not able to break out of a loop.
5. **Memory leaks**. The program may leak memory if it is not written correctly. This can happen if the program allocates memory that it does not need, or if it does not free memory that it has allocated.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may have security vulnerabilities if it is not written correctly. This can happen if the program allows attackers to access sensitive data, or if it allows attackers to execute arbitrary code.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design and test the program. It is also important to use a programming language that is well-suited for the task at hand.

Possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is not explicitly stated, so it is possible that a developer may incorrectly parse the input. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
* **Incorrect algorithm implementation:** The algorithm used to solve this problem is not trivial, and it is possible that a developer may make a mistake in their implementation. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
* **Incorrect floating-point arithmetic:** The output of this problem is required to have an error less than $10^{-4}$. This is a very small tolerance, and it is possible that a developer may make a mistake in their floating-point arithmetic. This could lead to the program producing incorrect output.
* **Incorrect error handling:** The program should handle errors gracefully. For example, if the input is not in the correct format, the program should print an error message and exit.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to carefully implement the algorithm and test it thoroughly. Finally, it is important to handle errors gracefully.

Title:
AIZU p01545 House Moving

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is specified as follows:

```
> n
> x1 x2 ... xn
```

where `n` is the number of luggage and `x1`, `x2`, ..., `xn` are the weights of each piece of luggage. However, if the input format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the input format is `n x1 x2 ... xn`, the program may crash because it cannot parse the first line of input.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is specified as follows:

```
> S
```

where `S` is the total physical strength required to arrange the luggage in order from the lightest. However, if the output format is incorrect, the program may crash or produce incorrect output. For example, if the output format is `S x1 x2 ... xn`, the program may crash because it cannot parse the first line of output.

**3. Incorrect calculation of physical strength**

The physical strength required to move a piece of luggage is equal to the weight of that piece of luggage. However, if the program incorrectly calculates the physical strength required to move a piece of luggage, the output may be incorrect. For example, if the program incorrectly calculates the physical strength required to move a piece of luggage that weighs 10 pounds as 11 pounds, the output will be incorrect.

**4. Incorrect sorting of luggage**

The goal of the program is to arrange the luggage in order from the lightest to the heaviest. However, if the program incorrectly sorts the luggage, the output will be incorrect. For example, if the program sorts the luggage in order from the heaviest to the lightest, the output will be incorrect.

**5. Incorrect calculation of total physical strength**

The total physical strength required to arrange the luggage is equal to the sum of the physical strength required to move each piece of luggage. However, if the program incorrectly calculates the total physical strength required to arrange the luggage, the output will be incorrect. For example, if the program incorrectly calculates the total physical strength required to arrange the luggage as 100 pounds when the correct answer is 110 pounds, the output will be incorrect.

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input data may not be in the correct format. For example, the year, month, or day may be outside the valid range.
* The input data may contain invalid characters.
* The output data may not be in the correct format. For example, the era, year, month, and day may not be separated by spaces.
* The output data may contain invalid characters.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input data and output data. They should also use a robust algorithm to ensure that the program works correctly even if the input data is invalid.

Title:
AIZU p02268 Binary Search

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the number of integers in T which are also in the set S. A naive solution would be to iterate through each element in T and check if it is in S. However, this would be very inefficient, as we would have to perform a linear search on S for each element in T.

A better solution would be to use binary search. Binary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that can be used to find the position of an element in a sorted array. To use binary search, we first need to sort the array S. Then, we can start by looking at the middle element of S. If the middle element is equal to the element we are looking for, then we have found it. Otherwise, we can recursively search the left or right half of the array, depending on whether the element we are looking for is less than or greater than the middle element.

**2. Not handling edge cases correctly**

The problem statement specifies that the elements in S are sorted in ascending order. However, we should also check for the following edge cases:

* The array S is empty.
* The array S contains only one element.
* The array S contains duplicate elements.

If any of these edge cases occur, we need to handle them appropriately. For example, if the array S is empty, then we should return 0. If the array S contains only one element, then we should return 1 if the element is in T, and 0 otherwise. If the array S contains duplicate elements, then we should only count each element once when we are looking for it in T.

**3. Using incorrect data types**

The problem statement specifies that the elements in S and T are integers. However, we should also check that the input data is valid. For example, we should check that the elements in S and T are all positive numbers. We should also check that the number of elements in S and T is within the specified range.

If the input data is invalid, we should handle it appropriately. For example, we could print an error message and exit the program.

**4. Not using the most efficient data structures**

The problem statement specifies that the elements in S are sorted in ascending order. This means that we can use a binary search tree to store the elements in S. A binary search tree is a data structure that allows us to quickly find the location of an element in a sorted array. Using a binary search tree will significantly reduce the time complexity of our algorithm.

**5. Not using the most efficient algorithms**

The problem statement specifies that the elements in S are sorted in ascending order. This means that we can use a divide-and-conquer algorithm to find the number of elements in T that are also in S. A divide-and-conquer algorithm is an algorithm that breaks down a problem into smaller subproblems, which are then solved recursively. Using a divide-and-conquer algorithm will significantly reduce the time complexity of our algorithm.
