CODECHEF anuund

Pain points:
The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are:

1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem statement is not very clear, so it is important to read it carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked. For example, it is not immediately obvious that the elements of the array must be rearranged in such a way that the following inequality holds: A[0] ≤ A[1] ≥ A[2] ≤ A[3] ≥ A[4], and so on. Operations ≤ and ≥ should alter.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution to this problem is not very difficult, but there are a few ways to implement it incorrectly. For example, one common mistake is to forget to check if the array is empty. Another common mistake is to not properly handle the case where the array contains duplicate elements.
3. **Incorrect testing of the solution.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly. One way to do this is to create a few test cases and run your solution on them. Another way to test your solution is to use a unit testing framework.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer may incorrectly assume that the array is always sorted. This would lead to the solution incorrectly outputting the elements of the array in the same order as they appear in the input.
* The developer may incorrectly implement the logic for checking if the array is empty. This would lead to the solution incorrectly outputting an empty array even if the input array is not empty.
* The developer may incorrectly implement the logic for handling duplicate elements. This would lead to the solution incorrectly outputting the elements of the array in an incorrect order.

Title:
CODECHEF chrl3

Pain points:
1. The developer may not correctly understand the problem statement. For example, they may think that they need to remove all the numbers from the sequence in a single move, or that they need to remove all the numbers in the same order as they appear in the input.
2. The developer may not correctly implement the algorithm to find the minimal number of moves required to remove all the numbers from the sequence. For example, they may not correctly account for the fact that the subsequence must be non-decreasing.
3. The developer may not correctly handle the edge cases. For example, they may not correctly handle the case where the input sequence is empty.
4. The developer may not correctly format their output. For example, they may not output the correct number of digits after the decimal point.
5. The developer may not correctly submit their code to the competition website.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

1. Read the problem statement carefully and make sure you understand it before you start coding.
2. Use a clear and concise programming style.
3. Write unit tests to verify that your code is correct.
4. Test your code on a variety of input data sets, including edge cases.
5. Make sure to format your output correctly.
6. Submit your code on time and follow the competition rules.

Title:
CODECHEF etmx04

Pain points:
**1. The input may not be a series of numbers.** For example, the input may contain letters or special characters. The developer should check if the input is a valid series of numbers before processing it.
2. The input may not contain any numbers. In this case, the developer should return an empty string or a default value.
3. The input may contain negative numbers. The developer should ignore negative numbers when calculating the least distance.
4. The input may contain duplicate numbers. The developer should only consider the first occurrence of each number when calculating the least distance.
5. The least distance may be 0. In this case, the developer should return 0.
6. The least distance may be a non-integer number. The developer should round the least distance to the nearest integer.

Title:
CODECHEF kttable

Pain points:
1. **Inconsistent input format**. The input format specifies that the first line of each test case should contain a single integer N denoting the number of students. However, the example input contains a test case with 3 students, but the first line of the input contains the integer 2.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input format specifies that the second line of each test case should contain N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the moments of time by when the corresponding student should finish cooking. However, the example input contains the integer 10 instead of a space-separated list of integers.
3. **Off-by-one error**. The example output for the second test case should be 2, because the second student is the only one who will be able to fit in time. However, the output is 1.
4. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm for solving this problem should iterate over the list of students and check if each student has enough time to cook. However, the algorithm in the example solution does not check if the students have enough time to cook.

Example 3:
The radii of the stacks are: {14}, {5}, {10}, {12}, {18}.

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The developer may incorrectly implement the algorithm, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may forget to check if the current disk can be put on any of the available stacks, or the developer may incorrectly choose the stack to put the current disk on.
* **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The developer may incorrectly handle edge cases, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may not handle the case where there are no stacks available to put the current disk on, or the developer may not handle the case where the current disk is larger than all of the disks in the stacks.
* **Incorrect use of data structures.** The developer may incorrectly use data structures, which could lead to incorrect results or inefficient code. For example, the developer may use a hash table to store the stacks, which could be inefficient if the number of stacks is large.
* **Incorrect error handling.** The developer may incorrectly handle errors, which could lead to incorrect results or crashes. For example, the developer may not handle the case where the input is invalid, or the developer may not handle the case where the algorithm runs out of memory.

By being aware of these potential problems and bugs, developers can avoid them and write more efficient and correct code.

CODEFORCES 1030_D. Vasya and Triangle

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input should be a single line containing three integers n, m, and k, separated by spaces. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the area of the triangle**. The area of a triangle is calculated using the formula $\frac{1}{2}ab\sin{C}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lengths of the sides of the triangle. If the lengths of the sides are not integers, the area will not be an integer, and the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single line containing the word "YES" followed by the three lines of coordinates of the points. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be accepted by the judge.
4. **Incorrect solution**. There may be no solutions to the problem, or there may be multiple solutions. If the program does not find any solutions, or if it finds the wrong solution, it will not be accepted by the judge.
5. **Runtime errors**. The program may run out of memory or time, or it may produce incorrect results due to a bug in the code.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the program thoroughly with a variety of inputs to make sure that it works correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1053_B. Vasya and Good Sequences

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a sequence of integers. If we use the wrong data type to store the integers, it may cause problems. For example, if we use `int` to store the integers, and the integers are too large, it may cause an overflow.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the number of pairs of integers (l, r) such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n and the sequence a_l, a_{l + 1}, ..., a_r is good. We can use a brute-force algorithm to solve this problem. However, this algorithm is too slow. We can use a more efficient algorithm to solve this problem.

**3. Not handling corner cases**

The problem statement mentions some corner cases. We need to make sure that our solution handles these corner cases correctly.

**4. Making a logical error**

When solving a problem, it is easy to make a logical error. We need to be careful to avoid making logical errors.

**5. Not testing your code**

Title:
CODEFORCES 1096_D. Easy Problem

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a string of length greater than 10^5, or a string that contains non-lowercase Latin letters.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer, which is the minimum possible ambiguity of the statement after Vasya deletes some (possibly zero) characters so the resulting statement is easy.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the ambiguity.** The ambiguity of the statement is calculated incorrectly. For example, the ambiguity may be calculated for a subsequence of the statement that does not contain the subsequence hard, or the ambiguity may be calculated for a subsequence of the statement that is not a contiguous substring of the original statement.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The code may not handle edge cases correctly, such as the case where the statement is empty, or the case where the statement contains only the letters h, a, r, and d.
5. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The code may use data structures incorrectly, such as using a hash table to store the characters in the statement, or using a linked list to store the subsequences of the statement.
6. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** The code may use algorithms incorrectly, such as using a brute-force algorithm to find all subsequences of the statement that contain the subsequence hard, or using a greedy algorithm to find the minimum possible ambiguity of the statement.
7. **Incorrect error handling.** The code may not handle errors correctly, such as the case where the input is not in the correct format, or the case where the code runs out of memory.
8. **Incorrect testing.** The code may not be tested thoroughly, which can lead to bugs that are not caught until the code is deployed in production.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements. It is also important to test the code thoroughly with a variety of input data.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1144_A. Diverse Strings

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a sequence of strings, so the developer should use a list or a string array to store the strings. Using the wrong data type, such as a list of integers, will cause the program to crash.

**2. Not handling invalid input**

The input data may contain invalid strings, such as strings that contain non-alphabetic characters or strings that are too long. The developer should check the input data for validity and handle invalid input gracefully.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The logic used to determine whether a string is diverse is incorrect. For example, the developer may check whether the string contains all 26 letters of the alphabet, when in fact only the letters that appear in the string need to be consecutive.

**4. Not handling corner cases**

The developer should handle corner cases, such as the empty string and the string that contains only one letter.

**5. Using inefficient algorithms**

The developer may use inefficient algorithms to solve the problem, such as a brute-force algorithm. This can lead to a slow running time, especially for large input data sets.

**6. Not testing the code**

The developer should test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and works as expected. This can be done by writing unit tests or by manually testing the code with a variety of input data sets.

```

where `n` is the number of towns, `m` is the number of roads, `q` is the number of plans, and `u_i`, `v_i`, and `w_i` are the endpoints and price of the `i`th road, respectively. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format for this problem is as follows:

```
p_1
p_2
...
p_q
```

where `p_i` is the lowest fee that Shiro must pay to travel from town 1 to town n in the `i`th plan. If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.
* **Incorrect algorithm:** The algorithm used to solve this problem is as follows:

1. Initialize a graph `G` with `n` vertices and `m` edges.
2. For each road `(u, v, w)` in the input, add an edge from `u` to `v` with weight `w`.
3. For each plan `(t, x)` in the input, update the weight of edge `t` to `x`.
4. Find the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex n in the updated graph.
5. The lowest fee that Shiro must pay to travel from town 1 to town n in the `i`th plan is the weight of the shortest path found in step 4.

If the algorithm used to solve the problem is incorrect, the program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.
* **Incorrect data structures:** The data structures used to solve this problem are as follows:

* A graph `G` to represent the road network.
* A priority queue to find the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex n.

CODEFORCES 1219_G. Harvester

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect variable type**. The variables used in the program must be of the correct type. For example, if a variable is declared as an integer but is used to store a floating-point number, the program will crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to incorrect results. For example, if a programmer is counting the number of elements in an array, they may forget to increment the counter by one after each iteration, which will result in one element being missed.
4. **Logic errors**. Logic errors occur when the programmer makes a mistake in the logical flow of the program. For example, if a programmer is trying to find the maximum value in an array, they may compare the first element to the second element and then stop, even though there may be a larger value later in the array.
5. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when the programmer allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
7. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, but neither thread can do so. This can lead to the program being stuck in an infinite loop.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities occur when the programmer makes a mistake that allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the program or data. For example, if a programmer does not properly validate user input, an attacker could inject malicious code into the program.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully follow the input format, use the correct variable types, and test the program thoroughly. It is also important to be aware of the common types of errors that programmers make and to take steps to avoid them.

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement is quite long and detailed, so it is important to read it carefully and make sure that you understand all the requirements. For example, it is important to note that Nikolay can start in any room on any floor, and that he never visits the same room twice.
* **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution to this problem is not particularly difficult, but there are a few common mistakes that developers make. For example, it is important to make sure that you correctly handle the case where there are no staircases in the house.
* **Incorrect testing of the solution.** It is always important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it to Codeforces. This will help you to catch any bugs that you may have missed in your implementation.

Here are some specific examples of problems and bugs that developers may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement:** A developer might incorrectly assume that Nikolay can only start in a room on the first floor. This would lead to a solution that only visits rooms on the first floor, which is incorrect.
* **Incorrect implementation of the solution:** A developer might incorrectly implement the logic for checking whether there is a staircase between two rooms. This could lead to a solution that incorrectly counts the number of rooms that Nikolay can visit.
* **Incorrect testing of the solution:** A developer might not test their solution on a variety of different input cases. This could lead to a solution that fails on some test cases, even though it appears to be correct.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems and bugs:

* **Read the problem statement carefully and make sure that you understand all the requirements.** If you are not sure about something, ask a question on the Codeforces forum.
* **Implement your solution step-by-step and test it on small input cases.** This will help you to catch any bugs early on.
* **Write unit tests for your solution.** Unit tests will help you to catch bugs that you might have missed in your implementation.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1304_D. Shortest and Longest LIS

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the LIS algorithm.** The LIS algorithm is a well-known algorithm for finding the longest increasing subsequence in a given sequence. However, there are many different implementations of the algorithm, and some of them are more prone to errors than others. It is important to make sure that the implementation of the LIS algorithm is correct, as any errors in the implementation could lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The LIS algorithm can be used to find the longest increasing subsequence in a sequence of any length. However, there are some edge cases that need to be handled carefully. For example, what happens if the input sequence is empty? What happens if the input sequence contains only one element? It is important to make sure that the LIS algorithm handles these edge cases correctly, as any errors in the handling of these edge cases could lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The LIS algorithm can be implemented using a variety of data structures. However, some data structures are more efficient than others. It is important to choose the right data structure for the problem at hand, as using an inefficient data structure could lead to slow performance.
4. **Incorrect use of time and space complexity.** The LIS algorithm has a time complexity of O(nlogn), where n is the length of the input sequence. It is important to make sure that the implementation of the LIS algorithm does not exceed this time complexity, as doing so could lead to slow performance. The LIS algorithm also has a space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input sequence. It is important to make sure that the implementation of the LIS algorithm does not exceed this space complexity, as doing so could lead to memory problems.
5. **Incorrect interpretation of the problem statement.** The problem statement for this problem is quite clear, but it is still possible to make mistakes when interpreting it. For example, it is important to make sure that you understand what is meant by the "length of the LIS" and how to calculate it. It is also important to make sure that you understand what is meant by the "minimum length of the LIS" and the "maximum length of the LIS". If you misinterpret the problem statement, you are likely to get incorrect results.

CODEFORCES 161_A. Dress'em in Vests!

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always followed correctly. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may not be separated by spaces. This can cause the program to crash or to output incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect data types**. The input data may be of the wrong data type. For example, the input may contain strings instead of numbers. This can cause the program to crash or to output incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect calculations**. The program may perform incorrect calculations, such as dividing by zero or taking the square root of a negative number. This can cause the program to crash or to output incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The program may output the results in the wrong format. For example, the program may output the results in a different order than expected, or it may not include all of the required information. This can make it difficult to understand the results of the program.
5. **Other bugs**. There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the program may not handle errors correctly, or it may use inefficient algorithms. These bugs can cause the program to crash, to run slowly, or to output incorrect results.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and to test the program thoroughly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 180_C. Letter

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a non-empty string consisting of uppercase and lowercase letters. If the input is not in the correct format, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single number. If the output is not in the correct format, the program will not produce the correct answer.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of actions.** The number of actions required to make the message fancy is the number of lowercase letters that are not to the left of any uppercase letters. To calculate this number, the program must first find all of the lowercase letters in the message. Then, it must find all of the uppercase letters in the message. Finally, it must subtract the number of uppercase letters from the number of lowercase letters to get the number of actions required.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** There are a few edge cases that the program must handle correctly. For example, if the message is empty, the number of actions required is 0. If the message contains only uppercase letters, the number of actions required is 0. If the message contains only lowercase letters, the number of actions required is the length of the message.
5. **Incorrect use of variables.** The program must use variables correctly to store the input, the output, and the intermediate calculations. If the program uses variables incorrectly, it will not produce the correct answer.
6. **Incorrect logic.** The program must use correct logic to calculate the number of actions required to make the message fancy. If the program's logic is incorrect, it will not produce the correct answer.
7. **Incorrect implementation.** The program must be implemented correctly in order to produce the correct answer. If the program is not implemented correctly, it will not produce the correct answer.

CODEFORCES 203_D. Hit Ball

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect type annotations**. The problem statement specifies that the input and output should be integers, but the code below uses floats. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect assumptions**. The problem statement specifies that the ball will hit the door, but the code below does not check for this condition. This can lead to the program crashing.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. The problem statement specifies that the ball will hit the door when its y-coordinate is equal to 0, but the code below checks for a y-coordinate of 1. This can lead to the program missing the correct answer.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The problem statement specifies that the ball will bounce off the ceiling, floor, and walls of the corridor, but the code below only bounces the ball off the ceiling and floor. This can lead to the program giving an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect implementation**. The code below uses a brute-force approach to solve the problem, which can be very inefficient. There are more efficient ways to solve this problem, such as using a ray-tracing algorithm.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement. It is also important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct.
Test inputs:
1. Incorrect type annotations:
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 228_C. Fractal Detector

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is n, m (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) — the number of rows and columns of the field, correspondingly. 
Next n lines contain m characters each — the description of the field, painted by Vasya. Character "." represents a white cell, character "*" represents a black cell.
It is guaranteed that the field description doesn't contain other characters than "." and "*".
A developer may incorrectly parse the input format and get an incorrect answer.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem is a single integer — the number of squares on the field, such that these squares contain a drawn fractal, which can be obtained as described above.
A developer may incorrectly format the output and get a wrong answer.

3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm for finding the number of squares on the field that contain a fractal. This can happen if the developer does not correctly account for all of the possible cases.

4. **Incorrect data structures**. The developer may use incorrect data structures to store the input data or the output data. This can lead to errors in the program's performance or to incorrect results.

5. **Incorrect error handling**. The developer may not handle errors correctly. This can lead to the program crashing or to incorrect results.

6. **Incorrect testing**. The developer may not test the program correctly. This can lead to the program having bugs that are not caught until it is deployed in production.

7. **Incorrect documentation**. The developer may not provide adequate documentation for the program. This can make it difficult for other developers to understand how the program works and to use it correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 277_B. Set of Points

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be two integers n and m, separated by a space. If the input format is incorrect, the program should print an error message and exit.
2. **Incorrect values of n and m**. The values of n and m should be integers greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 100. If the values of n and m are incorrect, the program should print an error message and exit.
3. **No solution**. If there is no set of n points with the convexity of exactly m, the program should print "-1".
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be n pairs of integers, each pair representing the coordinates of a point. The coordinates of each point should be integers and should not exceed 108 in their absolute value. If the output format is incorrect, the program should print an error message and exit.
5. **Bugs in the algorithm**. The algorithm used to generate the set of points may contain bugs. For example, the algorithm may not generate a valid set of points, or it may generate a set of points that does not have the desired convexity.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format and the values of n and m. The algorithm should also be carefully tested to ensure that it generates valid sets of points with the desired convexity.

CODEFORCES 29_D. Ant on the Tree

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or it may contain more than one space between two numbers.
2. The input data is not valid. For example, the input may contain a graph that is not a tree, or it may contain a list of leaves that does not contain all of the leaves in the graph.
3. The output format is not correct. For example, the output may contain a number that is not an integer, or it may not contain the correct number of numbers.
4. The algorithm is incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not visit all of the vertices in the graph, or it may not visit the leaves in the correct order.
5. The program has a runtime error. For example, the program may run out of memory, or it may crash.
6. The program has a logic error. For example, the program may produce the wrong output even though the input is valid and the algorithm is correct.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

* Make sure that you understand the input format and the output format.
* Validate the input data to make sure that it is valid.
* Test your algorithm on a variety of input data to make sure that it is correct.
* Use a debugger to help you find and fix logic errors.
* Use a compiler with warnings and errors enabled to help you find potential problems.

By following these tips, you can help to ensure that your program is correct and free of bugs.

CODEFORCES 323_B. Tournament-graph

Pain points:
1. **The input format is incorrect.** The input should be a single integer n, representing the number of vertices in the graph. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to parse the input and will likely crash.
2. **The output format is incorrect.** The output should be a matrix of n rows and n columns, where each entry in the matrix is either 0 or 1. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to print the output and will likely crash.
3. **The program does not correctly construct the tournament graph.** The tournament graph must have exactly one edge between any two distinct vertices. Additionally, the graph must not contain any self-loops. If the program does not correctly construct the tournament graph, the output will be incorrect.
4. **The program does not correctly check for the existence of a path from vertex v to vertex u.** A path from vertex v to vertex u is a sequence of vertices such that each vertex in the sequence is adjacent to the next vertex in the sequence. If the program does not correctly check for the existence of a path from vertex v to vertex u, the output may be incorrect.
5. **The program does not correctly check for the existence of a tournament graph with n vertices.** If there does not exist a tournament graph with n vertices, the program should print -1. If the program does not correctly check for the existence of a tournament graph with n vertices, the output may be incorrect.

2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may not be in the correct data type. For example, the first line may contain a string instead of an integer, or the second line may contain a floating-point number instead of an integer, or the third line may contain a string instead of two integers.
3. **Incorrect range**. The input data may not be in the correct range.

**2. The output format is not specified.** The output format is not specified in the problem statement. This could lead to confusion and errors when implementing the solution.

**3. The problem is not well-defined.** The problem is not well-defined. For example, it is not clear what is meant by "the minimum number of elements to change to make the array k-periodic". Does this mean the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array k-periodic, or the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array k-periodic and still have the same elements?

Title:
CODEFORCES 392_C. Yet Another Number Sequence

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the Fibonacci sequence**

The Fibonacci sequence is a well-known sequence, but it is easy to make mistakes when implementing it. One common mistake is to use the wrong recurrence relation. For example, the following code would not correctly implement the Fibonacci sequence:

```
def fibonacci(n):
  if n == 0:
    return 0
  elif n == 1:
    return 1
  else:
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```

This code would return the following sequence:

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
```

which is not the Fibonacci sequence. The correct recurrence relation for the Fibonacci sequence is:

```
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)
```

where F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the new sequence**

The new sequence is defined by the formula:

```
A(k) = F(i) * i^k
```

where F(i) is the ith Fibonacci number and i^k is the kth power of i. One common mistake when implementing this formula is to use the wrong order of operations. For example, the following code would not correctly implement the new sequence:

```
def new_sequence(n, k):
  sum = 0
  for i in range(1, n + 1):
    sum += fibonacci(i) * i**k
  return sum
```

This code would return the following sequence:

```
0, 1, 1, 4, 14, 44, 122, 330, 882, ...
```

which is not the new sequence. The correct order of operations for this formula is to first calculate the Fibonacci number and then raise it to the kth power.

**3. Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic**

The answer to this problem can be very large, so it is important to use modulo arithmetic to avoid overflow. One common mistake is to forget to use modulo arithmetic when calculating the sum of the new sequence. For example, the following code would not correctly calculate the sum modulo 1000000007:

```
def main():
  n, k = map(int, input().split())
  sum = 0
  for i in range(1, n + 1):
    sum += fibonacci(i) * i**k
  print(sum)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
```

This code would print the following output:

```
1022373059999999999
```

which is not the correct answer modulo 1000000007. The correct code would use modulo arithmetic to calculate the sum, as follows:

```
def main():
  n, k = map(int, input().split())
  sum = 0
  for i in range(1, n + 1):
    sum += fibonacci(i) * i**k % 1000000007
  print(sum)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
```

**4. Incorrect input format**

The input for this problem is two space-separated integers n and k. One common mistake is to forget to include the space between the two integers. For example, the following code would not correctly read the input:

```
def main():
  n, k = input().split()
  print(fibonacci(n) * k**n)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
```

This code would raise the following error:

```
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'nk'
```

The correct code would include the space between the two integers, as follows:

```
def main():
  n, k = input().split()
  print(fibonacci(n) * k**n)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
```

**5. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer. One common mistake is to print
Test inputs:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the Fibonacci sequence**

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())

def fibonacci(n):
  if n == 0:
    return 0
  elif n == 1:
    return 1
  else:
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

print(fibonacci(n) * k**n)
```

**2. Incorrect implementation of the new sequence**

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())

def new_sequence(n, k):
  sum = 0
  for i in range(1, n + 1):
    sum += fibonacci(i) * i**k
  return sum

print(new_sequence(n, k))
```

CODEFORCES 442_B. Andrey and Problem

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n, and the second line should contain n real numbers. If the input format is not correct, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the output should be a single real number. If the output format is not correct, the program will not produce the correct answer.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the probability**. The probability that Andrey will not get upset is the probability that at least one of his friends comes up with a problem and the probability that he does not get more than one problem. The probability that at least one of his friends comes up with a problem is 1 - (1 - p1) * (1 - p2) * ... * (1 - pn), where pi is the probability that the i-th friend comes up with a problem. The probability that he does not get more than one problem is (1 - p1) * (1 - p2) * ... * (1 - pn). The total probability is 1 - (1 - p1) * (1 - p2) * ... * (1 - pn) + (1 - p1) * (1 - p2) * ... * (1 - pn).
4. **Floating-point rounding errors**. The probability that Andrey will not get upset is a floating-point number. When the probability is rounded to 10 - 9, the rounding error may be significant. This can lead to the program producing an incorrect answer.

Title:
CODEFORCES 560_C. Gerald's Hexagon

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format specifies that the first line should contain 6 space-separated integers. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to process the input and will throw an error.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format specifies that the output should be a single integer. If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to produce the correct output and will throw an error.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the number of triangles**

The number of triangles can be calculated by dividing the perimeter of the hexagon by 3. However, if the perimeter of the hexagon is not divisible by 3, the program will need to round the number of triangles up to the nearest integer.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

When calculating the number of triangles, it is important to make sure that all of the triangles are counted. One common mistake is to forget to count the triangle that is formed by the three longest sides of the hexagon.

**5. Floating-point errors**

When dividing the perimeter of the hexagon by 3, it is important to make sure that the calculation is done using integers. If the calculation is done using floating-point numbers, the result may be inaccurate.

**6. Memory leaks**

The program should be careful not to allocate any memory that it does not need. If the program allocates too much memory, it may eventually run out of memory and crash.

**7. Race conditions**

If the program is multi-threaded, it is important to make sure that the threads do not access shared data concurrently. If the threads do not access shared data concurrently, the program may produce incorrect results.
Test inputs:

Title:
CODEFORCES 586_E. Alice, Bob, Oranges and Apples

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line of the input contains two integers, x, y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 1018, xy > 1) — the number of oranges and apples that were initially in the bag. If the input format is not followed, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce an incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the string that you print should consist of at most 106 characters. It is guaranteed that if the answer exists, its compressed representation exists, consisting of at most 106 characters. If there are several possible answers, you are allowed to print any of them. If the output format is not followed, the program will not be able to correctly print the output and will produce an incorrect result.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program should be correct in order to correctly solve the problem. If the logic is incorrect, the program will not be able to find the correct answer and will produce an incorrect result.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program should not leak memory. If the program leaks memory, it will eventually run out of memory and crash.
5. **Race conditions**. The program should not have any race conditions. Race conditions can occur when multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time and can lead to incorrect results.
6. **Deadlocks**. The program should not have any deadlocks. Deadlocks can occur when multiple threads are waiting for each other to release a lock and can lead to the program being stuck in an infinite loop.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program should not have any security vulnerabilities. Security vulnerabilities can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or to the data that it is processing.
8. **Performance issues**. The program should be efficient and should not have any performance issues. Performance issues can make the program slow and unresponsive.

Title:
CODEFORCES 609_A. USB Flash Drives

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always strictly followed, which can lead to errors in the program's output. For example, if the input contains a space between two integers, the program may interpret the space as a delimiter and read the two integers as separate values. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect variable type.** The variables used in the program must be of the correct type. For example, if a variable is declared as an integer, but it is assigned a value that is not an integer, the program will not work correctly.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic of the program must be correct. For example, if the program is supposed to find the minimum value of a set of numbers, but it instead finds the maximum value, the program will not produce the correct output.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors occur when the program misses or adds one element to a calculation. For example, if the program is supposed to find the sum of the first 100 numbers, but it only adds the first 99 numbers, the program will produce an incorrect result.
5. **Indexing errors.** Indexing errors occur when the program accesses an element of an array or list using an incorrect index. For example, if the program is supposed to access the first element of an array, but it instead accesses the second element, the program will produce an incorrect result.
6. **Arithmetic errors.** Arithmetic errors occur when the program performs an arithmetic operation incorrectly. For example, if the program is supposed to divide two numbers, but it instead multiplies them, the program will produce an incorrect result.
7. **Memory errors.** Memory errors occur when the program allocates too much or too little memory. For example, if the program allocates too much memory, it may run out of memory and crash. If the program allocates too little memory, it may not be able to store all of the data it needs and will produce incorrect results.
8. **Synchronization errors.** Synchronization errors occur when multiple threads in a program access the same data at the same time. This can lead to data corruption and incorrect results.
9. **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, but neither thread can release the resource because it is waiting for the other thread to release it first. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely.
10. **Race conditions.** Race conditions occur when the outcome of a program depends on the order in which two or more threads execute. This can lead to incorrect results or even program crashes.

CODEFORCES 793_E. Problem of offices

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or it may contain a number that is too large or too small.

To avoid this problem, you should check the input format before you start processing it. You can do this by using the `int()` function to convert the input to an integer, or by using the `isdigit()` function to check if the input is a number.

### 2. Incorrect output format

The output format is also not always correctly followed. For example, the output may not be a string, or it may not be the correct length.

To avoid this problem, you should check the output format before you print it. You can do this by using the `str()` function to convert the output to a string, or by using the `len()` function to check the length of the output.

### 3. Incorrect data type

The data type of the input and output values may not be correct. For example, the input may be a string when it should be an integer, or the output may be an integer when it should be a string.

To avoid this problem, you should check the data type of the input and output values before you start processing them. You can do this by using the `type()` function to get the data type of a value.

### 4. Off-by-one errors

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when you forget to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to incorrect results.

To avoid this problem, you should be careful to increment and decrement variables correctly. You can do this by using the `+=` and `-=` operators.

### 5. Logical errors

Logical errors are a type of bug that occurs when you make a mistake in your logic. This can lead to incorrect results.

To avoid this problem, you should carefully check your logic before you start implementing your code. You can do this by writing out the steps of your algorithm in English, or by using a debugger to step through your code.

Title:
HACKEREARTH aaryan-subsequences-and-great-xor

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input data is an array of integers. However, if the developer uses a data type that is too small to store the integers, it will cause an overflow error. For example, if the developer uses a `char` array to store the integers, it will only be able to store integers up to 255. This will cause an overflow error if any of the integers in the input data are greater than 255.

**2. Using incorrect algorithms**

There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. However, not all of these algorithms are efficient. For example, a naive algorithm that simply iterates through all of the possible subsequences and computes the XOR of each subsequence would be very inefficient. A more efficient algorithm would use a bitmask to represent the different subsequences.

**3. Incorrect implementation**

Even if the developer uses the correct data types and algorithms, they still need to implement the solution correctly. This means that they need to make sure that the code is free of bugs. For example, the developer needs to make sure that they check for edge cases and that they handle errors correctly.

**4. Missing corner cases**

When solving a problem, it is important to consider all of the possible corner cases. For example, the developer needs to make sure that they handle the case where the input data is empty. They also need to handle the case where all of the integers in the input data are the same.

**5. Not using existing libraries**

There are a number of existing libraries that can be used to solve this problem. For example, the `<algorithm>` header in C++ contains a number of functions that can be used to compute the XOR of a set of integers. Using these libraries can save the developer a lot of time and effort.

Title:
HACKEREARTH cs-16-monmurder-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement is not very clear, and it is easy to make mistakes in understanding it. For example, it is not clear what is meant by "the number of bullets the shooter fires is a factor of the receiver's health". Does this mean that the number of bullets must be a divisor of the receiver's health, or does it mean that the number of bullets must be a multiple of the receiver's health? Another potential source of confusion is the fact that the problem statement says that "Printf{} is really fast and hence he is the first to fire", but it does not say what happens if Pappu Bhujia is also fast and fires at the same time as Printf{}.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** Even if the problem statement is understood correctly, it is still possible to make mistakes in implementing the solution. For example, it is easy to make a mistake in the calculation of the number of bullets that Printf{} and Pappu Bhujia should fire. Another potential source of error is the fact that the problem statement does not specify how to handle the case where the receiver's health is not a multiple of the number of bullets that Printf{} or Pappu Bhujia fires.
3. **Incorrect testing of the solution.** It is important to test the solution thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. This can be done by testing the solution on a variety of different inputs, and by checking the output of the solution carefully. It is also important to test the solution for robustness, to make sure that it does not crash or produce incorrect results in the event of unexpected input.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **The developer might incorrectly assume that the number of bullets that Printf{} and Pappu Bhujia fire must be a divisor of the receiver's health.** This would result in the developer incorrectly calculating the number of bullets that each player should fire.
* **The developer might incorrectly assume that Printf{} always fires first.** This would result in the developer incorrectly calculating the number of bullets that each player should fire.
* **The developer might incorrectly handle the case where the receiver's health is not a multiple of the number of bullets that Printf{} or Pappu Bhujia fires.** This could result in the developer incorrectly calculating the number of bullets that each player should fire, or in the developer crashing the program.
* **The developer might incorrectly test the solution.** This could result in the developer missing bugs in the solution, or in the developer incorrectly believing that the solution is correct.

By being aware of these potential problems and bugs, developers can avoid them and write correct and efficient solutions to this problem.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect variable type**

The input specifies that the number of cities is an integer, but the code tries to read it as a string. This will cause a ValueError.

**2. Incorrect variable initialization**

The code initializes the variable `min_cost` to 0, but this is incorrect because the minimum cost could be negative.

**3. Incorrect comparison operator**

The code uses the `>` operator to compare the values of `min_cost` and `cost`, but this is incorrect because `min_cost` is a floating-point number and `cost` is an integer.

**4. Missing parentheses**

The code uses the `min()` function to find the minimum value of `min_cost` and `cost`, but it does not include parentheses around the arguments to the function. This will cause a SyntaxError.

**5. Off-by-one error**

The code iterates over the list of cities one element too many, which causes it to miss the last city. This will result in an incorrect answer.

Title:
HACKEREARTH special-knight

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of modulo operator**. The modulo operator (%) is used to find the remainder of a division. For example, 10 % 3 = 1, because 10 / 3 has a remainder of 1. However, some developers mistakenly use the modulo operator to check if a number is divisible by another number. For example, the following code will always return True:

```
if n % m == 0:
  # Do something
```

This is because the modulo operator will always return 0 if n is divisible by m. To check if a number is divisible by another number, you should use the `==` operator. For example:

```
if n == m * k:
  # Do something
```

2. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a developer forgets to add or subtract 1 from a calculation. For example, the following code will print the wrong answer for the sum of the first 100 numbers:

```
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 101):
  sum += i
print(sum)
```

The correct answer is 5050, but this code will print 5049. The problem is that the loop iterates from 1 to 100, but the sum variable is initialized to 0. This means that the first iteration of the loop will add 1 to the sum variable, but the second iteration will add 2, and so on. By the time the loop finishes, the sum variable will be 1 less than the correct answer.

3. **Incorrect use of pointers**. Pointers are a powerful tool that can be used to access data in memory. However, they can also be a source of errors if they are not used correctly. One common error is to dereference a pointer that is not pointing to a valid memory address. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect results. For example, the following code will crash the program:

```
int *ptr = NULL;
*ptr = 10;
```

The problem is that the pointer `ptr` is not pointing to any valid memory address. When the program tries to dereference `ptr`, it will cause a segmentation fault.

4. **Incorrect use of arrays**. Arrays are a data structure that can be used to store a collection of data items of the same type. However, they can also be a source of errors if they are not used correctly. One common error is to access an array element that is out of bounds. This can cause the program to crash or to produce incorrect results. For example, the following code will crash the program:

```
int arr[10];
arr[11] = 10;
```

The problem is that the array `arr` has only 10 elements, but the code tries to access the 11th element. This will cause the program to crash.

5. **Incorrect use of functions**. Functions are a powerful tool that can be used to group together related code. However, they can also be a source of errors if they are not used correctly. One common error is to pass the wrong arguments to a function. This can cause the function to produce incorrect results or to crash the program. For example, the following code will crash the program:

```
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}

int main() {
  int x = add(10, "hello");
}
```

The problem is that the function `add` expects two integer arguments, but the code passes a string as the second argument. This will cause the function to crash.

Title:
HACKEREARTH trace-of-a-matrix-36

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly calculating the trace.** The trace of a matrix is the sum of the elements on the main diagonal, so it is important to make sure that you are correctly identifying the elements that belong on the main diagonal and adding them together.
2. **Using the wrong order of operations.** When adding two matrices, it is important to remember that the order of operations matters. You should first add the elements of the first matrix to the corresponding elements of the second matrix, and then add the results together.
3. **Using incorrect data types.** The elements of a matrix can be of any data type, but it is important to make sure that you are using the correct data type for the operations that you are performing. For example, if you are adding two matrices of integers, you should use the `int` data type for the results.
4. **Invalid input.** The input for this problem consists of two integers, which represent the number of rows and columns in the matrices. It is important to make sure that these integers are valid. For example, you cannot have a matrix with negative rows or columns.
5. **Off-by-one errors.** When adding two matrices, it is easy to make a mistake and add the elements of one matrix to the wrong row or column of the other matrix. This can result in an incorrect answer.
6. **Memory errors.** If you are not careful, you can easily run out of memory when solving this problem. This is especially true if you are working with large matrices. To avoid this problem, you should make sure to free up memory as soon as you no longer need it.
7. **Floating-point errors.** When working with floating-point numbers, it is important to be aware of the possibility of rounding errors. These errors can occur when you are performing arithmetic operations on floating-point numbers, and they can lead to incorrect results. To avoid this problem, you should use the `round()` function to round your results to the desired number of decimal places.
8. **Infinite loops.** If you are not careful, you can easily create an infinite loop when solving this problem. This is especially true if you are using a recursive algorithm. To avoid this problem, you should make sure that your algorithm terminates after a finite number of steps.
9. **Stack overflows.** If you are not careful, you can easily cause a stack overflow when solving this problem. This is especially true if you are using a recursive algorithm. To avoid this problem, you should make sure that your algorithm does not exceed the stack size.
10. **Other errors.** There are many other possible errors that you could encounter when solving this problem. These errors could be caused by a variety of factors, such as incorrect code, incorrect data, or hardware problems. To avoid these errors, you should carefully review your code and test it thoroughly before submitting it.

Title:
ATCODER p02833 AtCoder Beginner Contest 148 - Double Factorial

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong formula**

The formula for double factorial is given in the problem statement. However, some developers may accidentally use the following formula instead:

```
f(n) = (n + 1)! / n!
```

This formula is incorrect, as it will not always produce the correct number of trailing zeros. For example, if n is even, the correct formula will produce 1 trailing zero, while the incorrect formula will produce 0 trailing zeros.

**2. Not handling negative numbers correctly**

The problem statement states that N must be non-negative. However, some developers may accidentally try to solve the problem for negative numbers. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**3. Not handling large numbers correctly**

The problem statement states that N can be up to 10^18. This is a very large number, and some developers may not be able to handle it correctly. For example, they may accidentally overflow a data type or they may not be able to store the number in memory.

**4. Not using the most efficient algorithm**

The most efficient algorithm for computing double factorial is the following:

```
def double_factorial(n):
  if n < 2:
    return 1
  else:
    return n * double_factorial(n - 2)
```

This algorithm is O(n) time and O(1) space. However, some developers may accidentally use a less efficient algorithm, such as the following:

```
def double_factorial(n):
  result = 1
  for i in range(2, n + 1):
    result *= i
  return result
```

This algorithm is O(n^2) time and O(n) space.

**5. Not handling special cases correctly**

The problem statement states that N can be equal to 0 or 1. Some developers may not handle these special cases correctly. For example, they may accidentally return 0 for N = 0 or 1.

Here are the most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrectly handling input data.** The input data may be invalid or incomplete, and the developer must be careful to handle these cases correctly. For example, the input data may contain negative numbers, which are not valid page numbers. The developer must check the input data for validity and raise an error if it is invalid.
2. **Incorrectly generating the abbreviated notation.** The abbreviated notation must be generated correctly according to the problem constraints. For example, the notation must not contain duplicate page numbers, and it must not contain spaces between page numbers. The developer must be careful to generate the abbreviated notation correctly.
3. **Incorrectly handling multiple datasets.** The input data may contain multiple datasets, and the developer must be careful to handle each dataset correctly. For example, the developer must not output the abbreviated notation for a dataset if the number of pages is 0. The developer must also be careful to output a newline character after each dataset.

By following these tips, developers can avoid common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

AIZU p00780 Goldbach's Conjecture

Pain points:
* **Incorrect implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes**. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple but efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given integer. However, it is important to implement the algorithm correctly, as a bug in the implementation can lead to incorrect results.
* **Incorrect handling of negative numbers**. The problem statement specifies that the input numbers are all even and greater than or equal to 4. However, a developer might accidentally write code that accepts negative numbers as input. This would lead to incorrect results, as negative numbers cannot be prime.
* **Incorrect handling of the end of input**. The problem statement specifies that the end of input is indicated by a number 0. However, a developer might accidentally write code that does not check for the end of input. This would lead to an infinite loop, as the program would continue to read input even after the end of input has been reached.
* **Incorrect handling of duplicates**. The problem statement specifies that the output should not count (p1, p2) and (p2, p1) separately as two different pairs. However, a developer might accidentally write code that does not check for duplicates. This would lead to incorrect results, as the program would count each pair twice.

By following these tips, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving the Goldbach's Conjecture problem.

AIZU p00913 Cubic Colonies

Pain points:
1. Possible bugs:
    * The input format is not well-defined. For example, it is not clear what happens if the input contains a space between two numbers.
    * The output format is not well-defined. For example, it is not clear how many digits to the right of the decimal point should be printed.
    * The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input contains invalid data. For example, what should happen if the input contains a negative number?
    * The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input contains a colony that is impossible to build. For example, what should happen if the input contains a colony that contains two blocks that are glued together in a way that makes it impossible to put a cable between them?
    * The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input contains a colony that is not connected. For example, what should happen if the input contains a colony that contains two blocks that are not connected by any path of blocks that are glued together?
    * The problem statement does not specify what to do if the input contains a colony that is not a cube. For example, what should happen if the input contains a colony that is a rectangular prism?
2. Possible problems:
    * The algorithm may be inefficient. For example, it may take a long time to run on large inputs.
    * The algorithm may not be correct. For example, it may output the wrong answer for some inputs.
    * The algorithm may not be robust. For example, it may crash or produce incorrect results if the input is invalid.
3. Possible solutions:
    * To avoid the first bug, the input format could be defined more precisely. For example, it could be specified that the input should not contain any spaces between two numbers.
    * To avoid the second bug, the output format could be defined more precisely. For example, it could be specified that the output should always have exactly three digits to the right of the decimal point.
    * To avoid the third bug, the problem statement could be modified to specify what to do if the input contains invalid data. For example, it could be specified that the program should output an error message and terminate if the input contains a negative number.
    * To avoid the fourth bug, the problem statement could be modified to specify what to do if the input contains a colony that is impossible to build. For example, it could be specified that the program should output an error message and terminate if the input contains a colony that contains two blocks that are glued together in a way that makes it impossible to put a cable between them.
    * To avoid the fifth bug, the problem statement could be modified to specify what to do if the input contains a colony that is not connected. For example, it could be specified that the program should output an error message and terminate if the input contains a colony that contains two blocks that are not connected by any path of blocks that are glued together.
    * To avoid the sixth bug, the problem statement could be modified to specify that the input should only contain colonies that are cubes. For example, it could be specified that the input should not contain any rectangular prisms.

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is specific, and if it is not followed, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input data. For example, if the number of crops is not specified on the first line, or if the crop information is not provided in the correct format, the program will not be able to process the data correctly.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format for this problem is also specific, and if it is not followed, the program will not be able to correctly print the output data. For example, if the crop names are not sorted in descending order of income efficiency, or if the names are not separated by newline characters, the output will not be correct.
* **Off-by-one errors:** When calculating the income efficiency of a crop, it is important to make sure that all of the relevant values are included. For example, the income efficiency should be calculated based on the total time from planting the seed to the completion of all of the fruits, not just the time from planting the seed to the first fruit.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic used to solve this problem is relatively straightforward, but it is important to make sure that all of the steps are correct. For example, it is important to make sure that the income efficiency is calculated correctly, and that the output is printed in the correct format.
* **Memory leaks:** When writing a program to solve a problem, it is important to make sure that you do not create any memory leaks. A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
* **Run-time errors:** When a program runs, it can encounter a variety of run-time errors. These errors can be caused by a number of factors, such as incorrect input data, incorrect logic, or memory leaks. It is important to be able to identify and fix run-time errors in order to ensure that your program runs correctly.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

AIZU p01483 Elevator

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible that the input will be in a different format than expected. This could lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of stops.** The number of stops required to reach all of the floors can be calculated in a variety of ways. If the wrong calculation is used, the program will produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement does not specify what to do in the case of an empty building or a building with only one floor. The program must be able to handle these cases correctly or it will produce incorrect output.
4. **Memory leaks.** The program must be careful not to allocate more memory than it needs. If too much memory is allocated, the program could crash or run out of memory.
5. **Synchronization issues.** If multiple threads are used to access the same data, it is important to ensure that the data is accessed in a consistent manner. If not, the program could produce incorrect output or crash.

Title:
AIZU p01796 JAG-channel II

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a two-line string, where the first line is an integer `N` (the number of characters in the string) and the second line is a string of length `N`. If the input format is incorrect, the developer may encounter a `SyntaxError` or `ValueError`.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single string of length `N`, where each character in the string is the first character of each line in the input string. If the output format is incorrect, the developer may encounter a `TypeError`.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over the input string, it is easy to make a mistake and iterate one character too far or not far enough. This can result in the output string being incorrect.
4. **Memory errors.** If the input string is very long, the developer may run out of memory when trying to iterate over it. This can be avoided by using a more efficient data structure, such as a list or a dictionary.
5. **Algorithmic complexity.** The naive algorithm for solving this problem has a time complexity of O(N^2), where `N` is the length of the input string. This can be improved to O(N) using a more efficient algorithm, such as a greedy algorithm.

Title:
AIZU p01930 Big Maze

Pain points:
No

## Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrectly identifying the start and end points of the maze.** The start point is the square that is located at the leftmost N point of Big Maze and is the passage, and the goal point is the square that is located at the rightmost N point and is the passage. It is important to make sure that you are correctly identifying these points, as they are essential for solving the problem.
2. **Not considering all possible rotations of the mazes.** Each maze can be rotated 90 degrees before joining the M mazes together. You need to make sure that you are considering all possible rotations, as this could affect the solution.
3. **Not connecting the mazes correctly.** The adjacent left and right sides of the mazes need to be connected in order to create a rectangular Big Maze. It is important to make sure that you are connecting the mazes correctly, as this could prevent you from finding a solution.
4. **Not finding a path from the start point to the goal point.** Even if you have correctly identified the start and end points of the maze and connected the mazes correctly, you still need to find a path from the start point to the goal point. This can be a difficult task, and there is no guarantee that a path always exists.
5. **Incorrectly implementing the solution.** Once you have found a path from the start point to the goal point, you need to implement the solution correctly. This involves writing code that will traverse the maze and find the path. It is important to make sure that your code is correct, as this could prevent you from finding a solution.

## How to avoid these problems and bugs

1. To avoid incorrectly identifying the start and end points of the maze, you should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand what is required. You should also draw a picture of the maze to help you visualize the problem.
2. To avoid not considering all possible rotations of the mazes, you should write a function that will generate all possible rotations of a maze. You can then use this function to generate all possible solutions to the problem.
3. To avoid not connecting the mazes correctly, you should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand how the mazes need to be connected. You should also draw a picture of the mazes to help you visualize the problem.
4. To avoid not finding a path from the start point to the goal point, you should use a search algorithm to find the path. There are many different search algorithms available, so you should choose one that is appropriate for the problem.
5. To avoid incorrectly implementing the solution, you should carefully write your code and test it thoroughly. You should also make sure that your code is efficient, as this will help you to solve the problem faster.

AIZU p02364 Minimum Spanning Tree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of Prim's algorithm.**

Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree in a weighted undirected graph. It works by iteratively adding edges to the tree, one at a time, such that the total weight of the edges in the tree is minimized.

A common mistake when implementing Prim's algorithm is to incorrectly update the set of vertices that have already been added to the tree. This can lead to the algorithm finding a non-minimum spanning tree.

**2. Using an incorrect data structure for the graph.**

Prim's algorithm requires a data structure that can efficiently represent the edges of the graph and the vertices that are adjacent to each vertex. A common mistake is to use an adjacency list data structure, which can be inefficient for graphs with a large number of edges.

A better data structure for Prim's algorithm is an adjacency matrix data structure, which can be more efficient for graphs with a large number of edges.

**3. Not handling degenerate cases correctly.**

There are a few degenerate cases that Prim's algorithm must handle correctly. For example, if the graph is empty, Prim's algorithm should return an empty tree. If the graph contains only one vertex, Prim's algorithm should return a tree with one edge.

**4. Using an incorrect termination condition.**

Prim's algorithm terminates when all of the vertices in the graph have been added to the tree. A common mistake is to terminate the algorithm early, before all of the vertices have been added to the tree. This can lead to the algorithm finding a non-minimum spanning tree.

**5. Not handling negative edge weights correctly.**

Prim's algorithm can be used to find a minimum spanning tree in a graph with negative edge weights. However, there are a few special considerations that must be made when handling negative edge weights. For example, if the graph contains a cycle of negative-weight edges, Prim's algorithm will not be able to find a minimum spanning tree.

**6. Not handling parallel edges correctly.**

Prim's algorithm can be used to find a minimum spanning tree in a graph with parallel edges. However, there are a few special considerations that must be made when handling parallel edges. For example, if the graph contains two parallel edges with the same weight, Prim's algorithm will only add one of the edges to the tree.

**7. Not handling self-loops correctly.**

Prim's algorithm can be used to find a minimum spanning tree in a graph with self-loops. However, there are a few special considerations that must be made when handling self-loops. For example, if the graph contains a self-loop with a negative weight, Prim's algorithm will not be able to find a minimum spanning tree.
