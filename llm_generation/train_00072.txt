Title:
CODECHEF gameaam

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very clear. It is not clear whether the number of test cases is given on the first line, or if each test case is on its own line. This can lead to errors in parsing the input and incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also not very clear. It is not clear whether the output should be a single line for each test case, or if the output should be on separate lines. This can also lead to errors in parsing the output and incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect logic**

The logic for solving this problem is not very straightforward. It is not clear how to determine whether the first player can win or not. This can lead to errors in the implementation of the solution and incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect data structures**

The data structures used to solve this problem are not very efficient. This can lead to slow runtimes and incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect algorithms**

Title:
CODECHEF lucky5

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be a single integer T, followed by T test cases. Each test case should be a single line containing a positive integer N.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer for each test case, representing the minimum number of operations needed to change N to a lucky number.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm should find the minimum number of operations needed to change N to a lucky number. A naive algorithm would check all possible combinations of operations, which would be very time-consuming. A more efficient algorithm would use a dynamic programming approach to find the minimum number of operations needed to change N to a lucky number.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. When performing calculations, it is important to be careful to avoid off-by-one errors. For example, if you are adding 1 to a number, make sure to check that the result does not overflow.
5. **Memory errors**. When working with large data sets, it is important to be careful not to run out of memory. One way to avoid this is to use a data structure that is appropriate for the size of the data set.
6. **Synchronization errors**. When working with multiple threads, it is important to be careful to synchronize access to shared data. Otherwise, you may get incorrect results.

Title:
CODECHEF tech07

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type:** The variable `n` should be an integer, but it may be a string or a float.
2. **Off-by-one error:** The formula for the number of triangles is `n * (n - 1) / 2`, but the developer may accidentally use `n * (n - 2) / 2`.
3. **Incorrect boundary check:** The developer may forget to check that `n` is less than or equal to 100.
4. **Incorrect algorithm:** The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to calculate the number of triangles. For example, they may try to count all possible combinations of three points, but this will overestimate the number of triangles.
5. **Incorrect output format:** The developer may not format the output correctly. For example, they may not use the correct number of digits after the decimal point.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1012_B. Chemical table

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains three integers n, m, and q. If we declare these variables as int, we may get wrong results when n or m is large. For example, if n = 200000 and m = 200000, then n * m = 400000000, which is larger than the maximum value of int (2147483647). To avoid this problem, we should declare these variables as long long.

**2. Using the wrong index**

In the problem statement, it is mentioned that "each element can be described by its coordinates (r, c) (1 ≤ r ≤ n, 1 ≤ c ≤ m) in the table". So the index of the first element in the first row is (1, 1). However, many people make the mistake of using (0, 0) as the index of the first element. This will lead to wrong results.

**3. Not considering the order of the elements**

In the problem statement, it is mentioned that "Innopolis University scientists already have samples of q elements. They want to obtain samples of all n·m elements. To achieve that, they will purchase some samples from other laboratories and then produce all remaining elements using an arbitrary number of nuclear fusions in some order". So the order of the elements that we have is important. If we do not consider the order of the elements, we may get wrong results.

**4. Not considering the fact that we can use the same element multiple times**

In the problem statement, it is mentioned that "Samples used in fusion are not wasted and can be used again in future fusions. Newly crafted elements also can be used in future fusions". So we can use the same element multiple times. If we do not consider this fact, we may get wrong results.

**5. Not considering the fact that we can produce multiple elements in one fusion**

In the problem statement, it is mentioned that "for every four different elements in this table that form a rectangle with sides parallel to the sides of the table, if they have samples of three of the four elements, they can produce a sample of the fourth element using nuclear fusion". So we can produce multiple elements in one fusion. If we do not consider this fact, we may get wrong results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1037_B. Reach Median

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly followed, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. For example, if the input is not in the correct format, the program may not be able to parse the input correctly and may produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input or output may be incorrect, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. For example, if the input is a string but the program expects an integer, the program may crash.
3. **Off-by-one error**. An off-by-one error occurs when a programmer miscounts by one, which may cause the program to produce incorrect results. For example, if a programmer is supposed to add 10 to a variable but accidentally adds 11, the program will produce an incorrect result.
4. **Logic error**. A logic error occurs when the program is logically incorrect, which may cause the program to produce incorrect results. For example, if a programmer is supposed to check if a variable is equal to 0 but accidentally checks if it is equal to 1, the program will produce an incorrect result.
5. **Memory leak**. A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but does not free it, which may eventually cause the program to crash. For example, if a programmer creates a new object but never deletes it, the program will eventually run out of memory and crash.
6. **Race condition**. A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same shared resource at the same time, which may cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash. For example, if two threads are both trying to update the same variable at the same time, the program may produce an incorrect value for the variable or crash.
7. **Deadlock**. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are each waiting for the other to release a resource, which prevents any of the threads from continuing execution. For example, if two threads are each waiting for the other to release a lock, neither thread will be able to continue execution and the program will eventually crash.
8. **Buffer overflow**. A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. For example, if a program writes 100 bytes of data to a buffer that can only hold 50 bytes, the program will crash.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a line with more than one item description, or a line with an incorrect number of fields.
2. **Incorrect data**. The input data may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers, numbers that are too large, or strings that do not match the expected format.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The solution may not be correct, even if the input format and data are correct. For example, the solution may not find the optimal equipment pattern, or it may not print the output in the correct format.
4. **Runtime errors**. The solution may run out of time or memory, even if the input format and data are correct and the logic is correct.
5. **Other bugs**. There may be other bugs in the solution that are not caused by the above problems. For example, the solution may not handle edge cases correctly, or it may have incorrect variable names or comments.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1081_D. Maximum Distance

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input may contain numbers that are too large for the data type you are using. This can lead to errors such as overflow or incorrect results.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating over a list or array, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one element or include one twice. This can lead to incorrect results or errors.
3. **Indexing errors**. When accessing elements of a list or array, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct index. An incorrect index can lead to errors such as accessing an element that does not exist or accessing an element that has already been overwritten.
4. **Memory leaks**. When you allocate memory for a variable, you need to make sure to free it when you are done with it. If you do not free the memory, it will eventually be lost and your program will crash.
5. **Race conditions**. When multiple threads are accessing the same data, it is important to make sure that the data is synchronized. If the data is not synchronized, it is possible for one thread to overwrite the data that another thread is currently using. This can lead to errors such as data corruption or incorrect results.
6. **Deadlocks**. When multiple threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, it is possible for a deadlock to occur. A deadlock occurs when each thread is waiting for the other thread to release the lock, and neither thread can continue. This can cause your program to hang indefinitely.
7. **Buffer overflows**. When you write data to a buffer, it is important to make sure that you do not write more data than the buffer can hold. A buffer overflow occurs when you write more data than the buffer can hold, and the extra data overwrites other data in memory. This can lead to errors such as data corruption or incorrect results.
8. **Format string vulnerabilities**. When you use a format string, it is important to make sure that you escape all special characters. If you do not escape the special characters, it is possible for an attacker to inject their own code into your program. This can lead to a security vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker to gain control of your system.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1129_A2. Toy Train

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect data type
The input data is a list of integers, but the code may incorrectly parse it as a list of strings. This can lead to errors when trying to perform arithmetic operations on the data.

### 2. Off-by-one errors
When iterating over the list of candies, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one candy or count one candy twice. This can lead to incorrect results.

### 3. Undefined behavior
The code may not be well-defined in all cases. For example, what happens if the train starts at a station that does not have any candies? Or what happens if there are no candies in the network? The code should handle these cases gracefully.

### 4. Memory leaks
The code may not properly free up memory that is no longer needed. This can lead to memory problems and eventually a crash.

### 5. Security vulnerabilities
The code may not be secure. For example, it may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system or access sensitive data.

### 6. Performance problems
The code may be inefficient. This can lead to slow execution times or even a denial-of-service attack.

### 7. Incorrect algorithm

Title:
CODEFORCES 1170_B. Bad Days

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program's output. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values may not be correctly specified, which can lead to errors in the program's output. For example, if the input values are specified as strings, the program may not be able to correctly interpret them as integers.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the program's logic is incorrect by one unit. For example, if the program is supposed to count the number of days that are bad, but it counts one day too many or one day too few, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Boundary errors**. Boundary errors occur when the program's logic does not handle the edge cases correctly. For example, if the program is supposed to count the number of days that are bad, but it does not handle the case where there are no days that are bad, the output will be incorrect.
5. **Memory errors**. Memory errors occur when the program allocates too much or too little memory, which can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
6. **Synchronization errors**. Synchronization errors occur when multiple threads access the same data at the same time, which can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
7. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads compete to access the same data, which can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
8. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, which can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.
9. **Anomalies**. Anomalies are unexpected and unpredictable errors that can occur in any program. They are often difficult to debug and can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.

CODEFORCES 1189_A. Keanu Reeves

Pain points:
1. The input string may contain only 0s and 1s.
2. The output should contain a single integer k, which is the number of substrings the input string is cut into.
3. Each substring in the output should be a good string.
4. The concatenation of all the substrings in the output should be equal to the input string.
5. The output should be formatted as follows:
```

Title:
CODEFORCES 1208_A. XORinacci

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the XOR operation.** The XOR operation is a binary operation that takes two bits as operands and returns a third bit that is 1 if exactly one of the operands is 1, and 0 otherwise. In Python, the XOR operation can be performed using the `^` operator. For example, `a ^ b` will return the XOR of the bits in `a` and `b`.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the Fibonacci numbers.** The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers. In Python, the Fibonacci numbers can be calculated using the following recursive function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
  if n == 0:
    return 0
  elif n == 1:
    return 1
  else:
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```

3. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (`%`) returns the remainder of a division operation. In Python, the modulo operator can be used to check if a number is divisible by another number. For example, `n % 2 == 0` will return True if `n` is divisible by 2.
4. **Incorrect use of the range function.** The range function in Python returns a sequence of numbers from a starting value to an ending value. The ending value is not included in the sequence. For example, `range(0, 10)` will return the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
5. **Incorrect use of the input function.** The input function in Python reads a line of input from the user. The input function can be used to read a number, a string, or a list of values. For example, the following code will read a number from the user and print it to the console:

```python
num = int(input())
print(num)

4. **Incorrect data**. The data used to test the solution may be incorrect. For example, the data may contain values that are outside of the specified ranges, or it may contain duplicate values.
5. **Incorrect implementation**. The solution may be incorrectly implemented. For example, the solution may contain syntax errors, or it may not use the correct data structures or algorithms.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the solution thoroughly with a variety of different data sets.

def main():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))

if __name__ == "__main__":

```

### Possible Problems

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem is not correctly parsed, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is `4 3
0 0 2 1
2 0 1 1`, the program will incorrectly parse the input as `4 3
0 0 2 1
2 0 1 1`, which will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem is not correctly formatted, which could lead to the program being marked incorrect. For example, if the program outputs `1`, the program will be marked incorrect because the correct output is `0`.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve the problem is incorrect, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, the following algorithm is incorrect:

```
def main():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))

    ans = float("inf")
    for i in range(n):
        diff = b[i] - a[i]
        if diff in d:
            ans = min(ans, min(d[diff]) - b[i])

    print(ans)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This algorithm will incorrectly find the smallest possible `x` such that `(a_i + x) mod m = b_i` for all `1 <= i <= n`, even if there is no such `x`.
4. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of a variable is not correctly specified, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, if the variable `ans` is declared as an integer, but the value of `ans` is actually a floating-point number, the program will incorrectly round `ans` to the nearest integer, which could lead to incorrect results.
5. **Off-by-one error**. An off-by-one error occurs when a programmer accidentally writes an incorrect code that results in the program output being one off from the correct output. For example, if the program is supposed to output `0`, but the program outputs `1`, the program has an off-by-one error.
6. **Index out of bounds error**. An index out of bounds error occurs when a programmer attempts to access an element of an array that is outside of the bounds of the array. For example, if the program attempts to access the element `a[n]`, where `n` is the size of the array, the program will generate an index out of bounds error.
7. **KeyError**. A KeyError occurs when a programmer attempts to access a key in a dictionary that does not exist. For example, if the program attempts to access the key `"b[i]"` in the dictionary `d`, where `b[i]` does not exist, the program will generate a KeyError.
8. **ValueError**. A ValueError occurs when a programmer attempts to perform an operation on a value that is invalid. For example, if the program attempts to divide a number by zero, the program will generate a ValueError.
9. **TypeError**. A TypeError occurs when a programmer attempts to perform an operation on two values of different data types. For example, if the program attempts to add an integer to a string, the program will generate a TypeError.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1334_A. Level Statistics

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type.** The problem statement specifies that `p_i` and `c_i` are integers, but the solution code uses `float`s. This will cause the program to produce incorrect results.
2. **Off-by-one error.** The solution code incorrectly checks if `c_i` is less than `p_i`. This is incorrect because `c_i` should be less than or equal to `p_i`.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The solution code incorrectly checks if `c_i` is less than `c_(i-1)`. This is incorrect because `c_i` could be equal to `c_(i-1)`.
4. **Missing boundary check.** The solution code does not check if `n` is less than or equal to 0. This could cause the program to crash.
5. **Incorrect indentation.** The solution code is not correctly indented, which makes it difficult to read and understand.
6. **Use of global variables.** The solution code uses global variables, which can make it difficult to track the state of the program.
7. **Unnecessary code.** The solution code contains unnecessary code, which can make it slower and more difficult to maintain.
8. **Inefficient algorithm.** The solution code uses an inefficient algorithm, which can make it slow.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that your code is correct. You should also use a debugger to check your code and find any errors.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1354_C2. Not So Simple Polygon Embedding

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong formula**

The formula for the side length of a square that can contain a regular polygon with n sides is ```
s = 2 * sin(π / n)
```

However, this formula is only valid for even values of n. For odd values of n, the correct formula is

```
s = 2 * sin(π / (2n - 1))
```

**2. Not considering the possibility that the polygon may not be able to fit in a square**

The formula for the side length of a square that can contain a regular polygon with n sides assumes that the polygon can be inscribed in a square. However, this is not always the case. For example, a regular pentagon cannot be inscribed in a square.

If the polygon cannot be inscribed in a square, the output should be ```-1```.

**3. Using an incorrect programming language**

The problem is asking for a solution in C++, but you may have submitted your solution in a different language. This will result in a compilation error.

**4. Making a mistake in your code**

This is the most common cause of bugs. Make sure to carefully check your code for errors before submitting it.

**5. Not following the problem statement**

The problem statement is very specific, and you must follow it exactly. For example, the problem states that the output should be a real number, but you may have accidentally output an integer. This will result in a wrong answer.

**6. Submitting your solution too late**

The contest is over, so you can no longer submit your solution.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1374_B. Multiply by 2, divide by 6

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specified in the problem statement is "The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow. 

The only line of the test case contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).". However, a developer may accidentally input a different format, such as "1
2". This would cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specified in the problem statement is "For each test case, print the answer — the minimum number of moves needed to obtain 1 from n if it's possible to do that or -1 if it's impossible to obtain 1 from n.". However, a developer may accidentally output a different format, such as "1 2". This would cause the program to receive a wrong answer.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic used to solve the problem is incorrect. For example, a developer may incorrectly assume that the number of moves needed to reach 1 is always equal to the number of times the number can be divided by 6. This would cause the program to give an incorrect answer for some test cases.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. A developer may accidentally make an off-by-one error when counting the number of moves needed to reach 1. For example, a developer may count the number of times the number can be divided by 6 as one less than the actual number. This would cause the program to give an incorrect answer for some test cases.
5. **Memory leaks**. A developer may accidentally create a memory leak in their program. This could cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
6. **Race conditions**. A developer may accidentally create a race condition in their program. This could cause the program to produce incorrect results.
7. **Deadlocks**. A developer may accidentally create a deadlock in their program. This could cause the program to hang indefinitely.
8. **Unhandled exceptions**. A developer may accidentally leave unhandled exceptions in their program. This could cause the program to crash.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1439_C. Greedy Shopping

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is two integers n and q, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The integers n and q should be positive and less than 2 * 10^5. The integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n should be non-negative and less than 10^9. However, a developer may accidentally mistype the input format, or the input data may be corrupted. This can lead to incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer for each query of type 2. The integer should be the number of meals that the hungry man will purchase. However, a developer may accidentally mistype the output format, or the output may be corrupted. This can lead to incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm**

The greedy algorithm for this problem works by iteratively updating the array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n so that it is always non-increasing. The algorithm then finds the maximum number of meals that the hungry man can purchase, given his budget y. However, a developer may implement the greedy algorithm incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect handling of overflow**

The integers n, q, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and y may be very large. This means that a developer must be careful to avoid overflow errors when performing arithmetic operations on these integers.

**5. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

The problem statement specifies several edge cases that must be handled correctly. For example, the problem statement specifies that there must be at least one query of type 2. A developer who does not handle this edge case correctly will get incorrect results.

**6. Incorrect use of dynamic programming**

The problem can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming. However, a developer who does not use dynamic programming correctly will get incorrect results.

CODEFORCES 1466_C. Canine poetry

Pain points:
1. The input format is not specified. Is it a single string? A list of strings? A list of integers?
2. The output format is not specified. Is it a single integer? A list of integers?
3. The problem statement is not clear. What does "substring" mean? What does "palindrome" mean? What does "length greater than 1" mean?
4. The example is not clear. What does "replace the third character with c" mean? What does "obtain a palindrome-less poem bacba" mean?
5. The code is not correct. It does not pass all the test cases.

Here are some possible solutions to these problems:

1. The input format can be specified as follows:
```
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    poem = input()
```
2. The output format can be specified as follows:
```
for i in range(t):
    print(ans)
```
3. The problem statement can be clarified as follows:

A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards and forwards. For example, "abba" is a palindrome, but "abc" is not.

A substring of a string is a part of the string that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly zero or all) characters from the beginning and some (possibly zero or all) characters from the end. For example, "ba" is a substring of "abba".

The length of a string is the number of characters in the string. For example, the length of "abba" is 3.

4. The example can be clarified as follows:

In the first test case, the string "babba" contains two palindromes: "bab" and "ba". To make the string "babba" palindrome-free, we can replace the third character with "c" to obtain the string "bacba".

5. The code can be corrected as follows:

```
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def solve(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if is_palindrome(s[i:j]):
                ans += 1
    return ans

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    s = input()

Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is not very clear, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading in the data. For example, if you forget to include the space between the number of test cases and the first test case, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input.
* **Incorrect output format.** The output format for this problem is also not very clear, and it is easy to make a mistake when writing the output. For example, if you forget to put a space between the numbers in the output, the program will not be able to correctly format the output.
* **Incorrect data type.** The data type for the input and output of this problem is not very clear, and it is easy to make a mistake when converting between data types. For example, if you try to convert a string to an integer, the program will not be able to correctly process the data.
* **Incorrect logic.** The logic for solving this problem is not very straightforward, and it is easy to make a mistake when implementing the solution. For example, if you forget to update the depth of a node when you add it to the stack, the program will not be able to correctly calculate the depths of all of the nodes in the tree.
* **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of mistake that can occur when programming. In this problem, it is easy to make an off-by-one error when calculating the depth of a node in the tree. For example, if you forget to subtract 1 from the index of the node when calculating its depth, the program will not be able to correctly calculate the depth of the node.

By carefully following the instructions and avoiding the common pitfalls listed above, you can successfully solve this problem.

CODEFORCES 283_D. Cows and Cool Sequences

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input specifies that the integers are positive and less than 1015. However, the %lld specifier is used to read and write 64-bit integers. This can lead to errors if the integers are actually smaller than 64 bits.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The problem states that the sequence is cool if the pairs (a1, a2), (a2, a3), ..., (an - 1, an) are all cool. However, the algorithm below only checks if the pairs (a1, a2) and (an - 1, an) are cool. This means that it will not find the optimal solution in all cases.

```
def is_cool(a1, a2):
  for i in range(1, a2 - a1 + 1):
    if a1 + i != a2:
      return False
  return True

def solve(n, a):
  if is_cool(a[0], a[1]) and is_cool(a[n - 2], a[n - 1]):
    return 0
  else:
    return 1
```

**3. Incorrect input handling**

The problem states that the first line contains a single integer, n. However, the code below does not check if the input is valid. This can lead to errors if the input is not a single integer.

```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

**4. Off-by-one errors**

The problem states that the sequence is cool if the pairs (a1, a2), (a2, a3), ..., (an - 1, an) are all cool. However, the code below checks if the pairs (a1, a2), (a2, a3), ..., (an, an + 1) are all cool. This means that it will not find the optimal solution in all cases.

```

CODEFORCES 354_B. Game with Strings

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible to encounter inputs that are not in the expected format. For example, the input `1` would be interpreted as a 1x1 table, but it is actually a single integer. To avoid this problem, you should always check the input format before processing it.

### 2. Incorrect output format

The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is possible to encounter outputs that are not in the expected format. For example, the output `FIRST` would be interpreted as the first player winning, but it is actually the string `FIRST`. To avoid this problem, you should always check the output format before printing it.

### 3. Off-by-one errors

When iterating over a list or array, it is easy to make an off-by-one error and miss a value or include an extra value. This can lead to incorrect results. To avoid this problem, you should always check the bounds of your iterators before accessing values.

### 4. Indexing errors

When indexing into a list or array, it is easy to make an indexing error and access a value that is out of bounds. This can lead to incorrect results or even a runtime error. To avoid this problem, you should always check the bounds of your indexes before accessing values.

### 5. Logical errors

When writing code, it is easy to make logical errors that cause the code to behave incorrectly. For example, you might accidentally compare two values using the wrong operator or use the wrong variable. To avoid this problem, you should always carefully review your code before running it.

### 6. Undefined behavior

When writing code, it is possible to create undefined behavior by doing something that the compiler or interpreter does not know how to handle. This can lead to incorrect results or even a runtime error. To avoid this problem, you should always make sure that your code is well-defined.

### 7. Memory leaks

When writing code, it is possible to create memory leaks by allocating memory that is never freed. This can lead to a slow down in performance or even a system crash. To avoid this problem, you should always free memory that you allocate.

### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format of the problem is not strictly defined. For example, the input `5 10` is valid, but the input `5 10 1` is not. The developer should make sure that the input is correctly formatted.

### 2. Undefined behavior

The problem does not specify what happens if the number of swaps exceeds k. The developer should define what happens in this case. For example, the developer could choose to ignore the extra swaps or to return an error.

### 3. Off-by-one errors

The developer should be careful to avoid off-by-one errors when counting the number of swaps or when computing the maximum value of m(a).

### 4. Incorrect algorithm

The developer should make sure that the algorithm used to solve the problem is correct. For example, the developer should not assume that the array a is sorted.

### 5. Memory leaks

The developer should make sure that the program does not leak memory. For example, the developer should free any dynamically allocated memory when it is no longer needed.

### 6. Race conditions

The developer should make sure that the program does not suffer from race conditions. For example, the developer should not access shared data from multiple threads without synchronization.

Title:
CODEFORCES 449_D. Jzzhu and Numbers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the bitwise AND operator.** The bitwise AND operator (`&`) takes two operands and returns a third operand that is the result of the bitwise AND operation of the first two operands. For example, if `a` and `b` are two integers, then `a & b` is the integer that results from performing the bitwise AND operation on `a` and `b`.
2. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (`%`) takes two operands and returns a third operand that is the remainder of the first operand divided by the second operand. For example, if `a` and `b` are two integers, then `a % b` is the integer that results from dividing `a` by `b` and taking the remainder.
3. **Incorrect use of the factorial function.** The factorial function (`!`) takes an integer as its argument and returns the product of all the integers from 1 to the argument. For example, `5!` is equal to `1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5`.
4. **Incorrect use of the binomial coefficient.** The binomial coefficient (`nCk`) takes two integers as its arguments and returns the number of ways to choose `k` objects from a set of `n` objects. For example, `5C2` is equal to `5! / (2! * 3!)`.
5. **Incorrect use of the Stirling number of the second kind.** The Stirling number of the second kind (`S(n, k)` takes two integers as its arguments and returns the number of ways to partition a set of `n` elements into `k` non-empty subsets. For example, `S(5, 2)` is equal to `5! / (2! * 3!)`.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a single line containing an expression a?b, where a and b are integers between 1 and 999, inclusive; ? is an operation character. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the expression and will output an incorrect result.
2. **Incorrect operator.** The operators that can be used in the expression are '+', '-', '*', '/', and '%'. If an invalid operator is used, the program will not be able to correctly evaluate the expression and will output an incorrect result.
3. **Integer overflow.** The operands of the expression can be integers between 1 and 999, inclusive. If an operand is greater than 999, the program will not be able to correctly evaluate the expression and will output an incorrect result.
4. **Division by zero.** The expression cannot contain a division by zero. If the expression contains a division by zero, the program will not be able to correctly evaluate the expression and will output an incorrect result.
5. **Modulo by zero.** The expression cannot contain a modulo by zero. If the expression contains a modulo by zero, the program will not be able to correctly evaluate the expression and will output an incorrect result.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input format, the operators used in the expression, and the operands of the expression. The developer should also make sure that the expression does not contain any division by zero or modulo by zero operations.

            count_hash += 1
    return -1 if count_left != count_right else count_hash

print(solve('(((#)((#)'))
```

2. **Incorrect handling of the '#' characters.** The problem statement states that the goal is to replace each '#' with one or more ')' characters so that the final string becomes beautiful. However, a solution that does not correctly handle the '#' characters will not produce the correct output. For example, the following solution will not produce the correct output for the input string `'(((#)((#)'`:

```
def solve(s):
    count_left, count_right, count_hash = (0, 0, 0)
    for c in s:
        if c == '(':
            count_left += 1
        elif c == ')':
            count_right += 1
        else:
            count_hash += 1
    if count_left != count_right:
        return -1
    return count_hash

print(solve('(((#)((#)'))
```

3. **Incorrect use of the `range()` function.** The problem statement states that the input string contains at least one '#' character. However, a solution that incorrectly uses the `range()` function will not consider the '#' characters when iterating over the string. For example, the following solution will not consider the '#' characters when iterating over the string `'(((#)((#)'`:

```
def solve(s):
    count_left, count_right, count_hash = (0, 0, 0)
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            count_left += 1
        elif s[i] == ')':
            count_right += 1
        else:
            count_hash += 1
    if count_left != count_right:
        return -1
    return count_hash

print(solve('(((#)((#)'))
```

4. **Incorrect handling of the output.** The problem statement states that the output should be a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of ')' characters that should be used to replace a '#' character. However, a solution that does not correctly format the output will not produce the correct output. For example, the following solution will not produce the correct output for the input string `'(((#)((#)'`:

```
def solve(s):
    count_left, count_right, count_hash = (0, 0, 0)
    for c in s:
        if c == '(':
            count_left += 1
        elif c == ')':
            count_right += 1
        else:
            count_hash += 1
    if count_left != count_right:
        return -1
    return [count_hash]

print(solve('(((#)((#)'))
```

5. **Incorrect use of the `return` statement.** The problem statement states that the output should be a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of ')' characters that should be used to replace a '#' character. However, a solution that incorrectly uses the `return` statement will not produce the correct output. For example, the following solution will not produce the correct output for the input string `'(((#)((#)'`:

```
def solve(s):
    count_left, count_right, count_hash = (0, 0, 0)
    for c in s:
        if c == '(':
            count_left += 1
        elif c == ')':
            count_right += 1
        else:
            count_hash += 1
    if count_left != count_right:

CODEFORCES 518_E. Arthur and Questions

Pain points:
1. The input format is not correct. For example, the input `3 2` is not correct because there is no space between `3` and `2`.
2. The input data is not valid. For example, the input `5 3` `4 6 7 2 9` is not valid because the sum of the first 3 elements is not strictly increasing.
3. The output format is not correct. For example, the output `Incorrect sequence` should be in all lower case.
4. The output is not correct. For example, the output `0 1 2` is not correct because the sum of the first 3 elements is not strictly increasing.
5. The code is not efficient. For example, the code below takes O(n^2) time to solve the problem, where n is the length of the input sequence.
```
def solve(n, k, a):
  # Check if the input format is correct.
  if len(a) != n:

CODEFORCES 544_E. Remembering Strings

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is given as two integers and n strings. The first integer n is the number of strings in the multiset. The second integer m is the length of the strings. The next n lines contain the strings of the multiset, each string's length is m. The next n lines contain m integers each, the i-th of them contains integers ai1, ai2, ..., aim (0 ≤ aij ≤ 106).

A common mistake is to incorrectly parse the input data. For example, you might accidentally parse the first integer n as a string, or you might accidentally parse the second integer m as a string. This will cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm for solving this problem is to first find the minimum cost of changing each string in the multiset so that it is easy to remember. Then, we need to find the minimum cost of changing all of the strings in the multiset so that they are all easy to remember. The minimum cost is the sum of the minimum costs of changing each string.

A common mistake is to use an incorrect algorithm for finding the minimum cost of changing each string in the multiset. For example, you might accidentally use a greedy algorithm that does not always find the optimal solution. This will cause the program to produce incorrect output.

**3. Incorrect implementation**

The implementation of the algorithm is also important. A common mistake is to make a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm. For example, you might accidentally use the wrong variable or you might accidentally mistype a line of code. This will cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**4. Incorrect testing**

It is important to test your program thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. A common mistake is to not test your program at all. This will likely cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output when it is used in production.

**5. Incorrect debugging**

If your program does not work correctly, it is important to be able to debug it. A common mistake is to not know how to debug a program. This will make it difficult to fix the problem and get the program working correctly.

Here are some tips for debugging a program:

* **Use a debugger.** A debugger can help you to track down the source of a bug by allowing you to step through the code line by line.
* **Print debugging statements.** Printing debugging statements can help you to see what is happening in your program.
* **Use a unit testing framework.** A unit testing framework can help you to test your code in isolation.
* **Ask for help.** If you are stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help from someone else.

CODEFORCES 571_B. Minimization

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in parsing the input data. For example, if the input contains a space after the first integer, the program may interpret the second integer as part of the first integer.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in displaying the output data. For example, if the output contains a newline character after the last integer, the program may not print the output correctly.
3. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. For example, if the algorithm assumes that the input data is always sorted, it may not work correctly for unsorted data.
4. **Incorrect data.** The data used to test the program may be incorrect. For example, if the data contains negative integers, the program may not work correctly.
5. **Incorrect implementation.** The program may be incorrectly implemented, which may lead to errors in the output data. For example, if the program uses a variable that is not initialized, the program may crash.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the program with a variety of input data, including incorrect data, to ensure that the program works correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 592_E. BCPC

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect implementation of the relation between reading and writing speed.** The relation between reading and writing speed is not transitive, as it often happens in real life. This means that a student who overwhelms another student does not necessarily mean that the other student overwhelms the first student. This can lead to incorrect results if the relation between reading and writing speed is not implemented correctly.
* **Incorrect implementation of the definition of a good team.** A good team is a team consisting of three distinct students i, j and k such that i overwhelms j, j overwhelms k, and k overwhelms i. This means that each student in the team must overwhelm at least one other student in the team. If this condition is not met, the team is not considered to be good.
* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm for finding the number of good teams.** The algorithm for finding the number of good teams is a recursive algorithm that takes as input the number of students in the team, the reading and writing speeds of each student, and the current state of the team. The algorithm then checks if the current team is good and, if it is, it increments the number of good teams by one. The algorithm then recursively calls itself on the remaining students to find all possible good teams. If the algorithm is not implemented correctly, it may not find all of the good teams or it may find duplicate teams.

**Additional tips:**

* When implementing the relation between reading and writing speed, it is important to remember that the relation is not transitive. This means that a student who overwhelms another student does not necessarily mean that the other student overwhelms the first student.
* When implementing the definition of a good team, it is important to remember that each student in the team must overwhelm at least one other student in the team. If this condition is not met, the team is not considered to be good.
* When implementing the algorithm for finding the number of good teams, it is important to make sure that the algorithm is recursive and that it takes as input the number of students in the team, the reading and writing speeds of each student, and the current state of the team. The algorithm should then check if the current team is good and, if it is, it should increment the number of good teams by one. The algorithm should then recursively call itself on the remaining students to find all possible good teams. If the algorithm is not implemented correctly, it may not find all of the good teams or it may find duplicate teams.

CODEFORCES 614_C. Peter and Snow Blower

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format handling**. The input format for this problem is a bit tricky, so it's important to make sure that you're handling it correctly. For example, you need to make sure that you're correctly parsing the number of vertices, the coordinates of the point P, and the coordinates of each of the vertices of the polygon.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the area of the cleared region**. The area of the cleared region is equal to the area of the original polygon minus the area of the intersection of the polygon and the circle centered at P. It's important to be careful when calculating these areas, as it's easy to make mistakes.
3. **Floating-point rounding errors**. When calculating the area of the cleared region, you'll need to use floating-point arithmetic. It's important to be aware of the potential for floating-point rounding errors, and to make sure that your answer is correct within the specified tolerance.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output for this problem should be a single real value number. It's important to make sure that you're formatting your output correctly, and that it's within the specified range.

Title:
CODEFORCES 633_H. Fibonacci-ish II

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of Fibonacci sequence**

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

```
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1
```

A common mistake is to implement the Fibonacci sequence as follows:

```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

This implementation is incorrect because it does not take into account the base cases. The correct implementation is as follows:

```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

**2. Using incorrect data types**

Another common mistake is to use incorrect data types when implementing the Fibonacci sequence. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(100))
```

This code will throw a `ValueError` because the result of `fibonacci(100)` will overflow the `int` data type. The correct way to implement this code is to use the `long` data type:

```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(100))
```

**3. Using incorrect modulo arithmetic**

When computing the Fibonacci-ish potential, it is important to use correct modulo arithmetic. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
def fibonacci_ish_potential(a, m):
    result = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        result += a[i] * fibonacci(i) % m
    return result % m

print(fibonacci_ish_potential([1, 2, 3], 10))
```

This code will throw a `ValueError` because the result of `fibonacci_ish_potential([1, 2, 3], 10)` will overflow the `int` data type. The correct way to implement this code is to use the `long` data type and to perform modulo arithmetic correctly:

```
def fibonacci_ish_potential(a, m):
    result = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        result += a[i] * fibonacci(i) % m
    return result % m

print(fibonacci_ish_potential([1, 2, 3], 10))
```

**4. Not handling boundary cases correctly**

Another common mistake is to not handle boundary cases correctly. For example, the following code will not work correctly:

```
def fibonacci_ish_potential(a, m):
    result = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        result += a[i] * fibonacci(i) % m
    return result % m

print(fibonacci_ish_potential([1, 2, 3], 0))
```

This code will throw a `ZeroDivisionError` because the Fibonacci sequence is undefined for `n < 0`. The correct way to implement this code is to handle the boundary case of `n < 0` correctly:

```
def fibonacci_ish_potential(a, m):
    if len(a) < 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be non-negative")
    result = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        result += a[i] * fibonacci(i) % m
    return

CODEFORCES 662_C. Binary Table

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not always strictly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may be separated by tabs instead of commas. The developer should make sure that the input is properly parsed and that no errors are thrown.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not always strictly followed. For example, the output may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may be separated by tabs instead of commas. The developer should make sure that the output is properly formatted and that no errors are thrown.

**3. Incorrect data type**

The input and output data may be of the wrong type. For example, the input may contain strings instead of integers, or the output may contain floats instead of integers. The developer should make sure that the data is properly converted to the correct type.

**4. Incorrect logic**

The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program. For example, the program may not correctly count the number of ones in the table, or it may not correctly apply the operations to the table. The developer should carefully test the program to make sure that it is correct.

**5. Runtime errors**

2. The input graph may not be a connected graph. In this case, it is impossible to find two disjoint vertex covers that cover all the edges in the graph.
3. The input graph may not have a vertex cover of size 2. In this case, it is impossible to find two disjoint vertex covers that each have size 2.
4. The input graph may have multiple vertex covers of size 2. In this case, there is no unique way to find two disjoint vertex covers that each have size 2.
5. The input graph may have a vertex cover of size 1. In this case, it is impossible to find two disjoint vertex covers that each have size 2.

CODEFORCES 709_E. Centroids

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the DFS algorithm.** The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that traverses a tree or graph in a depth-first order. It can be used to find the connected components of a graph, find the shortest path between two vertices, and find the maximum depth of a tree.

When implementing the DFS algorithm, it is important to make sure that the algorithm terminates correctly. One common mistake is to forget to check for a base case, which is a condition that terminates the recursion. Another common mistake is to make a mistake in the recursive call, which can cause the algorithm to enter an infinite loop.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the centroid decomposition algorithm.** The centroid decomposition algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that can be used to find the centroid of a tree. The algorithm works by recursively dividing the tree into smaller and smaller subtrees until each subtree contains a single vertex. The centroid of the tree is then the vertex that is contained in the largest subtree.

When implementing the centroid decomposition algorithm, it is important to make sure that the algorithm terminates correctly. One common mistake is to forget to check for a base case, which is a condition that terminates the recursion. Another common mistake is to make a mistake in the recursive call, which can cause the algorithm to enter an infinite loop.

**3. Incorrect handling of edge cases.** When solving a problem, it is important to make sure that the algorithm handles all possible edge cases. Some common edge cases to consider include:

* The input is empty.
* The input is invalid.
* The input is too large.
* The input is too small.

If the algorithm does not handle these edge cases correctly, it may produce incorrect results or crash.

**4. Incorrect use of data structures.** When solving a problem, it is important to choose the right data structures for the problem. The wrong data structures can make the algorithm inefficient or even impossible to implement.

Some common data structures to use for tree problems include:

* Adjacency lists
* Adjacency matrices
* Disjoint-set data structures

The choice of data structure will depend on the specific problem being solved.

**5. Incorrect use of algorithms.** When solving a problem, it is important to choose the right algorithm for the problem. The wrong algorithm can make the algorithm inefficient or even impossible to implement.

Some common algorithms to use for tree problems include:

* Breadth-first search
* Depth-first search
* Kruskal's algorithm
* Prim's algorithm

The choice of algorithm will depend on the specific problem being solved.

CODEFORCES 754_B. Ilya and tic-tac-toe game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format of the problem states that each line should contain four characters. However, if the input contains a line with fewer than four characters, or more than four characters, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format of the problem states that the output should be a single line that contains either "YES" or "NO". However, if the output contains anything other than these two strings, the program will be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program should be correct in order to determine whether Ilya could have won the game by making a single turn. For example, the program should check if there are three Xs in a row, column, or diagonal, and if so, it should output "YES". However, if the program does not check for this condition, it will output the incorrect answer.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the program does not account for the fact that the indices of arrays start at 0. For example, if the program is trying to access the third element of an array, but the array only has two elements, the program will crash.
5. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when the program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
6. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results or crashing.
7. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, and neither thread can ever release the lock. This can lead to the program running indefinitely or crashing.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can occur when the program does not properly validate user input. This can allow attackers to inject malicious code into the program, which can then be used to compromise the security of the system.
9. **Performance problems**. The program may run slowly if it is not properly optimized. This can be caused by a number of factors, such as inefficient algorithms, unnecessary memory allocations, or poor threading.

CODEFORCES 820_A. Mister B and Book Reading

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line should contain five space-separated integers. However, a developer may accidentally forget to include a space between two integers, or may include an extra space. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of days required to finish the book**. The program must calculate the number of days required to finish the book by taking into account the initial reading speed, the maximum reading speed, the acceleration in reading speed, and the number of pages for rereading. A developer may make a mistake in this calculation, resulting in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. The problem statement specifies several edge cases, such as when the book has only one page, or when the maximum reading speed is less than the initial reading speed. A developer must make sure to handle these edge cases correctly, or the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect use of variables**. The program must use variables in a consistent and logical way. A developer may accidentally use the wrong variable, or may use a variable for the wrong purpose. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
5. **Incorrect logic**. The program must be logically correct in order to produce the correct output. A developer may make a mistake in the logic of the program, resulting in an incorrect answer.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that they understand all of the requirements. They should also carefully test their code to make sure that it produces the correct output for all possible input values.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a number of tasks that is not between 1 and 45, or the time required to solve a subtask may be negative.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single integer, which is the maximum number of points that Polycarp can earn.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When calculating the maximum number of points that Polycarp can earn, it is important to make sure that you account for all of the possible ways to earn points. For example, if Polycarp has enough time to solve all of the subtasks of a task, you should not forget to add 1 to the total number of points.
4. **Incorrect time complexity**. The time complexity of your solution should be O(n * k), where n is the number of tasks and k is the number of subtasks per task.
5. **Memory leaks**. Your solution should not leak any memory.
6. **Incorrect use of resources**. Your solution should not use any resources that are not specified in the problem statement.
7. **Bugs in the logic of your solution**. Your solution should be correct and should not have any bugs.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand the input and output formats.
* Test your solution on a variety of input data to make sure that it works correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 914_F. Substrings in a String

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of substrings**

One common mistake is to incorrectly use substrings. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
def count_substrings(s, y):
  """Counts the number of occurrences of y in s."""
  count = 0
  for i in range(len(s) - len(y) + 1):
    if s[i:i + len(y)] == y:
      count += 1
  return count

```

This code would not work correctly because it does not take into account overlapping occurrences of y. For example, if s is "abcabc" and y is "abc", the code would count three occurrences of y, even though there are only two distinct occurrences.

To correctly count the number of occurrences of y in s, we need to use a sliding window. A sliding window is a contiguous subsequence of a string that is moved one character at a time. We can use a sliding window to count the number of occurrences of y in s by keeping track of the number of characters in s that match the first character of y. When the number of matching characters reaches the length of y, we increment the count of occurrences of y.

The following code correctly counts the number of occurrences of y in s:

```
def count_substrings(s, y):
  """Counts the number of occurrences of y in s."""
  count = 0
  window_start = 0
  for i in range(len(s)):
    if s[i] == y[0]:
      # Extend the sliding window until it matches y.
      while i < len(s) and s[i] == y[window_start]:
        window_start += 1

      # If the sliding window matches y, increment the count.
      if window_start == len(y):
        count += 1

      # Reset the sliding window.
      window_start = 0

  return count
```

**2. Incorrect use of hash tables**

Another common mistake is to incorrectly use hash tables. For example, the following code would not work correctly:

```
def count_substrings(s, y):
  """Counts the number of occurrences of y in s."""
  count = 0
  hash_table = {}
  for i in range(len(s)):
    if s[i] in hash_table:
      hash_table[s[i]] += 1
    else:
      hash_table[s[i]] = 1

  for i in range(len(s) - len(y) + 1):
    sub_string = s[i:i + len(y)]
    if sub_string in hash_table:
      count += hash_table[sub_string]

  return count
```

This code would not work correctly because it does not take into account overlapping occurrences of y. For example, if s is "abcabc" and y is "abc", the code would count three occurrences of y, even though there are only two distinct occurrences.

To correctly count the number of occurrences of y in s, we need to use a hash table that stores the number of occurrences of each character in y. We can then use this hash table to count the number of occurrences of y in s by keeping track of the number of characters in s that match each character in y.

The following code correctly counts the number of occurrences of y in s:

```
def count_substrings(s, y):
  """Counts the number of occurrences of y in s."""
  count = 0
  hash_table = {}
  for i in range(len(y)):
    if y[i] in hash_table:
      hash_table[y[i]] += 1
    else:
      hash_table[y[i]] = 1

  for i in range(len(s) - len(y) + 1):
    sub_string = s[i:i + len(y)]
    for j in range(len(y)):
      if sub_string[j] not in hash_table:
        break
      count += hash_table[sub_string[j]]

  return count
```

**3. Incorrect use of dynamic programming**

Another common mistake is to incorrectly use
Test inputs:
```
s = "ababababa"
q = 3
queries = [
    "2 1 7 aba",
    "1 5 c",
    "2 1 7 aba",
]
```
Title:
CODEFORCES 937_D. Sleepy Game

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the number of vertices and edges may be separated by a space instead of a comma, or the edges may be listed in a different order. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect data**

The data may be incorrect in various ways. For example, the number of vertices and edges may not be consistent, or the edges may not form a valid graph. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When iterating over the vertices or edges of the graph, it is easy to make an off-by-one error and skip a vertex or edge. This can lead to the program missing a valid path or cycle, or incorrectly identifying a vertex as being unreachable.

**4. Insufficient memory**

If the graph is too large, the program may not have enough memory to store all of the vertices and edges. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results or crashing.

**6. Timeout**

If the program takes too long to run, it may be timed out by the judge. This can lead to the program being marked as incorrect, even if it is actually correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 962_F. Simple Cycles Edges

Pain points:
```
Possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect graph representation.** The graph is represented as an adjacency list, where each vertex is represented by a list of its adjacent vertices. However, the graph may not be connected, so some vertices may not have any adjacent vertices. In this case, the developer may incorrectly assume that the graph is connected and try to find a cycle in it, which will lead to a runtime error.
* **Incorrect cycle detection algorithm.** The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to detect cycles in the graph. For example, the developer may use a depth-first search algorithm, which will not be able to detect all cycles in the graph.
* **Incorrect output format.** The developer may incorrectly format the output of the program. For example, the developer may not print the edges in increasing order, or the developer may not print the indices of the edges.
* **Incorrect error handling.** The developer may not handle errors correctly. For example, the developer may not handle the case where the input is invalid.

2. **Incorrect data type.** The input data should be integers. Make sure to cast the input data to the correct data type before you start processing it.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When you're iterating over a list, make sure to check the bounds of the list carefully. It's easy to make a mistake and miss one or more elements.
4. **Indexing errors.** When you're accessing elements of a list, make sure to use the correct index. It's easy to make a mistake and access the wrong element.
5. **Logic errors.** Make sure your logic is correct. It's easy to make a mistake and get the wrong answer.
6. **Memory leaks.** Make sure you're freeing up memory when you're done with it. If you don't, you could run out of memory and your program will crash.
7. **Synchronization errors.** If you're writing multi-threaded code, make sure you're using the correct synchronization primitives to avoid race conditions.
8. **Security vulnerabilities.** Make sure your code is secure. It's easy to make a mistake and introduce a security vulnerability.

Title:
HACKEREARTH ankit-and-race-team-10

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The most important bug that a developer may encounter when solving this problem is an incorrect implementation of the algorithm. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as:

* Using the wrong data structures or algorithms
* Making a mistake in the logic of the algorithm
* Not handling all possible edge cases

To avoid this bug, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement, and to carefully design and implement the algorithm. It is also helpful to test the algorithm on a variety of test cases, to ensure that it is working correctly.

**2. Incorrect input or output format**

Another common bug that developers may encounter is incorrect input or output format. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as:

* Using the wrong data types
* Misunderstanding the format of the input or output
* Not handling all possible edge cases

To avoid this bug, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement, and to carefully format the input and output. It is also helpful to test the program on a variety of test cases, to ensure that it is handling the input and output correctly.

**3. Memory leaks**

A memory leak is a bug that occurs when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

To avoid memory leaks, it is important to use the `free()` function to free any memory that is allocated. It is also helpful to use a memory debugger to track down any memory leaks that may occur.

**4. Race conditions**

A race condition is a bug that occurs when two or more threads try to access the same shared resource at the same time. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results or crashing.

To avoid race conditions, it is important to use synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes and semaphores to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.

**5. Deadlocks**

A deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, and none of them can continue. This can lead to the program running indefinitely or crashing.

To avoid deadlocks, it is important to use synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes and semaphores to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time. It is also helpful to use a deadlock detector to track down any deadlocks that may occur.

Title:
HACKEREARTH chandu-and-daspal-2

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem statement is not very clear, so it is possible that a developer may misinterpret it. For example, the statement "The player which makes either one of the values to zero or both to zero will win the game and will eat all the MOMO's" could be interpreted to mean that the player who makes either x or y equal to zero wins, even if the other value is not zero. This is not the case; the player who makes both x and y equal to zero wins.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for solving this problem is not very difficult, but it is possible to make mistakes in the implementation. For example, a developer might forget to check if either x or y is equal to zero before subtracting the gcd, or they might not correctly update the values of x and y after subtracting the gcd.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement does not explicitly mention any edge cases, but there are a few that a developer should be aware of. For example, what happens if x and y are both equal to zero? What happens if x and y are both equal to 1? What happens if x and y are both negative? A developer should make sure to handle these edge cases correctly.
4. **Incorrect testing.** It is important to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct. This includes testing for all possible input values, as well as testing for edge cases. A developer should also test the code with different values of x and y to make sure that the algorithm works correctly for all possible values.
5. **Incorrect documentation.** The code should be well-documented so that other developers can understand how it works. This includes providing a detailed description of the algorithm, as well as comments in the code that explain what each line of code does.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.

Title:
HACKEREARTH digital-numbers

Pain points:
```
Possible Bugs and Problems:

1. The input format is not correct. The input should be a list of lists, where each list contains two integers: L and M. For example, [[1, 14], [1, 50], [4, 28], [5, 700]]
2. The output format is not correct. The output should be a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of different digits Bosky can represent on the rectangular board. For example, [1, 10, 3, 32491]
3. The code does not handle the case where M is not a multiple of 7. For example, if M = 11, the code will throw an error.
4. The code does not handle the case where L is not a multiple of 2. For example, if L = 3, the code will throw an error.
5. The code is not efficient. It takes O(T * L) time to run, where T is the number of test cases and L is the length of the rectangular board.

Here are some possible solutions to these problems:

1. The input format can be fixed by using the `re` module to parse the input string. For example, the following code can be used to parse the input string:

```
import re

def parse_input(input_string):
  """Parses the input string and returns a list of lists, where each list contains two integers: L and M."""

  pattern = r"(\d+) (\d+)"
  matches = re.findall(pattern, input_string)
  return [list(match) for match in matches]
```

2. The output format can be fixed by using the `list()` function to convert the list of digits to a list of integers. For example, the following code can be used to convert the list of digits to a list of integers:

```
def digits_to_integers(digits):
  """Converts the list of digits to a list of integers."""

  return [int(digit) for digit in digits]
```

3. The case where M is not a multiple of 7 can be handled by using the `math` module to find the remainder of M when divided by 7. For example, the following code can be used to find the remainder of M when divided by 7:

```
import math

def remainder(m):
  """Finds the remainder of m when divided by 7."""

  return m % 7
```

4. The case where L is not a multiple of 2 can be handled by using the `math` module to find the remainder of L when divided by 2. For example, the following code can be used to find the remainder of L when divided by 2:

```
import math

def remainder(l):
  """Finds the remainder of l when divided by 2."""

  return l % 2
```

5. The code can be made more efficient by using the following optimizations:

    * Use a dictionary to store the number of digits that can be represented using each number of LED tubes. For example, the following dictionary can be used to store the number of digits that can be represented using each number of LED tubes:

        ```
        digits_by_tubes = {
            2: ['1'],
            3: ['7'],
            4: ['4'],
            5: ['2', '3', '5'],
            6: ['0', '6'],
            7: ['8'],
        }
        ```

    * Use a list to store the digits that can be represented using the given number of LED tubes. For example, the following list can be used to store the digits that can be represented using the given number of LED tubes:

        ```
        digits = ['1', '7', '4', '2', '3', '5', '0', '6', '8']
        ```

    * Use a for loop to iterate over the list of digits and check if the digit can be represented using the given number of LED tubes. For example, the following for loop can be used to iterate over the list of digits and check if the digit can be represented using the given number of LED tubes:

        ```
        for digit in digits:
            if can_digit_be_represented(digit, tubes):
                digits_represented.append(digit)

HACKEREARTH monks-birthday-party

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be a single integer `T` on the first line, followed by `T` test cases. Each test case should have a single integer `N` on the first line, followed by `N` names on the second line.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a single line for each test case, containing the names in the final invite list, sorted lexicographically.
3. **Incorrect use of data structures**. The data structures used to store the names and track duplicates should be appropriate for the problem size. For example, using a hash table to store the names would be inefficient for large datasets.
4. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to find the final invite list should be correct and efficient. For example, a simple linear scan of the names would be inefficient for large datasets.
5. **Off-by-one errors**. It is important to be careful about off-by-one errors when iterating over the names and tracking duplicates.
6. **Memory leaks**. It is important to free any allocated memory when the program terminates.
7. **Synchronization issues**. If multiple threads are accessing the same data structures, it is important to use synchronization mechanisms to avoid race conditions.

Title:
HACKEREARTH play-with-string

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of indexes.** The indexes in the problem statement are 0-indexed, but the developer may accidentally use 1-indexed indexes. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of absolute value.** The absolute value of a number is the distance between that number and 0. For example, the absolute value of 5 is 5, and the absolute value of -5 is also 5. The developer may accidentally calculate the absolute value incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect comparison of strings.** The problem statement requires that the condition |Si−Si−1|=|Ri−Ri−1| be true for every i from 1 to N−1. This means that the developer must compare the corresponding characters in the string S and the reverse of the string S. The developer may accidentally compare the strings incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement does not specify what to do if the string S is empty or if the string S has only one character. The developer must handle these edge cases correctly, or the code may not work as expected.

HACKEREARTH roy-and-wobbly-numbers

Pain points:
**1. Input Format**

The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.

Each of the next T lines contains two space separated integers N and K, denoting the length of the wobbly number and the kth wobbly number to be found, respectively.

**2. Output Format**

For each test case, print the kth wobbly number in a new line. If the number does not exist, print -1.

**3. Constraints**

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
3 ≤ N ≤ 1000
1 ≤ K ≤ 100

1313
1414
12121

**Explanations**

The first 10 terms of 3-length wobbly numbers arranged lexicographically is as follows:
101, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 202

1st wobbly number of length 3 is 101.
2nd wobbly number of length 3 is 121.
100th wobbly number of length 3 does not exist, so the output is -1.

The first 10 terms of 4-length wobbly numbers arranged lexicographically is as follows:
1010, 1212, 1313, 1414, 1515, 1616, 1717, 1818, 1919, 2020

3rd wobbly number of length 4 is 1313.
4th wobbly number of length 4 is 1414.

Similarly 2nd wobbly number of length 5 is 12121

**5. Possible Bugs and Solutions**

1. **Incorrect input format**

The input format is not correct. For example, the input format may be missing a space between two integers. This can be fixed by checking the input format and making sure that it is correct.
2. **Incorrect output format**

The output format is not correct. For example, the output may not be a single integer. This can be fixed by checking the output format and making sure that it is correct.
3. **Incorrect calculation**

The calculation of the kth wobbly number may be incorrect. For example, the calculation may not take into account the fact that the wobbly numbers are lexicographically sorted. This can be fixed by checking the calculation and making sure that it is correct.
4. **Incorrect error handling**

The code may not handle errors correctly. For example, the code may not handle the case where the kth wobbly number does not exist. This can be fixed by adding error handling to the code.
5. **Inefficient code**

The code may be inefficient. For example, the code may use a brute force approach to find the kth wobbly number. This can be fixed by using a more efficient algorithm to find the kth wobbly number.

The input format is not correctly specified. For example, the input format is missing a comma between two integers.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not correctly specified. For example, the output format is missing a newline character between two integers.

**3. Incorrect calculation**

The probability of Snuke winning is calculated incorrectly. For example, the probability of Snuke winning is calculated as the sum of the probabilities of Snuke winning on each beam, instead of the product of the probabilities of Snuke winning on each beam.

**4. Off-by-one error**

The calculation of the probability of Snuke winning is off by one. For example, the probability of Snuke winning is calculated as 1 - (1 / (A_1 + B_1)), instead of 1 - (1 / (A_1 * B_1)).

**5. Floating-point error**

The calculation of the probability of Snuke winning is affected by floating-point error. For example, the probability of Snuke winning is calculated as 0.5000000000000001, instead of 0.5.

ATCODER p03150 KEYENCE Programming Contest 2019 - KEYENCE String

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input string is a string of lowercase English letters. If the developer uses the wrong data type, such as an integer, the program will not work correctly.

**2. Not handling the empty string correctly**

The input string can be empty. If the developer does not handle the empty string correctly, the program will not work correctly.

Title:
ATCODER p03294 AtCoder Beginner Contest 103 - Modulo Summation

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input constraints state that all values are integers. However, if you accidentally use a floating-point data type to store the values, you may get incorrect results. For example, if you store the value `1000` as a float, it will be rounded to `1000.0`, which is not an integer. This could lead to errors in your calculations.

**2. Not taking into account the modulo operator**

The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder of a division. This means that if you divide an integer by another integer, the modulo operator will return the value that is left over. For example, `10 % 3` returns `1`, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.

In this problem, you need to take into account the modulo operator when calculating the value of `f(m)`. For example, if `a_1` is equal to 3, then `(m % a_1)` will always return a value between 0 and 2. This means that the maximum value of `f(m)` will be `3 * 3 = 9`.

**3. Not considering all possible values of `m`**

The problem statement states that `m` can be any non-negative integer. This means that you need to consider all possible values of `m`, from 0 to `10^18`. If you only consider a limited range of values for `m`, you may not find the maximum value of `f(m)`.

**4. Making a mistake in your calculations**

It is easy to make a mistake in your calculations when solving this problem. Be careful to double-check your work to make sure that you have found the correct answer.

**5. Using an inefficient algorithm**

The naive algorithm for solving this problem would be to iterate over all possible values of `m` and calculate the value of `f(m)` for each value. This would be very inefficient, as the number of possible values of `m` is very large.

A more efficient algorithm would be to use a dynamic programming approach. This would involve building up a table of values for `f(m)`, starting with the base case `f(0)`. Once the table is built, you can find the maximum value of `f(m)` by simply looking up the value in the table.

**6. Not using the provided code template**

The AtCoder website provides a code template for each problem. This template includes the necessary boilerplate code, such as the input and output functions. Using the provided code template will save you time and help you avoid errors.
Test inputs:
1. **Incorrect data type**

```
N = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
ans = 0
for i in range(N):
    if a[i] > ans:
        ans = a[i]
print(ans)
```

This program will not work because the input values are integers, but the variable `ans` is a float. This will cause the program to round the values to the nearest integer, which will result in an incorrect answer.

2. **Not taking into account the modulo operator**

```
N = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
ans = 0
for i in range(N):
    ans += a[i]
print(ans)
```

This program will not work because it does not take into account the modulo operator. This means that the value of `ans` will not be a multiple of `a_1`, which is a requirement for the maximum value of `f(m)`.

3. **Not considering all possible values of `m`**

```
N = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
ans = 0
for m in range(10 ** 18):
    ans = max(ans, sum(m % a for a in a))
print(ans)
```

This program will not work because it only considers values of `m` up to `10 ** 18`. However, the maximum value of `f(m)` could be greater than `10 ** 18`.

4. **Making a mistake in your calculations**

```
N = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
ans = 0
for i in range(N):
    if a[i] > ans:
        ans = a[i]
    ans += a[i]
print(ans)
```

This program will not work because it makes a mistake in its calculations. The value of `ans` is incremented by `a[i]` twice, which will result in an incorrect answer.

5. **Using an inefficient algorithm**

```
N = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
ans = 0
for m in range(10 ** 18):
    ans = max(ans, sum(m % a for a in a))
print(ans)
```

This program uses an inefficient algorithm to find the maximum value of `f(m)`. The algorithm iterates over all possible values of `m`, which is very inefficient.

6. **Not using the provided code template**

```
N = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
ans = 0
for i in range(N):
    if a[i] > ans:
        ans = a[i]
    ans += a[i]
print(ans)
```

This program will not work because it does not use the provided code template. The AtCoder website provides a code template for each problem, which includes the necessary boilerplate code, such as the input and output functions. Using the provided code template will save you time and help you avoid errors.

Here are some program inputs that will validate whether an implementation meets each of the requirements listed above:

1. **Incorrect data type**

```
N = 3
a = [3, 4, 6]
ans = 0
for i in range(N):
    if a[i] > ans:
        ans = a[i]
print(ans)
```

This program will print the output `3`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `10`.

2. **Not taking into account the modulo operator**

```
N = 3
a = [3, 4, 6]
ans = 0
for i in range(N):
    ans += a[i]
print(ans)
```

This program will print the output `13`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `10`.

3. **Not considering all possible values of `m`**

```
N = 3
a = [3, 4, 6]
ans = 0
for m in range(10 ** 18):
    ans = max(ans, sum(

### Possible Problems and Bugs ###

1. **Incorrectly calculating the time it takes to give a candy to a bear.** The player can only give a candy to a bear if the player is at the exact same position of the bear. This means that the player must first move to the position of the bear, which takes time. The player must also wait for the bear to produce a coin, which takes time.
2. **Incorrectly calculating the time it takes to pick up a coin.** The player can only pick up a coin if the player is at the exact same position of the coin. This means that the player must first move to the position of the coin, which takes time.
3. **Incorrectly calculating the time it takes to go to the exit.** The player must first move to the position of the exit, which takes time.
4. **Incorrectly handling the case where a bear produces a coin at the same time that the player is at the position of the bear.** In this case, the player can either pick up the coin or give the bear a candy. The player must choose the option that results in the shortest time.
5. **Incorrectly handling the case where the player reaches the exit before all of the coins have been collected.** In this case, the player must wait for the remaining coins to be produced before they can leave the game.

### Solutions ###

To avoid these problems, you can follow these steps:

1. Carefully read the problem statement and understand the constraints.
2. Develop a clear and concise solution.
3. Test your solution thoroughly.
4. Be sure to submit your solution before the deadline.

Here is a possible solution to the problem:

```
def solve():
  # Get the input.
  N, E, T = map(int, input().split())
  xs = list(map(int, input().split()))

  # Sort the bears by their position.
  xs.sort()

  # Calculate the time it takes to give a candy to each bear.
  candy_times = [xs[i+1] - xs[i] for i in range(N-1)]

  # Calculate the time it takes to pick up each coin.
  coin_times = [T + xs[i] for i in range(N)]

  # Calculate the time it takes to go to the exit.
  exit_time = E - xs[-1]

  # Find the maximum of the time it takes to give a candy to a bear, pick up a coin, and go to the exit.
  max_time = max(candy_times + coin_times + [exit_time])

  # Print the answer.
  print(max_time)


# Solve the problem.
solve()

**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrectly implementing the logic of the message relaying game.** This could lead to the incorrect inference of the original message.
* **Incorrectly handling messages with non-alphabetic characters.** The problem statement specifies that messages consist of digits and alphabetic characters, but it does not specify how to handle messages that contain other characters. A developer could incorrectly assume that all characters are alphabetic, which would lead to the incorrect inference of the original message.
* **Incorrectly handling messages with leading or trailing spaces.** The problem statement does not specify how to handle messages with leading or trailing spaces. A developer could incorrectly assume that all messages are properly trimmed, which would lead to the incorrect inference of the original message.
* **Incorrectly handling messages with duplicate characters.** The problem statement does not specify how to handle messages with duplicate characters. A developer could incorrectly assume that all messages have unique characters, which would lead to the incorrect inference of the original message.
* **Incorrectly handling messages with invalid characters.** The problem statement does not specify which characters are valid. A developer could incorrectly assume that all characters are valid, which would lead to the incorrect inference of the original message.

**Some additional tips for solving this problem:**

* Use a test suite to verify the correctness of your implementation.
* Use a debugger to help you track down bugs.
* Ask for help from other developers if you are stuck.

Pain points:
## Possible Problems and Bugs ##

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to put a space between two numbers, the input will be interpreted incorrectly.
2. **Incorrect calculation of distances**. The distances between points and between points and circles must be calculated correctly. A common mistake is to forget to square the distances before taking the square root.
3. **Incorrect selection of destinations**. The destinations for the red and blue points must be chosen carefully so that they do not pass through the inside of either circle. A common mistake is to choose a destination that is too close to one of the circles.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the total distance traveled**. The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances traveled by the red and blue points. A common mistake is to forget to add the distances traveled by the two points.
5. **Incorrect output**. The output must be a single number, which is the minimum value of the total distance traveled. A common mistake is to output a number that is too large or too small.

## How to Avoid These Problems ##

1. **Be careful when reading the input**. Make sure to read the input carefully and make sure that you understand the format. If you are not sure about the format, you can always check the problem statement or the sample input and output.
2. **Double-check your calculations**. Make sure to double-check all of your calculations, especially the distances between points and between points and circles. A simple mistake can lead to a wrong answer.
3. **Choose your destinations carefully**. When choosing the destinations for the red and blue points, make sure that they do not pass through the inside of either circle. A good way to do this is to draw a picture of the two circles and the red and blue points.
4. **Carefully calculate the total distance traveled**. The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances traveled by the red and blue points. Make sure to add the distances traveled by the two points.
5. **Test your code**. Once you have written your code, it is important to test it thoroughly. You can test your code by using the sample input and output. You can also test your code by generating your own input and output.

AIZU p01219 Private Teacher

Pain points:
Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain invalid characters or the number of elements in a list may not match the expected number.
* **Incorrect data type:** The input data may be of the wrong data type. For example, the number of lessons a pupil needs may be a string instead of an integer.
* **Off-by-one errors:** The developer may make off-by-one errors when counting the number of lessons that need to be taught or the number of weeks that are left.
* **Incorrect logic:** The developer may make mistakes in the logic of the program. For example, the program may not correctly check if all the lessons can be taught within the number of weeks that are left.
* **Memory errors:** The program may run out of memory if it is not careful about allocating and freeing memory.
* **Time complexity:** The program may take too long to run if it is not efficient.
* **Incorrect output:** The program may output incorrect results if it has any of the above problems.

To avoid these problems, the developer should carefully check the input format, data types, and logic of the program. The developer should also use a memory-efficient algorithm and test the program thoroughly to ensure that it produces correct results.

Title:
AIZU p01535 Markup language has Declined

Pain points:
The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are as follows:

1. **Incorrect parsing of the DML and DS files.** The DML and DS files are both text files, and they can be easily misinterpreted by the parser. For example, if a tag is not closed properly, the parser may misinterpret the contents of the tag. Similarly, if a subroutine name is misspelled, the parser may not be able to find the corresponding subroutine.
2. **Incorrect execution of the DS file.** The DS file contains a series of instructions that are executed when a button is clicked. If one of these instructions is incorrect, the program may not behave as expected. For example, if an instruction is missing a semicolon, the program may not execute the next instruction. Similarly, if an instruction is not in the correct format, the program may not be able to parse it.
3. **Incorrect handling of user input.** The program must be able to handle user input correctly. For example, if the user clicks on a link or button that does not exist, the program must not crash. Similarly, if the user clicks on a link or button multiple times, the program must not execute the same subroutine multiple times.
4. **Incorrect handling of errors.** The program must be able to handle errors gracefully. For example, if the program encounters a file that does not exist, it must not crash. Similarly, if the program encounters a syntax error in the DML or DS file, it must not crash.

By carefully following the instructions in the problem statement and avoiding these common problems, developers can successfully solve this problem.

Title:
AIZU p02257 Prime Numbers

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly checking if a number is prime.** A common mistake is to check if a number is prime by dividing it by all numbers from 2 to the square root of the number. This is incorrect because a number can be divisible by a number greater than its square root. For example, 10 is divisible by 5, which is greater than its square root of 3.
2. **Using an inefficient algorithm to check if a number is prime.** The most efficient algorithm for checking if a number is prime is the **Sieve of Eratosthenes**. This algorithm works by first creating a list of all the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number you want to check. It then marks all of the multiples of these numbers as non-prime. The number you are checking is prime if it is not marked as non-prime.
3. **Using a wrong data type to store the numbers.** The numbers in the input list can be very large. If you use a data type that is not large enough, you may get an overflow error.
4. **Not handling invalid input correctly.** The input list may contain invalid values, such as negative numbers or non-integers. You need to make sure to handle these values correctly.
5. **Not printing the output correctly.** The output should be a single integer that represents the number of prime numbers in the input list. You need to make sure that the output is formatted correctly.
