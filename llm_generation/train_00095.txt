Title:
CODECHEF hclean

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not very clear. It is not clear whether the first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and D or two integers N and D. This can lead to the developer misinterpreting the input format and making a mistake.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is also not very clear. It is not clear whether the output should be a list of all possible routes or just one route. This can lead to the developer misinterpreting the output format and making a mistake.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the euclidean distance**

The euclidean distance between two points is calculated using the following formula:

```
d = sqrt( (x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2 + ... + (z1 - z2)^2 )
```

However, the developer may accidentally use a different formula, such as the Manhattan distance, which is calculated using the following formula:

```
d = |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2| + ... + |z1 - z2|
```

This can lead to the developer incorrectly calculating the euclidean distance and making a mistake.

**4. Incorrect determination of whether a route exists**

The developer may incorrectly determine whether a route exists by checking whether the euclidean distance between any two adjacent rooms in the route is less than or equal to D. However, this is not sufficient to guarantee that the route exists. The developer must also check that the route visits all of the rooms.

**5. Incorrect implementation of the backtracking algorithm**

The backtracking algorithm is a recursive algorithm that can be used to find all possible solutions to a problem. However, the developer may incorrectly implement the backtracking algorithm and make a mistake.

**6. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

The developer must be careful to handle edge cases correctly. For example, the developer must handle the case where the number of dimensions is 0 or 1.

**7. Incorrect error handling**

The developer must be careful to handle errors correctly. For example, the developer must handle the case where the input is invalid.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1063_A. Oh Those Palindromes

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of palindromes.** A common mistake is to only count palindromes of length 1, or to only count palindromes that are centered around the middle of the string. The correct way to count the number of palindromes is to consider all substrings of the string, and to check whether each substring is a palindrome.
2. **Not considering all possible rearrangements of the characters.** Another common mistake is to only consider a few possible rearrangements of the characters, such as sorting the characters in alphabetical order or reversing the string. The correct way to find the maximum possible value of the palindromic count is to consider all possible rearrangements of the characters.
3. **Using an inefficient algorithm.** The naive algorithm for counting the number of palindromes in a string takes O(n^2) time, where n is the length of the string. There are more efficient algorithms that can be used to count the number of palindromes in a string in O(n) time.
4. **Using incorrect data structures.** The data structures used to store the characters in the string and to count the number of palindromes can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. It is important to use data structures that are appropriate for the problem being solved.
5. **Making a programming error.** Even the most carefully written code can contain errors. It is important to carefully test the code to ensure that it is correct.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. Use a dynamic programming algorithm to count the number of palindromes. This will allow you to count the number of palindromes in O(n) time.
2. Consider all possible rearrangements of the characters. This will ensure that you find the maximum possible value of the palindromic count.
3. Use efficient data structures to store the characters in the string and to count the number of palindromes. This will improve the performance of the algorithm.
4. Carefully test your code to ensure that it is correct. This will help you to avoid errors.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1084_F. Max Mex

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect implementation of the MEX function.** The MEX function should return the smallest non-negative integer that is not included in the given set. A common mistake is to return the smallest integer in the set.
* **Incorrect implementation of the DFS traversal.** The DFS traversal should visit all nodes in the tree in a depth-first order. A common mistake is to visit the nodes in a breadth-first order.
* **Incorrect implementation of the LCA algorithm.** The LCA algorithm should find the lowest common ancestor of two given nodes in the tree. A common mistake is to find the node that is an ancestor of both given nodes.
* **Incorrect implementation of the query processing.** The query processing code should correctly update the permutation and the MEX values of the affected nodes. A common mistake is to update the permutation and the MEX values of all nodes in the tree.
* **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer for each query. A common mistake is to output a list of integers or a string.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1104_C. Grid game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of tiles in the input string.** This is a common mistake that can be easily avoided by using a `for` loop to iterate over the string and increment a counter variable each time a tile is encountered.
2. **Not handling the case where the input string is empty.** This can be done by adding an `else` clause to the `for` loop that checks if the string is empty and prints an error message if it is.
3. **Incorrectly placing the tiles in the grid.** This can be avoided by making sure that the tiles are placed in a way that they do not overlap and that they do not cover any cells that have already been deleted.
4. **Not deleting the cells that are covered by the tiles.** This can be done by iterating over the grid after each tile is placed and checking if any cells are completely covered. If a cell is completely covered, it should be removed from the grid.
5. **Printing the output in the wrong format.** The output should be a list of `r,c` pairs, where `r` is the row number of the tile and `c` is the column number. Each pair should be printed on a new line.

Here are some tips for debugging your solution:

1. Use a debugger to step through your code and see where the errors are occurring.
2. Print out the values of your variables to see if they are what you expect them to be.
3. Use a different input to see if your solution is still correct.
4. Ask for help from a friend or mentor.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1132_A. Regular Bracket Sequence

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input consists of four integers, so the developer should use `int` data type to store them. However, if the developer uses a smaller data type, such as `short` or `char`, they may encounter an overflow error.

**2. Using incorrect operators**

The problem statement states that a bracket sequence is regular if it is possible to obtain a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into it. However, if the developer uses the `+` operator to add two integers, they will get the wrong answer. The correct operator to use in this case is the `|` operator.

**3. Not considering all possible cases**

The problem statement states that the input consists of four integers. However, the developer may mistakenly assume that the input consists of three integers. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**4. Using incorrect logic**

The problem statement states that a regular bracket sequence must have an equal number of opening and closing brackets. However, the developer may mistakenly assume that a regular bracket sequence must have exactly one opening and one closing bracket. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**5. Not handling errors correctly**

The problem statement does not specify how to handle errors. However, the developer should handle errors gracefully by printing an appropriate error message and exiting the program.

**6. Not testing the code thoroughly**

The developer should test the code thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly for all possible inputs. This can be done by creating a set of test cases and running the code on each test case. The developer should also check the code for logical errors.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1152_D. Neko and Aki's Prank

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the trie data structure**

The trie data structure is a key-value data structure that is used to store strings. It is a tree-like data structure in which each node represents a character in the string. The edges of the tree represent the transitions between characters.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing a trie data structure is to incorrectly implement the insert() method. The insert() method should add a new node to the trie for the given string. However, some developers mistakenly add a new node for each character in the string. This can lead to a trie that is much larger than necessary and can also lead to incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the maximum matching algorithm**

The maximum matching algorithm is an algorithm that finds the maximum number of edges in a graph such that no two edges share a common vertex. The maximum matching algorithm is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a variety of problems.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing the maximum matching algorithm is to incorrectly initialize the matching matrix. The matching matrix is a matrix of boolean values that indicates whether or not an edge is in the matching. Some developers mistakenly initialize the matching matrix to all false values. This can lead to incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect handling of overflow**

The maximum matching algorithm can sometimes produce results that are larger than the maximum value that can be represented by a signed integer. This can lead to overflow errors.

One way to avoid overflow errors is to use unsigned integers instead of signed integers. Another way to avoid overflow errors is to use the modulo operator (%). The modulo operator returns the remainder of a division operation. This means that if the result of a division operation is larger than the maximum value that can be represented by a signed integer, the modulo operator will return the remainder of the division operation.

**4. Incorrect use of the mod operator**

The mod operator (%) is a mathematical operator that returns the remainder of a division operation. The mod operator is often used to perform modular arithmetic. Modular arithmetic is a type of arithmetic in which all of the numbers are taken modulo a fixed number.

One common mistake that developers make when using the mod operator is to forget to apply the mod operator to the result of a calculation. This can lead to incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect use of the pow() function**

The pow() function is a mathematical function that returns the value of a number raised to a given power. The pow() function is often used to calculate exponents.

One common mistake that developers make when using the pow() function is to forget to apply the mod operator to the result of the calculation. This can lead to incorrect results.

**6. Incorrect use of the factorial() function**

The factorial() function is a mathematical function that returns the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a number is the product of all of the numbers from 1 to that number.

One common mistake that developers make when using the factorial() function is to forget to apply the mod operator to the result of the calculation. This can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Not considering the case where all elements are even.** In this case, the lexicographically smallest array is the array itself. Make sure to handle this case correctly.
3. **Not handling the case where the array is empty.** In this case, the output should be an empty array. Make sure to handle this case correctly.
4. **Not handling the case where the array contains only one element.** In this case, the output should be the same element. Make sure to handle this case correctly.
5. **Not handling the case where the array contains only two elements.** In this case, the output should be the array sorted in ascending order. Make sure to handle this case correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1192_A. Building Skyscrapers

Pain points:
Here are some of the most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading in the data. For example, if you forget to add a space between the two integers in a coordinate, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
* **Off-by-one errors:** When iterating over the skyscrapers, it is easy to make a mistake and miss one or more skyscrapers. This can lead to incorrect results, or even a segmentation fault.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic for determining whether a skyscraper can be built in a given location is complex, and it is easy to make a mistake. For example, you might forget to check whether the skyscraper is reachable from outside the Metropolis, or you might not correctly account for the fact that skyscrapers can share corners.
* **Memory leaks:** The program uses a lot of memory, and it is important to make sure that all of the memory is freed when the program is finished. If you do not free the memory correctly, your program will eventually run out of memory and crash.
* **Synchronization issues:** The program uses multiple threads to build the skyscrapers, and it is important to make sure that the threads are synchronized correctly. If the threads are not synchronized, the program may produce incorrect results.
* **Race conditions:** The program may experience race conditions when multiple threads are trying to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results, or even a segmentation fault.

By carefully avoiding these problems and bugs, you can write a correct and efficient solution to this problem.

1. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** This is the most common problem that developers encounter when solving problems. The algorithm may be incorrect due to a number of reasons, such as a logical error, a mistake in the implementation, or a misunderstanding of the problem statement.
2. **Incorrect input/output.** The developer may not correctly read the input from the console or write the output to the file. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
3. **Memory leaks.** The developer may not correctly free the memory that is allocated during the execution of the program. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
4. **Race conditions.** The developer may not correctly synchronize access to shared data between multiple threads. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
5. **Deadlocks.** The developer may not correctly handle deadlocks in the program. This can lead to the program being stuck in an infinite loop.
6. **Security vulnerabilities.** The developer may not correctly implement security features in the program. This can lead to attackers being able to exploit the program and gain unauthorized access to data.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements. They should then carefully design and implement the algorithm, testing it thoroughly at each stage. Finally, they should carefully check the input/output and ensure that the program does not have any memory leaks or race conditions.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1316_A. Grade Allocation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem is asking you to maximize your own score, but you may mistakenly think that you need to maximize the average score of the class.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the greedy algorithm.** The greedy algorithm in this problem works by iteratively increasing your score by 1 as long as it does not increase the average score of the class. However, you may mistakenly implement the algorithm incorrectly, such as by increasing your score by more than 1 at a time or by increasing your score even if it does increase the average score of the class.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem states that the number of students and the highest possible score are both non-negative integers. However, you may mistakenly handle these edge cases incorrectly, such as by trying to divide by 0 or by trying to access an element of an array that does not exist.
4. **Incorrect error handling.** The problem does not specify what to do if there is no solution to the problem. However, you should still handle this case gracefully, such as by printing an error message or by returning a default value.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

* **Read the problem carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked.**
* **Write out a detailed solution plan before you start coding.** This will help you identify any potential problems in your approach.
* **Test your code thoroughly with a variety of input values.** This will help you catch any bugs in your implementation.
* **Be careful to handle edge cases correctly.**
* **Include error handling in your code.**

By following these tips, you can help to ensure that your solution to this problem is correct and efficient.

CODEFORCES 1337_C. Linova and Kingdom

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, if the number of cities is not an integer, the program will crash.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The data type of the input should be correctly defined. For example, if the number of cities is a string, the program will crash.

**3. Off-by-one error**

When traversing the graph, it is easy to make an off-by-one error and miss a city. This can lead to incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect logic**

The logic of the program should be correct. For example, if the program does not consider all possible cases, it will not give the correct answer.

**5. Runtime error**

The program should be efficient enough to run within the time limit. For example, if the program uses a recursive algorithm to traverse the graph, it will take a long time to run.

Title:
CODEFORCES 137_B. Permutation

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, or if the input contains more or fewer values than expected, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input values must be correct, or the program may crash or produce incorrect results. For example, if the input values are strings instead of integers, the program may not be able to correctly process them.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the program misses or adds one value when performing an operation. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a permutation being considered valid when it is not, or vice versa.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The program's logic may be incorrect, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may not correctly account for all possible cases, or it may make assumptions about the input data that are not always true.
5. **Uncaught exceptions**. The program may not handle exceptions correctly, which can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results. For example, if the program tries to divide by zero, it should throw an exception, but if it does not, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully test the program with a variety of input values and to ensure that the logic is correct. It is also important to use the correct data types and to handle exceptions correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1494_A. ABC String

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect regular bracket sequence**

A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "1" and "+" between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences "()()" and "(())" are regular (the resulting expressions are: "(1)+(1)" and "((1+1)+1)"), and ")(", "(" and ")" are not.

However, the following bracket sequence is not regular: "(()". It cannot be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "1" and "+" between the original characters of the sequence.

To avoid this problem, we need to make sure that the bracket sequence is regular.

**2. Incorrect matching of characters**

The problem statement states that "if for some i and j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) a_i=a_j, then b_i=b_j". This means that if two characters in the input string are the same, then the corresponding characters in the output string must also be the same.

However, the following code does not correctly match characters:

```
def solve(a):
  b = []
  for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == 'A':
      b.append('(')
    elif a[i] == 'B':
      b.append(')')
    elif a[i] == 'C':
      b.append(')')
  return b

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
  a = input()
  print(solve(a))
```

This code will incorrectly match the characters 'A' and 'B', because it does not check if the characters are actually the same.

To avoid this problem, we need to make sure that we correctly match the characters in the input string.

**3. Incorrect handling of odd-length input strings**

The problem statement states that "n is even and 2 ≤ n ≤ 50". This means that all input strings will have an even length. However, the following code does not correctly handle odd-length input strings:

```
def solve(a):
  b = []
  for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == 'A':
      b.append('(')
    elif a[i] == 'B':
      b.append(')')
    elif a[i] == 'C':
      b.append(')')
  return b

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
  a = input()
  print(solve(a))
```

This code will throw an error if the input string is odd-length, because it tries to access the index `len(a) + 1`, which does not exist.

To avoid this problem, we need to make sure that we only handle even-length input strings.

**4. Incorrect use of global variables**

The following code uses a global variable incorrectly:

```
def solve(a):
  global b
  for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == 'A':
      b.append('(')
    elif a[i] == 'B':
      b.append(')')
    elif a[i] == 'C':
      b.append(')')
  return b

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
  a = input()
  solve(a)
  print(b)
```

The problem with this code is that the variable `b` is declared as a global variable, but it is only initialized inside the function `solve()`. This means that the variable `b` will not be initialized when the function `solve()` is not called.

To avoid this problem, we need to make sure that the variable `b` is initialized before the function `solve()` is called.

**5. Incorrect use of recursion**

The following code uses recursion incorrectly:

```
def solve(a, i, j):
  if i == j:
    return 1
  else:
    return solve(a, i + 1, j) + solve(a, i, j - 1)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
  a = input()
  print(solve(a, 0, len

Title:
CODEFORCES 1516_D. Cut

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* The input format is not specified clearly. Does the first line contain the length of the array and the number of queries, or does it contain the array itself?
* The output format is not specified clearly. Does the output contain one integer per query, or does it contain one integer per line?
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the product of the elements in a subarray is not equal to its LCM.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the array is empty.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the number of queries is 0.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the endpoints of a query are not valid.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the array contains duplicate elements.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the array contains negative elements.
* The problem statement does not specify what to do if the array contains zero elements.

**Possible solutions:**

* To avoid ambiguity, the input format should be specified clearly. For example, the input format could be:

```
n q
a_1 a_2 ... a_n
l_1 r_1
l_2 r_2
...
l_q r_q
```

* To avoid ambiguity, the output format should be specified clearly. For example, the output format could be:

```
a_1
a_2
...
a_q
```

* To handle the case where the product of the elements in a subarray is not equal to its LCM, the algorithm could check if the product of the elements in the subarray is divisible by the LCM. If it is not, the algorithm could divide the subarray into two smaller subarrays and recursively compute the number of subarrays in each subarray.
* To handle the case where the array is empty, the algorithm could simply return 0.
* To handle the case where the number of queries is 0, the algorithm could simply return an empty array.
* To handle the case where the endpoints of a query are not valid, the algorithm could simply return -1.
* To handle the case where the array contains duplicate elements, the algorithm could simply ignore the duplicates.
* To handle the case where the array contains negative elements, the algorithm could simply ignore the negative elements.
* To handle the case where the array contains zero elements, the algorithm could simply return 0.

CODEFORCES 191_D. Metro Scheme

Pain points:
### Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem is about finding the minimum and maximum number of lines in a subway system. A line is a sequence of stations that are connected by tunnels. A station can be part of multiple lines. The subway system is a vertex cactus, which means that each vertex lies on no more than one simple cycle.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution should be implemented in a way that takes into account the constraints of the problem. For example, the solution should not create more lines than necessary.
3. **Incorrect testing of the solution.** The solution should be tested with a variety of inputs to ensure that it works correctly. The tests should also cover edge cases, such as inputs that are invalid or inputs that cause the solution to crash.
4. **Incorrect documentation of the solution.** The solution should be well-documented so that other developers can understand how it works. The documentation should include a description of the problem, the solution, and the testing process.
5. **Incorrect submission of the solution.** The solution should be submitted in the correct format and should be accompanied by the correct documentation. The solution should also be submitted on time.

CODEFORCES 215_D. Hot Days

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly. For example, if you are using the `scanf` function in C++, you need to make sure that you are using the correct format specifiers.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. This problem involves a lot of arithmetic, so it is important to be careful about off-by-one errors. For example, if you are computing the sum of a series of numbers, you need to make sure that you are not forgetting to add the first or last number in the series.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic for this problem is relatively straightforward, but it is important to make sure that you are thinking carefully about all of the possible cases. For example, you need to make sure that you are handling the case where the temperature in the bus exceeds the limit.
4. **Memory errors**. This problem does not require a lot of memory, but it is still important to be careful about memory errors. For example, if you are using a dynamic array, you need to make sure that you are freeing the memory when you are done with it.

Title:
CODEFORCES 239_D. Boring Partition

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format for this problem is a bit tricky. It is easy to make a mistake when reading the input and end up with a wrong answer.

For example, if you accidentally read the first line as `n h a1 ... an`, you will end up with a wrong answer because the `h` value will be interpreted as an element of the array.

To avoid this mistake, make sure to read the input carefully and make sure that you understand the format.

### 2. Incorrect output format

The output format for this problem is also a bit tricky. You need to print two lines of output. The first line should contain the minimum goodness of the partition. The second line should contain the partition itself.

For example, if the minimum goodness is 1, you should print `1` on the first line and `1 2 2` on the second line.

To avoid this mistake, make sure to read the problem statement carefully and make sure that you understand the output format.

### 3. Incorrect algorithm

The algorithm that you use to solve this problem is also important. If you use an incorrect algorithm, you will end up with a wrong answer.

For example, if you use a greedy algorithm to solve this problem, you will not be able to find the optimal solution.

To avoid this mistake, make sure to use a correct algorithm. There are many different algorithms that you can use to solve this problem, so do some research and find one that works well.

### 4. Incorrect implementation

Finally, even if you have a correct algorithm, you still need to implement it correctly in order to get the correct answer.

For example, if you make a mistake in your implementation of the merge sort algorithm, you will not be able to sort the array correctly and you will end up with a wrong answer.

To avoid this mistake, make sure to carefully review your code and make sure that it is correct. You can also use a debugging tool to help you find any errors in your code.

CODEFORCES 264_B. Good Sequences

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for storing the input integers.** The input integers are in the range 1 ≤ ai ≤ 105, so they should be stored as integers. Using a smaller data type, such as a short, could lead to incorrect results.
2. **Not handling the case where the input contains duplicate integers.** The problem statement states that the input integers are in strictly increasing order, so there should be no duplicate integers. However, it is possible that the input contains duplicate integers by mistake. If this happens, the solution should handle this case gracefully.
3. **Not handling the case where the input contains an integer that is not good.** The problem statement states that the input integers are good integers. However, it is possible that the input contains an integer that is not good by mistake. If this happens, the solution should handle this case gracefully.
4. **Not correctly computing the length of the longest good sequence.** The length of the longest good sequence is the maximum number of consecutive integers in the input that satisfy the three conditions in the problem statement. To compute this length, the solution should iterate over the input integers, starting with the first integer. At each iteration, the solution should check if the current integer is good and if it is adjacent to the previous integer in the input. If both of these conditions are satisfied, the solution should increment the length of the longest good sequence. The solution should stop iterating when it reaches the end of the input.
5. **Not printing the correct output.** The output should be a single integer, which is the length of the longest good sequence. The solution should print this integer to stdout.

CODEFORCES 288_B. Polo the Penguin and Houses 

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when reading the input data. For example, if the input is "5 2 a", the program will crash because it cannot parse the string "a" as an integer.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also not strictly defined, so it is possible to make a mistake when printing the output data. For example, if the output is "54a", the program will crash because it cannot parse the string "a" as an integer.

**3. Incorrect calculation**

The most common mistake is to make a mistake in the calculation. For example, if the program is supposed to calculate the factorial of 5, but it calculates the factorial of 4 instead, the output will be incorrect.

**4. Overflow**

When calculating large numbers, it is possible to overflow the integer type. For example, if the program is supposed to calculate the product of two 32-bit integers, but the product is greater than 2^31-1, the result will be incorrect.

**5. Memory leaks**

If the program allocates memory but does not release it, it will eventually run out of memory and crash. For example, if the program creates a new array every time it needs to store a new value, it will eventually run out of memory.

**6. Race conditions**

If multiple threads access the same data at the same time, it is possible for them to corrupt the data. For example, if two threads are both trying to update the same variable, it is possible for one thread to overwrite the changes made by the other thread.

**7. Deadlocks**

If two threads are each waiting for the other thread to do something, it is possible for them to deadlock. For example, if one thread is waiting for the other thread to release a lock, and the other thread is waiting for the first thread to release a lock, they will both be stuck waiting for each other and the program will never terminate.

Title:
CODEFORCES 522_A. Reposts

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is specified in the problem statement. Make sure that your code correctly parses the input.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is also specified in the problem statement. Make sure that your code correctly prints the output.

**3. Mismatch between input and output**

Make sure that your code is actually solving the problem. You can check this by running your code on some test cases.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

Be careful when counting the number of elements in a list or array. It is easy to make a mistake and miss one element or count one element twice.

**5. Infinite loops**

Your code should not enter an infinite loop. Make sure that you have a way to terminate the loop in all cases.

**6. Memory leaks**

Your code should not leak memory. Make sure that you release all allocated memory when you are done with it.

**7. Race conditions**

If your code is multi-threaded, you need to be careful to avoid race conditions. A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same shared resource at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even crashes.

**8. Deadlocks**

If your code is multi-threaded, you need to be careful to avoid deadlocks. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can lead to the threads being stuck forever.

Title:
CODEFORCES 639_C. Bear and Polynomials

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data contains integers. However, if you accidentally use a floating-point data type to store the input data, you will get incorrect results. For example, if you use `float` to store the input data, you will get the wrong answer for the following input:

```
3 1000000000
10 -9 -3 5
```

The correct answer is 3, but you will get 4 as the output. This is because `float` can only store a limited number of digits after the decimal point. When the input data is very large, the floating-point number will be rounded to the nearest representable number. In this case, `-9` will be rounded to `-9.0`, which is not equal to `-9`.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The correct algorithm for this problem is to first find the coefficient of `x^2` in the polynomial. If the coefficient of `x^2` is zero, then there is no way to change one coefficient to make `P(2) = 0`. Otherwise, we can change the coefficient of `x^2` to make `P(2) = 0`.

However, if you use the following incorrect algorithm, you will get the wrong answer:

```
def count_ways(n, k, a):
  """
  Counts the number of ways to change one coefficient to make P(2) = 0.

  Args:
    n: The degree of the polynomial.
    k: The limit for absolute values of coefficients.
    a: The coefficients of the polynomial.

  Returns:
    The number of ways to change one coefficient to make P(2) = 0.
  """

  # Find the coefficient of x^2.
  c2 = a[2]

  # If the coefficient of x^2 is zero, then there is no way to change one coefficient
  # to make P(2) = 0.

  if c2 == 0:
    return 0

  # Otherwise, we can change the coefficient of x^2 to make P(2) = 0.

  return 1

```

This algorithm will always return 1, even if the coefficient of `x^2` is not zero. This is because the algorithm does not check if the coefficient of `x^2` is zero.

**3. Using incorrect boundary conditions**

The boundary conditions for this problem are as follows:

* If `n = 1`, then the only way to make `P(2) = 0` is to set `a0 = 0`.
* If `n = 2`, then the only way to make `P(2) = 0` is to set `a2 = 0`.
* If `n > 2`, then we can change the coefficient of `x^2` to make `P(2) = 0`.

However, if you accidentally use the following incorrect boundary conditions, you will get the wrong answer:

```
def count_ways(n, k, a):
  """
  Counts the number of ways to change one coefficient to make P(2) = 0.

  Args:
    n: The degree of the polynomial.
    k: The limit for absolute values of coefficients.
    a: The coefficients of the polynomial.

  Returns:
    The number of ways to change one coefficient to make P(2) = 0.
  """

  # If n = 1, then the only way to make P(2) = 0 is to set a0 = 0.

  if n == 1:
    if a0 == 0:
      return 1
    else:
      return 0

  # If n = 2, then the only way to make P(2) = 0 is to set a2 = 0.

  if n == 2:
    if a2 == 0:
      return 1
    else:
      return 0

  # If n > 2, then we can change the coefficient of x^2 to make P(2) = 0.

  return 1
```

This algorithm will always return 1, even if `n = 1` or `n = 2`. This is because the algorithm does not check the boundary conditions.

CODEFORCES 713_B. Searching Rectangles

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are following the format exactly. For example, you need to make sure that you are using the correct quotation marks, and that you are not missing any spaces. If you do not follow the input format correctly, you will get an error.

**2. Overflow errors**

The problem states that the size of the field can be up to 216. This means that you need to be careful not to overflow your data types when you are doing calculations. For example, if you are using integers to store the coordinates of the rectangles, you need to make sure that the integers are large enough to hold the values.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

It is easy to make off-by-one errors when you are working with arrays or lists. For example, if you are trying to access the element at index 0 of an array, you need to make sure that you are not actually accessing the element at index -1.

**4. Logical errors**

It is important to make sure that your code is logically correct. For example, you need to make sure that you are not using the same variable to store two different values. You also need to make sure that you are not making any assumptions about the input data.

**5. Runtime errors**

It is important to make sure that your code runs correctly. For example, you need to make sure that you are not allocating too much memory, and that you are not using any uninitialized variables.

**6. Memory leaks**

It is important to make sure that you are not leaking memory. This means that you need to make sure that you are freeing any memory that you allocate.

**7. Security vulnerabilities**

It is important to make sure that your code is secure. This means that you need to make sure that you are not using any insecure functions, and that you are not exposing any sensitive data.

CODEFORCES 802_L. Send the Fool Further! (hard)

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the number of friends n is not a positive integer, or the cost c is not a positive integer.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is not in the correct data type. For example, the number of friends n is a string, or the cost c is a float.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program is incorrect. For example, the program does not calculate the expected cost of the trips, or the program does not output the correct answer.
4. **Off-by-one error**. The program misses one or more cases. For example, the program does not consider the case where the social network is a tree with only one node.
5. **Infinite loop**. The program enters an infinite loop. For example, the program does not terminate after a finite number of steps.
6. **Stack overflow**. The program runs out of stack space. For example, the program tries to process a very large input.
7. **Memory leak**. The program does not free up memory that it has allocated. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
8. **Race condition**. The program accesses shared data in a way that can lead to inconsistent results. For example, two threads try to update the same data at the same time.
9. **Deadlock**. The program enters a state where no thread can make progress. This can happen when two threads are waiting for each other to release a lock.
10. **Security vulnerability**. The program has a security vulnerability that could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system. For example, the program does not properly validate user input.

Title:
CODEFORCES 827_A. String Reconstruction

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly defined in the problem statement. A developer may misinterpret the format and make a mistake when parsing the input. For example, the developer may assume that the input consists of a single line containing the string s, when in fact it consists of multiple lines containing information about the strings ti.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format is not strictly defined in the problem statement. A developer may misinterpret the format and make a mistake when printing the output. For example, the developer may print the string s in reverse order, or may print it with extra spaces.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm for solving the problem. For example, the developer may try to find the lexicographically minimal string by brute force, which would be prohibitively time-consuming.

**4. Incorrect data validation**

The developer may not validate the input data correctly. For example, the developer may not check that the strings ti are all non-empty, or that the sum of the lengths of the strings ti does not exceed 106.

**5. Incorrect error handling**

The developer may not handle errors correctly. For example, the developer may not handle the case where the input data is malformed.

**6. Insufficient testing**

The developer may not test their code sufficiently. This could lead to bugs that are not caught until the code is deployed to production.

**7. Insecure code**

The developer may not write secure code. This could lead to vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

**8. Unmaintainable code**

The developer may write code that is difficult to maintain. This could make it difficult to fix bugs or add new features in the future.

**9. Undocumented code**

The developer may not document their code. This could make it difficult for other developers to understand how the code works.

**10. Use of third-party libraries**

The developer may use third-party libraries that are not well-maintained or secure. This could introduce vulnerabilities into the code.

Title:
CODEFORCES 849_A. Odds and Ends

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain a non-negative integer n, and the second line should contain n space-separated non-negative integers. If the input does not match this format, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specifies that the program should output the string "Yes" if it is possible to fulfill the requirements, and "No" otherwise. If the program outputs the wrong string, the judge will not be able to correctly evaluate the program and will likely give it a low score.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The program must correctly implement the logic for determining whether it is possible to divide the sequence into an odd number of non-empty subsegments, each of which has an odd length and begins and ends with odd numbers. If the program's logic is incorrect, it will likely produce incorrect output.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** The program must be careful to account for the possibility that the first or last element of the sequence is even. If the program does not account for this possibility, it may produce incorrect output.
5. **Memory leaks.** The program must be careful to free any memory that it allocates. If the program does not free memory that it allocates, it may eventually run out of memory and crash.
6. **Synchronization issues.** If the program is multi-threaded, it must be careful to synchronize access to shared resources. If the program does not synchronize access to shared resources, it may produce incorrect output or crash.
7. **Race conditions.** If the program is multi-threaded, it must be careful to avoid race conditions. If the program does not avoid race conditions, it may produce incorrect output or crash.
8. **Deadlocks.** If the program is multi-threaded, it must be careful to avoid deadlocks. If the program does not avoid deadlocks, it may hang indefinitely.
9. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program must be careful to avoid security vulnerabilities. If the program does not avoid security vulnerabilities, it may be exploited by attackers.
10. **Other bugs.** There are many other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. Some common examples include:
    * Using the wrong data type for a variable
    * Forgetting to initialize a variable
    * Using an incorrect formula
    * Making a logical error in the program's logic
    * Misunderstanding the problem statement

Title:
CODEFORCES 870_D. Something with XOR Queries

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for the input**

The input to this problem is an integer n, which represents the length of the hidden permutation. If you use the wrong data type for n, such as a char or a string, your program will not be able to process the input correctly.

**2. Forgetting to flush the output**

As the problem states, your program must flush the output after printing each line. If you forget to do this, your program will not be able to print the output correctly and you will receive a "Wrong answer" verdict.

**3. Asking more than 2n queries**

The problem states that your program must not ask more than 2n queries. If you ask more than this, your program will receive a "Wrong answer" verdict.

**4. Asking an invalid query**

The problem states that you can only ask about the xor of two elements in the permutation. If you ask about the xor of two elements that are not in the permutation, your program will receive a "Wrong answer" verdict.

**5. Exiting the program prematurely**

If your program exits prematurely, you will receive a "Wrong answer" verdict. This can happen if your program encounters an error, or if you use a `return` statement to exit the program.

**6. Not printing the final answer**

The problem states that your program must print the final answer in three lines. If you do not print the final answer, you will receive a "Wrong answer" verdict.

**7. Forgetting to include the header file <bits/stdc++.h>**

The problem states that you must use the C++ standard library. If you do not include the header file <bits/stdc++.h>, your program will not be able to compile.

Title:
CODEFORCES 897_C. Nephren gives a riddle

Pain points:
**1. Off-by-one errors**

The most common bug when working with strings is an off-by-one error. This happens when you forget to account for the fact that the first character in a string has index 0, not 1. For example, if you're trying to find the character at index 5 in a string, you would need to start your search at index 4.

**2. Incorrect string slicing**

Another common bug is incorrect string slicing. When you slice a string, you need to make sure that you specify the start and end indices correctly. If you specify the wrong indices, you could end up with a different substring than you intended.

**3. Forgetting to handle edge cases**

When you're writing code, it's important to handle all possible edge cases. For example, what happens if the input string is empty? What happens if the index you're trying to access is out of bounds? Make sure to test your code for all possible edge cases to avoid unexpected bugs.

**4. Using the wrong data type**

Another common bug is using the wrong data type. For example, if you're trying to store a string in an integer variable, you're going to get a compiler error. Make sure to use the correct data type for each variable to avoid this type of error.

**5. Using undefined variables**

Finally, make sure to initialize all variables before you use them. If you try to use an undefined variable, you'll get a compiler error.

Title:
CODEFORCES 918_D. MADMAX

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect graph representation**

The first step in solving this problem is to correctly represent the graph. A common mistake is to represent the graph as an adjacency list or adjacency matrix. However, this is not the correct way to represent a DAG, as a DAG does not have any cycles. The correct way to represent a DAG is as an edge list.

**2. Incorrect topological sort**

Once the graph has been correctly represented, the next step is to perform a topological sort. A topological sort is a linear ordering of the vertices of a DAG such that for every edge (u, v) in the graph, u comes before v in the ordering. A topological sort can be used to find the winner of the game, as the player who moves first in a round will always win if they have a higher-valued character than their opponent.

However, there are a few common mistakes that can be made when performing a topological sort. One common mistake is to use a recursive algorithm to perform the topological sort. This can lead to incorrect results, as recursive algorithms can get stuck in infinite loops.

Another common mistake is to not consider the direction of the edges when performing the topological sort. This can also lead to incorrect results, as the order of the vertices in the topological sort will be incorrect.

**3. Incorrect winner determination**

Once the topological sort has been performed, the winner of the game can be determined. The player who moves first in a round will always win if they have a higher-valued character than their opponent. However, there are a few common mistakes that can be made when determining the winner of the game.

One common mistake is to only consider the characters of the edges that are adjacent to the vertex that the player's marble is on. This can lead to incorrect results, as the player may be able to move to a vertex that has a higher-valued character than their opponent's vertex.

Another common mistake is to not consider the order of the rounds when determining the winner of the game. This can also lead to incorrect results, as the player who moves first in a round may not have a higher-valued character than their opponent.

**4. Incorrect output formatting**

The final step in solving this problem is to correctly format the output. The output should consist of n lines, with each line containing a string of length n. The j-th character in the i-th line should be 'A' if Max will win the game in case her marble is initially at vertex i and Lucas's marble is initially at vertex j, and 'B' otherwise.

A common mistake is to not use the correct number of spaces between the characters in the output. This can make the output difficult to read and understand.

Another common mistake is to not use the correct characters in the output. The characters 'A' and 'B' should be used to indicate the winner of the game, and not any other characters.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format specifies that the input should be a string consisting of zeroes and ones. However, a developer may accidentally input a string that contains other characters. This would cause the program to crash.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format specifies that the output should be either "YES" or "NO". However, a developer may accidentally output a string that does not match this format. This would cause the program to produce an incorrect result.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the number of consecutive players**

The program must calculate the number of consecutive players of the same team. A developer may accidentally calculate this incorrectly, which would cause the program to produce an incorrect result.

**4. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

The program must handle edge cases such as the input string being empty or the input string containing only one player. A developer may accidentally not handle these edge cases correctly, which would cause the program to produce an incorrect result.

**5. Incorrect use of data structures**

The program may use data structures incorrectly, such as using a linked list to store the players' positions. This could lead to the program running slowly or producing an incorrect result.

**6. Incorrect use of algorithms**

The program may use algorithms incorrectly, such as using a bubble sort algorithm to sort the players' positions. This could lead to the program running slowly or producing an incorrect result.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain a newline character at the end of the list B, or the list B may contain non-integer values. The developer should check the input format and handle incorrect inputs appropriately.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer may make off-by-one errors when calculating the average of the elements in the list B. For example, the developer may calculate the average of the first N - 1 elements instead of the first N elements. The developer should carefully check the calculations to avoid off-by-one errors.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may implement the incorrect logic to find the list A. For example, the developer may use the wrong formula to calculate the average of the elements in the list B. The developer should carefully check the logic to ensure that it is correct.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer may create memory leaks when implementing the solution. For example, the developer may not free the memory that is allocated for the list A. The developer should carefully manage the memory to avoid memory leaks.

**Possible Problems and Bugs:**

* The input data may not be correctly formatted. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an unsigned 31-bit integer.
* The input data may contain duplicate values.
* The input data may contain the value 0.
* The output data may not be correctly formatted. For example, the output may not be a single integer.
* The output data may be incorrect. For example, the output may be greater than the minimum possible time.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems and bugs:

* Use the `assert` statement to check that the input data is correctly formatted.
* Use the `set` data structure to remove duplicate values from the input data.
* Check for the value 0 in the input data and handle it appropriately.

Title:
HACKEREARTH logically-correct

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format specified in the problem statement is "Three spaced integer. First is A, second is B and third is Nth number you’ve to calculate.". However, a developer may accidentally input the values in a different format, such as "A B N". This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the Nth term**

The formula for calculating the Nth term of the series is "I(n+2) =(I(n+1))^2 +I(n)". However, a developer may accidentally miscalculate the formula, such as by using "I(n+2) =(I(n+1))^2 -I(n)". This would cause the program to produce incorrect output.

**3. Insufficient boundary checks**

The problem statement specifies that "A ≥ 0", "B ≥ 0", and "0 < N < 9,223,372,036,854,775,807". However, a developer may accidentally forget to check these constraints, which could allow the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**4. Inefficient algorithm**

The algorithm for calculating the Nth term of the series is O(N). However, a developer may accidentally implement a more inefficient algorithm, such as O(N^2). This would cause the program to run slower than necessary.

**5. Unclear code**

The code for calculating the Nth term of the series may be unclear or difficult to read. This could make it difficult for other developers to understand and maintain the code.

Title:
HACKEREARTH technicalities

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 returns 1. However, if the divisor is greater than the dividend, the modulo operator will return a negative number. For example, 10 % -3 returns -2. This can lead to incorrect results if the divisor is not checked for validity.
2. **Incorrect use of the bitwise operators.** The bitwise operators &, |, ^, and ~ perform bitwise operations on their operands. For example, the & operator returns the bitwise AND of its operands. This means that the bits in the result are set to 1 only if the corresponding bits in both operands are set to 1. The | operator returns the bitwise OR of its operands. This means that the bits in the result are set to 1 if either of the corresponding bits in the operands is set to 1. The ^ operator returns the bitwise XOR of its operands. This means that the bits in the result are set to 1 if the corresponding bits in the operands are different. The ~ operator returns the bitwise NOT of its operand. This means that the bits in the result are set to 0 if the corresponding bits in the operand are set to 1, and vice versa.
3. **Incorrect use of the division operator.** The division operator (/) performs integer division. This means that the result is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, 10 / 3 returns 3. However, if the divisor is zero, the division operator will throw a DivideByZeroException.
4. **Incorrect use of the remainder operator.** The remainder operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 returns 1. However, if the divisor is zero, the remainder operator will return zero.
5. **Incorrect use of the exponentiation operator.** The exponentiation operator (**) raises its first operand to the power of its second operand. For example, 2 ** 3 returns 8. However, if the second operand is negative, the exponentiation operator will throw an ArithmeticException.
6. **Incorrect use of the logarithmic operator.** The logarithmic operator (log) returns the logarithm of its first operand to the base of its second operand. For example, log(10, 100) returns 2. However, if the base is less than or equal to 1, the logarithmic operator will throw an IllegalArgumentException.
7. **Incorrect use of the trigonometric functions.** The trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, etc.) return the trigonometric values of their arguments. For example, sin(0) returns 0. However, if the argument is outside of the range of the function, the trigonometric function will throw an IllegalArgumentException.
8. **Incorrect use of the hyperbolic functions.** The hyperbolic functions (sinh, cosh, tanh, etc.) return the hyperbolic values of their arguments. For example, sinh(0) returns 0. However, if the argument is outside of the range of the function, the hyperbolic function will throw an IllegalArgumentException.
9. **Incorrect use of the error functions.** The error functions (erf, erfc, etc.) return the error values of their arguments. For example, erf(0) returns 0. However, if the argument is outside of the range of the function, the error function will throw an IllegalArgumentException.
10. **Incorrect use of the special functions.** The special functions (gamma, beta, etc.) return the special values of their arguments. For example, gamma(1) returns 1. However, if the argument is outside of the range of the function, the special function will throw an IllegalArgumentException.

ATCODER p02633 AtCoder Grand Contest 046 - Takahashikun  The Strider

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect calculation of the number of turns.** The problem statement states that Takahashi turns X degrees counter-clockwise after each move. However, some developers may mistakenly calculate the number of turns as X / 360. This would result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of steps.** The problem statement states that Takahashi moves one meter in the direction he is facing after each turn. However, some developers may mistakenly calculate the number of steps as 1 / X. This would also result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When calculating the number of turns or steps, it is important to be careful to avoid off-by-one errors. For example, if Takahashi is facing north and turns 90 degrees counter-clockwise, he will be facing west. However, if the developer mistakenly calculates the number of turns as 90 - 1 = 89, Takahashi will be facing northwest. This would result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The problem statement states that Takahashi will be at the starting position again after he does the following action K times:

* Go one meter in the direction he is facing. Then, turn X degrees counter-clockwise.

This means that the number of turns, K, must be a multiple of 360. However, some developers may mistakenly use the modulo operator to calculate K, which would result in an incorrect answer. For example, if X = 90 and K = 361, the modulo operator would return 1. This would mean that Takahashi would only need to do the action once to return to the starting position, which is incorrect.
5. **Incorrect use of the conditional operator.** The problem statement states that Takahashi will be at the starting position again after he does the following action K times:

* Go one meter in the direction he is facing. Then, turn X degrees counter-clockwise.

This means that the number of turns, K, must be a multiple of 360. However, some developers may mistakenly use the conditional operator to calculate K, which would result in an incorrect answer. For example, if X = 90 and K = 361, the conditional operator would return 360. This would mean that Takahashi would need to do the action 360 times to return to the starting position, which is incorrect.

## Solution

To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the number of turns, N, that Takahashi needs to make to return to the starting position.
2. Calculate the number of steps, S, that Takahashi needs to take to make N turns.
3. Print the number of times Takahashi will do the action, K, which is equal to S + 1.

```
# Read the input
X = int(input())

# Calculate the number of turns
N = 360 // X

# Calculate the number of steps
S = N * X

# Print the output
print(S + 1)

Title:
ATCODER p02764 AtCoder Beginner Contest 157 - Yakiniku Optimization Problem

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the algorithm**

The most common mistake is to implement the algorithm incorrectly. This can happen in a number of ways, such as:

* Using the wrong formula for calculating the distance between two points.
* Not taking into account the fact that the heat source is a point, not a square.
* Not considering the fact that the meat pieces may be in different quadrants of the plane.

**2. Using incorrect data types**

Another common mistake is to use incorrect data types. This can lead to errors such as:

* The program crashing because it cannot handle numbers that are too large or too small.
* The program giving incorrect results because it is rounding the numbers incorrectly.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

It is important to handle edge cases in your code, such as:

* The case where there are no meat pieces.
* The case where there is only one meat piece.
* The case where all of the meat pieces are in the same location.

**4. Not using efficient algorithms**

It is important to use efficient algorithms when solving this problem, as the input data can be quite large. Some efficient algorithms that you can use include:

* The k-nearest neighbors algorithm
* The Voronoi diagram algorithm
* The Delaunay triangulation algorithm

Title:
ATCODER p03034 AtCoder Beginner Contest 128 - Frog Jump

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect use of variables**

A common mistake is to use the same variable for multiple purposes. For example, you might use `i` to index into the array of lotus scores, but then also use it to track the number of lotus scores you've seen. This can lead to errors when you try to access the scores of lotus that you haven't seen yet.

**2. Off-by-one errors**

Another common mistake is to make an off-by-one error when indexing into an array. For example, you might try to access the score of the lotus at index `N`, but there is no lotus at that index. This can lead to errors when you try to add the score of the lotus to your total score.

**3. Incorrect logic**

Another common mistake is to make a mistake in your logic. For example, you might think that you can always move to the next lotus, but this is not always the case. If the next lotus is too far away, you will drown.

**4. Undefined behavior**

Another common mistake is to cause undefined behavior. For example, you might try to divide by zero or access a memory location that doesn't exist. This can lead to your program crashing or behaving in an unexpected way.

**5. Runtime errors**

Another common mistake is to cause a runtime error. For example, you might try to allocate too much memory or open a file that doesn't exist. This can lead to your program crashing or behaving in an unexpected way.

**6. Security vulnerabilities**

Another common mistake is to create a security vulnerability. For example, you might allow a malicious user to inject code into your program or access sensitive data. This can lead to your program being hacked or your data being stolen.

**7. Inefficient code**

Another common mistake is to write inefficient code. For example, you might use a linear search when you could use a binary search. This can lead to your program running slower than it needs to.

**8. Unmaintainable code**

Another common mistake is to write unmaintainable code. For example, you might use cryptic variable names or write code that is difficult to understand. This can make it difficult for other developers to work on your code or for you to come back to it later.

**9. Undocumented code**

Another common mistake is to not document your code. This can make it difficult for other developers to understand how your code works or for you to come back to it later and remember what it does.

Title:
ATCODER p03175 Educational DP Contest - Independent Set

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the DFS traversal**

The DFS traversal is a recursive algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph in a depth-first order. It is often used to find a path between two vertices in a graph or to find all the connected components of a graph.

In this problem, the DFS traversal is used to find all the vertices that are not adjacent to the current vertex. This is done by marking each vertex as visited as it is visited. If a vertex is already visited, then it is not adjacent to the current vertex.

However, if the DFS traversal is not implemented correctly, then it is possible that a vertex will be visited more than once. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the number of ways to paint the vertices**

Once the DFS traversal has been completed, the number of ways to paint the vertices can be calculated. This is done by multiplying the number of ways to paint each vertex by the number of ways to paint the remaining vertices.

However, if the number of ways to paint each vertex is not calculated correctly, then the final answer will be incorrect.

**3. Incorrect use of the modulo operator**

The modulo operator is used to calculate the remainder of a division. In this problem, the modulo operator is used to ensure that the final answer is a multiple of 10^9 + 7.

However, if the modulo operator is not used correctly, then the final answer may not be a multiple of 10^9 + 7. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**4. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. The first line of input contains the number of vertices in the graph. The next N - 1 lines of input contain the two vertices that are connected by an edge.

If the input format is not correct, then the program will not be able to solve the problem correctly.

**5. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem should be a single integer. This integer represents the number of ways to paint the vertices of the graph.

If the output format is not correct, then the program will not be able to output the correct answer.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain non-integer values, or the sum of A and B may be greater than 16.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be either `Yay!` or `:(`. Any other output format is considered incorrect.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The logic used to determine whether both E869120 and square1001 can obey the instruction in the note is incorrect. For example, the logic may not consider the possibility that the two people take adjacent pieces of cake.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** The logic may incorrectly count the number of pieces of cake that each person takes, or the number of pieces of cake that are left after each person takes their share.

Title:
ATCODER p03477 AtCoder Beginner Contest 083 - Libra

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input values are integers, so we need to make sure that we are using the correct data type to store them. If we use a data type that is too small, we may lose precision and get incorrect results. For example, if we use a `char` to store an integer value, we may only be able to store the first few digits of the value, which could lead to errors.

**2. Using the wrong operator**

The problem states that the balance scale tips to the left if `L > R`, so we need to use the `>` operator to compare the two values. If we use the wrong operator, we may get incorrect results. For example, if we use the `<` operator, we will always get the opposite answer.

**3. Not handling all of the possible cases**

The problem states that the balance scale tips to the left if `L > R`, but it does not say what happens if `L = R`. We need to make sure that we handle this case correctly. We could do this by adding an additional `else if` statement to our code, or by using the `||` operator to combine the two conditions.

**4. Using incorrect formatting**

The problem states that the output should be a single word, so we need to make sure that we are formatting our output correctly. We could do this by using the `printf()` function with the `%s` format specifier.

**5. Forgetting to check for errors**

The `scanf()` function can return an error code if it fails to read a value from the input. We need to make sure that we check for this error and handle it appropriately. We could do this by using the `if` statement to check the return value of the `scanf()` function, or by using the `perror()` function to print an error message.

Title:
ATCODER p03642 AtCoder Regular Contest 080 - Prime Flip

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the prime number algorithm.** The most common mistake is to use an incorrect algorithm for determining whether a number is prime. A simple but inefficient algorithm is to check whether the number is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the number. A more efficient algorithm is to use the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
2. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement specifies that the number of cards is at least 1 and at most 100. A developer who fails to check for these edge cases may get a runtime error or an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The problem statement specifies that the cards are numbered from 1 to 10^7. A developer who uses a data structure that is not able to store this many elements may get a runtime error or an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The problem statement asks for the minimum number of operations required to achieve the objective. A developer who does not correctly account for all of the possible operations may get an incorrect answer.
5. **Failure to debug the code.** Even after carefully implementing the solution, it is possible that there will be errors in the code. A developer who does not properly debug the code may get an incorrect answer.

ATCODER p03799 AtCoder Regular Contest 069 - Scc Puzzle

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input constraints are 1 ≤ N,M ≤ 10^{12}, so we need to use a data type that can store numbers that large. If we use an integer type, we will get an overflow error. We can use a long long type to store these numbers.

**2. Not handling the case where N = 0 or M = 0**

The problem statement says that N and M can be 0. We need to make sure to handle these cases correctly. If N = 0, the answer is 0. If M = 0, the answer is N.

**3. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. We can start by sorting N and M in descending order. Then, we can iterate through the numbers in N and M, combining two c-shaped pieces into an S-shaped piece whenever possible. We can stop when we have used up all of the c-shaped pieces. The number of Scc groups that we can create is the number of S-shaped pieces that we have left.

**4. Making a mistake in the implementation**

There are a few places where we can make a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm. We need to make sure that we correctly sort N and M, and that we correctly combine c-shaped pieces into S-shaped pieces. We also need to make sure that we correctly stop the loop when we have used up all of the c-shaped pieces.

**5. Not testing the code**

It is always important to test the code before submitting it. We can test the code by using some small test cases. We can also test the code by using a random number generator to generate some test cases.

Title:
ATCODER p03968 AtCoder Regular Contest 062 - Building Cubes with AtCoDeer

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not very clear. It is not clear whether the input should be a list of numbers or a list of lists. If the input is a list of numbers, then the first number should be the number of tiles, and the next N numbers should be the colors of the tiles. If the input is a list of lists, then each list should contain the colors of a tile.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format of the problem is also not very clear. It is not clear whether the output should be a single number or a list of numbers. If the output is a single number, then it should be the number of different cubes that can be constructed. If the output is a list of numbers, then each number should be the number of cubes that can be constructed using a specific set of tiles.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the number of different cubes**

The number of different cubes that can be constructed can be calculated by multiplying the number of ways to choose the six tiles by the number of ways to rotate each tile. However, it is important to note that the tiles are not interchangeable. For example, if two tiles have the same colors, then they cannot be used in the same cube.

**4. Incorrect handling of duplicate tiles**

The problem states that two cubes are considered the same only if rotating one in the three dimensional space can obtain an exact copy of the other, including the directions of the tiles. This means that if two cubes have the same colors, but the tiles are in different directions, then they are considered different cubes. It is important to handle duplicate tiles correctly when calculating the number of different cubes.

**5. Incorrect handling of invalid inputs**

The problem states that the number of tiles must be between 6 and 400. If the number of tiles is not in this range, then the program should print an error message. It is also important to handle invalid colors correctly. For example, if a color is not between 0 and 999, then the program should print an error message.

Title:
AIZU p00057 The Number of Area

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of regions.** The most common mistake is to count the number of intersections of the lines, rather than the number of regions. For example, if you draw two parallel lines, you will get three regions, not two.
2. **Not considering all possible ways to draw the lines.** When you are trying to maximize the number of regions, you need to consider all possible ways to draw the lines. For example, if you are given three lines, you could draw them in a row, in a column, or in a triangle. Each of these arrangements will result in a different number of regions.
3. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** There are many different algorithms that you can use to solve this problem. Some algorithms are more efficient than others. It is important to choose an algorithm that is appropriate for the size of the input.
4. **Making a runtime error.** If you are not careful, your code could run into a runtime error. For example, if you try to divide by zero, your program will crash. It is important to test your code carefully to make sure that it does not contain any runtime errors.
5. **Not handling the input correctly.** The input for this problem is a list of integers. It is important to make sure that you parse the input correctly. For example, if you try to read a string as an integer, your program will crash.

Title:
AIZU p00343 Sevens

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly handling the input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to include the newline character after the last game, the program will likely crash.
2. **Not considering all possible outcomes.** When playing a game of cards, there are many possible outcomes that can occur. It is important to make sure that your program considers all of these possibilities, or it may not be able to find a winning strategy.
3. **Making incorrect assumptions about the rules of the game.** The rules of the game of sevens are fairly simple, but it is easy to make a mistake when implementing them in a program. For example, you might forget that players can only play cards that are consecutive to the number of the card in the field.
4. **Using inefficient algorithms.** The problem of finding a winning strategy for sevens is NP-hard, which means that there is no known polynomial-time algorithm for solving it. This means that you will need to use an inefficient algorithm, such as brute force search, to find a solution.
5. **Not testing your program thoroughly.** It is important to test your program thoroughly before submitting it, to make sure that it works correctly. This means testing it on a variety of different inputs, and making sure that it produces the correct output for each one.

Title:
AIZU p01559 MinimumCostPath

Pain points:
**1. Mismatch between input and output format**

The input format is "N M\nX1 Y1\nX2 Y2\n...\nXM YM\n". The output format is "The total number of routes on one line. However, if there is no route to move from the mass (1, 1) to the mass (N, N), output 0.". A developer may make a mistake in the format of the input or output, which will cause the program to crash or output incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the number of routes**

The number of routes from (1, 1) to (N, N) is the product of the number of routes from (1, 1) to (i, 1) for all i from 1 to N. A developer may make a mistake in the calculation of the number of routes, which will cause the program to output incorrect results.

**3. Insufficient memory**

The program may need to allocate a large amount of memory to store the data of the obstacles. If the amount of memory is insufficient, the program may crash.

**4. Incorrect handling of edge cases**

The input may contain edge cases, such as N = 1 or M = N * N. A developer may not handle these edge cases correctly, which will cause the program to crash or output incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect use of data structures**

The program may use data structures incorrectly, such as using a linked list to store the obstacles. This may cause the program to crash or output incorrect results.

**6. Incorrect use of algorithms**

The program may use algorithms incorrectly, such as using a brute-force algorithm to calculate the number of routes. This may cause the program to run slowly or output incorrect results.

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain a negative number or a non-integer. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the number of shock waves**

The number of shock waves that hit Count Big Bridge is calculated by multiplying the speed of the shock wave by the time it takes to reach Count Big Bridge and then dividing by the width of the room. However, if the speed of the shock wave is not a multiple of the width of the room, the number of shock waves will be incorrect.

**3. Incorrect handling of reflected shock waves**

The shock waves are reflected off the walls of the room. However, if the shock waves are reflected multiple times, they may hit Count Big Bridge multiple times. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect handling of obstacles**

The shock waves do not disappear due to obstacles such as the launcher itself and Count Big Bridge. However, if the shock waves hit an obstacle, they may be reflected in a different direction. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect handling of multiple shock waves**

The shock waves do not interfere with each other. However, if two shock waves hit Count Big Bridge at the same time, they may be counted as hitting Count Big Bridge multiple times. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

Title:
AIZU p01994 Binary String with Slit

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of slicing**. Slicing is a powerful tool, but it's important to use it correctly. For example, the following code will not work as expected:

```
>>> s = "hello"
>>> s[1:]
'ello'
>>> s[1:2]
'e'
```

The reason this doesn't work is because slicing returns a new string, not a reference to the original string. So, when you change the new string, you're not actually changing the original string.

To fix this, you can either use the `inplace` parameter, or you can use the `replace()` method. For example:

```
>>> s = "hello"
>>> s[1:] = "ello"
>>> s
'hello'
>>> s.replace("l", "o")
'heoeo'
```

2. **Using the wrong data type**. Another common mistake is using the wrong data type. For example, the following code will not work as expected:

```
>>> s = "hello"
>>> len(s)
5
>>> s[0] = "a"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
```

The reason this doesn't work is because strings are immutable, which means you can't change their contents after they've been created. To fix this, you can convert the string to a list, make the changes you need, and then convert the list back to a string. For example:

```
>>> s = "hello"
>>> s = list(s)
>>> s[0] = "a"
>>> s = "".join(s)
>>> s
'aello'
```

3. **Not using the right algorithm**. Sometimes, the best way to solve a problem is to use the right algorithm. For example, the following code will not work as expected:

```
>>> def find_min(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] < nums[i - 1]:
            return nums[i]
    return nums[0]

>>> nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> find_min(nums)
5
```

The reason this doesn't work is because the algorithm is not efficient. It takes O(n) time to find the minimum element, where n is the length of the list. A more efficient algorithm would be to use a binary search, which takes O(log n) time. For example:

```
>>> def find_min(nums):
    low = 0
    high = len(nums) - 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if nums[mid] < nums[mid - 1]:
            return nums[mid]
        elif nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]:
            return nums[mid + 1]
        else:
            if nums[mid] < nums[high]:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
    return nums[0]

>>> nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> find_min(nums)

* **Incorrect output format**. The output for this problem also has a very specific format. If you do not format your output correctly, the program will not be able to evaluate it correctly.
* **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve this problem is not trivial, and it is easy to make a mistake when implementing it. For example, if you forget to account for all of the possible movement options, your algorithm will not be correct.
* **Incorrect data structures**. The data structures used to solve this problem can have a significant impact on the performance of the program. For example, if you use a data structure that is not efficient for the task at hand, your program will run slowly.
* **Incorrect debugging**. Debugging a program that is not working correctly can be very difficult. It is important to use a systematic approach to debugging, and to be patient.

**Possible Bugs**

* **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that can occur when programming. This type of error occurs when you forget to increment or decrement a variable by one, which can lead to incorrect results.
* **Array bounds errors**. Array bounds errors occur when you access an element of an array that is outside of the bounds of the array. This type of error can cause your program to crash or to produce incorrect results.
* **Null pointer errors**. Null pointer errors occur when you try to dereference a pointer that is null. This type of error can cause your program to crash.
* **Arithmetic overflow errors**. Arithmetic overflow errors occur when you perform an arithmetic operation that results in a value that is too large to be represented by the data type. This type of error can cause your program to crash or to produce incorrect results.
* **Logic errors**. Logic errors occur when your program does not behave in the way that you intended it to. This type of error can be very difficult to find and fix.

Title:
AIZU p02428 Enumeration of Subsets II

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type to represent the subsets.**

The subsets are represented as integers in binary. If we use an integer data type to represent the subsets, we will not be able to distinguish between two subsets that have different bit representations but the same decimal representation. For example, the subsets {0, 1} and {1, 0} have the same decimal representation of 2, but they are different sets.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm to enumerate the subsets.**

The most common algorithm for enumerating the subsets is the **breadth-first search** algorithm. This algorithm works by starting with the empty set and then iteratively adding one element at a time to the set. However, this algorithm can be inefficient for large sets, as it can generate a large number of duplicate subsets.

**3. Not handling the case where the input is invalid.**

The input to the problem may be invalid, for example, if the number of elements in the set is greater than the number of elements in the universe. In this case, we need to handle the invalid input gracefully.

**4. Not printing the subsets in the correct order.**

The subsets should be printed in the order of their decimal integers. This can be done by sorting the subsets by their decimal integers before printing them.

**5. Using incorrect formatting for the output.**

The output should be formatted in the following way:

```
d: e_0 e_1 ...
```

where d is the decimal representation of the subset and e_i is the ith element in the subset. The elements in the subset should be printed in ascending order.
