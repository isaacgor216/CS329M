CODECHEF attic

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly handling the input string.** The input string may contain invalid characters, such as non-'#' or non-'.' characters. It is important to check for these characters and handle them appropriately.
2. **Incorrectly calculating the number of days required to cross the passage.** The number of days required to cross the passage is equal to the maximum number of consecutive '.' characters in the input string. It is important to correctly identify these consecutive '.' characters and calculate their number.
3. **Incorrectly handling the case where the maximum number of consecutive '.' characters is greater than the maximum jump length.** In this case, the children will need to practice jumping multiple times in order to cross the passage. It is important to correctly handle this case and calculate the total number of days required to cross the passage.
4. **Incorrectly handling the case where the input string is empty.** In this case, the children will not need to practice jumping at all in order to cross the passage. It is important to correctly handle this case and return 0 as the output.
5. **Incorrectly handling the case where the input string contains only '#' characters.** In this case, the children will not need to practice jumping at all in order to cross the passage. It is important to correctly handle this case and return 0 as the output.

By following these tips, you can avoid the most common problems and bugs when solving this problem.
Test inputs:
```
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    passage = input()
    days = 0
    jump_length = 1
    for i in range(1, len(passage)-1):
        if passage[i] == '.':
            jump_length += 1
        else:
            if jump_length > 1:
                days += 1
                jump_length = 1
    print(days)

Title:
CODECHEF pptest

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of integers, but the developer may accidentally use a different data type, such as strings or floats. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect algorithm**

The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm for solving the problem. This could be due to a mistake in the logic, or a misunderstanding of the problem statement.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

The developer may make an off-by-one error when indexing into the input data or the output array. This could cause the program to produce incorrect results.

**4. Memory leaks**

The developer may accidentally create a memory leak in their program. This could cause the program to run out of memory and crash.

**5. Race conditions**

The developer may create a race condition in their program. This could cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.

**6. Deadlocks**

The developer may create a deadlock in their program. This could cause the program to hang indefinitely.

**7. Security vulnerabilities**

Title:
CODECHEF sumpair

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement asks for the maximum possible sum of all good disjoint pairs that can be made from the given numbers. A disjoint pair is a pair of numbers whose indices in the array are distinct. So, the sum of a disjoint pair is 2 * (the smaller number in the pair).
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The naive solution would be to iterate over all possible pairs of numbers in the array and check if they are disjoint. If they are disjoint, then add their sum to the answer. However, this solution would have a time complexity of O(N^2), which is too slow.
3. **Using a suboptimal data structure.** The naive solution uses a hash map to store the frequencies of each number in the array. This data structure has a time complexity of O(1) for lookups and insertions, but it has a space complexity of O(N). A more efficient data structure would be a sorted array, which has a time complexity of O(log N) for lookups and insertions, but it has a space complexity of O(N).
4. **Using an incorrect algorithm.** The naive solution would iterate over all possible pairs of numbers in the array and check if they are disjoint. However, this solution is not optimal. A better solution would be to use a greedy algorithm that iteratively picks the pair of numbers with the smallest difference that has not been picked yet. This algorithm would have a time complexity of O(N log N).
5. **Not handling edge cases correctly.** The problem statement does not specify what to do if the array is empty or if there are no good pairs of numbers. The naive solution would simply return 0 in these cases, but this is not correct. A better solution would be to throw an exception in these cases.

**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, an error will occur.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors. For example, if the output contains a character that is not a number, an error will occur.
* **Incorrect logic:** The logic of the program may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program does not correctly calculate the number of zeroes, the output will be incorrect.
* **Incorrect implementation:** The program may be incorrectly implemented, which may lead to errors. For example, if the program uses incorrect data structures or algorithms, the output will be incorrect.
* **Incorrect testing:** The program may not be adequately tested, which may lead to errors. For example, if the program is not tested on a variety of inputs, the output may be incorrect for some inputs.

To avoid these problems and bugs, it is important to carefully follow the input and output formats, use the correct logic, correctly implement the program, and adequately test the program.
Test inputs:
**Incorrect input format:**

```
4 3 1
abc
```

This input is incorrect because the number of variables (3) does not match the number of values in the input (4).

**Incorrect output format:**

```
4 3 1
13 10 6
AXoA
2
```

This output is incorrect because it does not have the correct number of lines. The output should have 1 line, but this output has 2 lines.

**Incorrect logic:**

```
def get_number_of_zeroes(arr, gate):
    number_of_zeroes = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):
            current_val = 0
            for k in range(len(gate)):
                if gate[k] == 'A':
                    current_val = current_val & (arr[i][k] & arr[j][k])
                elif gate[k] == 'O':
                    current_val = current_val | (arr[i][k] | arr[j][k])
                elif gate[k] == 'X':
                    current_val = current_val ^ (arr[i][k] ^ arr[j][k])
                elif gate[k] == 'a':
                    current_val = current_val & ~(arr[i][k] | arr[j][k])
                elif gate[k] == 'o':
                    current_val = current_val | ~(arr[i][k] & arr[j][k])
                elif gate[k] == 'x':
                    current_val = current_val ^ ~(arr[i][k] ^ arr[j][k])
            if current_val == 0:
                number_of_zeroes += 1
    return number_of_zeroes
```

This code is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the number of zeroes. For example, if the input is `4 3 1` and the gate is `AXoA`, the output should be `3`, but this code returns `2`.

**Incorrect implementation:**

```
def main():
    w, n, m = map(int, input().split())
    arr = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    
    gates = []
    for i in range(m):
        gates.append(input())
    
    for gate in gates:
        print(get_number_of_zeroes(arr, gate))
        

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where the number of gates is greater than the number of variables. For example, if the input is `4 3 5`, the code will raise an error.

**Incorrect testing:**

The program is not adequately tested. For example, the program is not tested on inputs that are not in the correct format.

Here are some program inputs that will validate whether an implementation meets each of the requirements listed above:

* **Incorrect input format:**

```
4 3 1
abc
```

* **Incorrect output format:**

```
4 3 1
13 10 6

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of pointers**. When using pointers, it is important to make sure that they are pointing to valid memory locations. A common mistake is to dereference a pointer that has not been initialized, which will result in a segmentation fault.
2. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when a programmer forgets to account for the first or last element in an array or list. This can lead to incorrect results or even a segmentation fault.
3. **Array bounds errors**. Array bounds errors occur when a programmer accesses an element of an array that is outside of the bounds of the array. This can also lead to a segmentation fault.
4. **Incorrect use of loops**. When using loops, it is important to make sure that the loop condition is correct and that the loop body is executed the correct number of times. A common mistake is to forget to increment or decrement the loop counter, which can lead to an infinite loop or incorrect results.
5. **Incorrect use of functions**. When calling a function, it is important to make sure that the function is passed the correct arguments and that the function is used correctly. A common mistake is to pass a function an argument that is of the wrong type or to call a function with the wrong number of arguments.
6. **Incorrect use of data structures**. When using data structures, it is important to make sure that the data structure is used correctly. A common mistake is to use a data structure in a way that is not supported by the data structure's interface.
7. **Logic errors**. Logic errors occur when a programmer makes a mistake in the logic of their program. This can lead to incorrect results or even a program that does not work at all.
8. **User errors**. User errors occur when a user enters incorrect input into a program. This can lead to incorrect results or even a program that does not work at all.
9. **Unexpected errors**. Unexpected errors can occur due to a variety of reasons, such as hardware failure, software bugs, or natural disasters. These errors can be difficult to debug and can sometimes lead to a program that does not work at all.

CODEFORCES 1186_E. Vus the Cossack and a Field

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format of the problem is not strictly defined. For example, the input may contain spaces between numbers, or the numbers may be separated by commas, or the numbers may be enclosed in quotes. This can lead to errors in the parsing of the input data and incorrect results.

To avoid this problem, make sure that the input data is strictly in the format specified in the problem statement.

### 2. Incorrect output format

The output format of the problem is also not strictly defined. For example, the output may contain spaces between numbers, or the numbers may be separated by commas, or the numbers may be enclosed in quotes. This can lead to errors in the parsing of the output data and incorrect results.

To avoid this problem, make sure that the output data is strictly in the format specified in the problem statement.

### 3. Incorrect calculation of the sum of the numbers in the submatrix

The sum of the numbers in the submatrix can be calculated in different ways. For example, you can iterate over all the cells in the submatrix and add the values of the cells to the sum. Or, you can use a formula to calculate the sum of the numbers in the submatrix.

To avoid errors in the calculation of the sum of the numbers in the submatrix, make sure that you use the correct method for calculating the sum.

### 4. Incorrect handling of overflows

When calculating the sum of the numbers in the submatrix, it is possible to encounter overflows. This can happen if the sum of the numbers in the submatrix is too large.

To avoid overflows, make sure that the sum of the numbers in the submatrix does not exceed the maximum value that can be represented by the data type that you are using.

### 5. Incorrect use of pointers

When working with arrays, it is important to use pointers correctly. For example, you should not dereference a pointer that is not pointing to a valid memory location.

To avoid errors in the use of pointers, make sure that you understand the difference between a pointer and a reference, and that you use pointers correctly.

### 6. Incorrect use of dynamic memory allocation

When working with dynamic memory allocation, it is important to free the memory that you allocate when you are finished with it. If you do not free the memory, it can lead to memory leaks.

To avoid memory leaks, make sure that you free the memory that you allocate when you are finished with it.

### 7. Incorrect use of multithreading

When working with multithreading, it is important to synchronize the access to shared data. If you do not synchronize the access to shared data, it can lead to race conditions.

To avoid race conditions, make sure that you synchronize the access to shared data.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that each line of output should contain three integers u, v, and x, where u and v are the two endpoints of an edge in the tree and x is the weight of the edge. If the output format is not correct, the program will not be able to correctly output the solution and will receive a negative score.
3. **Incorrect edge weights**. The problem statement specifies that the edge weights must be non-negative integers. If any of the edge weights are negative or non-integer, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem and will receive a negative score.
4. **Incorrect solution**. The problem statement specifies that the sum of all edge weights must be less than or equal to ⌊(2n^2)/9⌋. If the sum of all edge weights is greater than ⌊(2n^2)/9⌋, the program will not be able to correctly solve the problem and will receive a negative score.
5. **Memory limit exceeded**. The program must not exceed the memory limit specified in the problem statement. If the program exceeds the memory limit, it will be terminated and will receive a negative score.
6. **Time limit exceeded**. The program must not exceed the time limit specified in the problem statement. If the program exceeds the time limit, it will be terminated and will receive a negative score.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement and input format. It is also important to test your program thoroughly to ensure that it produces the correct output for all possible inputs.

CODEFORCES 1223_A. CME

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format must be followed exactly, or the program will not produce the correct output. For example, if the output contains a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the output correctly.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are common in programming, and can lead to incorrect results. For example, if a program is supposed to add two numbers, but it adds one number too many, the result will be incorrect.
4. **Array out-of-bounds errors**. Array out-of-bounds errors occur when a program tries to access an element of an array that does not exist. For example, if a program tries to access the element at index 10 of an array that only has 9 elements, the program will crash.
5. **Null pointer exceptions**. Null pointer exceptions occur when a program tries to access a null pointer. For example, if a program tries to dereference a variable that has been set to null, the program will crash.
6. **Divide by zero errors**. Divide by zero errors occur when a program tries to divide by zero. For example, if a program tries to divide a number by zero, the program will crash.
7. **Arithmetic overflow errors**. Arithmetic overflow errors occur when a program tries to perform an arithmetic operation that results in a number that is too large to represent. For example, if a program tries to add two numbers that are both greater than 2^31 - 1, the program will crash.
8. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when a program allocates memory that is never freed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
9. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even crashes.
10. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This can prevent any of the threads from making progress and eventually lead to a crash.

2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correct. For example, the output may not contain a single integer, or the output may contain more than two integers.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm may not be correct. For example, the algorithm may not find the maximum possible beauty of the string, or the algorithm may not find the correct indices of the two characters to swap.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. The implementation of the algorithm may not be correct. For example, the implementation may contain syntax errors, or the implementation may not be efficient.
5. **Incorrect testing**. The testing of the algorithm may not be correct. For example, the testing may not test all possible cases, or the testing may not test the edge cases.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to design and implement the algorithm carefully and test it thoroughly.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a non-empty string of uppercase English letters of length at most 3 ⋅ 10^5. Each letter represents a ball with the corresponding color. If the input format is incorrect, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer that represents the number of ways to choose a color and a position of a new ball in order to eliminate all the balls. If the output format is incorrect, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The program should iterate over the input string and check if any segment of balls of the same color has length at least 3. If such a segment exists, the program should increment the number of ways to eliminate all the balls. If no such segment exists, the program should output 0.
4. **Memory leaks.** The program should not allocate any memory that is not freed after it is used. If the program does not free the allocated memory, it will eventually run out of memory and crash.
5. **Time complexity.** The program should run in O(n) time, where n is the length of the input string. If the program runs in more than O(n) time, it will be too slow for large input strings.

Title:
CODEFORCES 130_D. Exponentiation

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**

The most common mistake is to use the wrong modulo operator. For example, you might accidentally use `%` instead of `mod()`. This will cause your code to produce incorrect results.

**2. Using the wrong base or exponent**

Another common mistake is to use the wrong base or exponent. For example, you might accidentally use `a^b` instead of `a**b`. This will also cause your code to produce incorrect results.

**3. Not handling negative numbers correctly**

The exponentiation algorithm does not work correctly for negative numbers. For example, `a**-1` is not equal to `1 / a`. If you need to exponentiate a negative number, you will need to use a different algorithm.

**4. Not handling large numbers correctly**

The exponentiation algorithm can be slow for large numbers. If you need to exponentiate a large number, you may need to use a different algorithm or a different programming language.

**5. Not handling overflows correctly**

The exponentiation algorithm can overflow for large numbers. If you need to exponentiate a large number, you may need to use a different algorithm or a different programming language.

**6. Not handling division by zero correctly**

The exponentiation algorithm does not work correctly for division by zero. If you need to divide by zero, you will need to use a different algorithm.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1352_B. Same Parity Summands

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is of type `int`, which can only store integers up to `2^31 - 1`. This means that if `n` is larger than this value, the program will overflow and produce incorrect results.

To avoid this problem, we can use the `long` data type, which can store integers up to `2^63 - 1`.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The naive algorithm for solving this problem is to try every possible combination of k positive integers that sum to n. This algorithm has a time complexity of `O(n^k)`, which is prohibitively slow for large values of n and k.

A more efficient algorithm is to use the following fact: if n is even, then it can be written as the sum of k even integers; if n is odd, then it can be written as the sum of k + 1 odd integers.

This algorithm has a time complexity of `O(k log n)`, which is much faster than the naive algorithm.

**3. Not handling special cases correctly**

The input data may contain special cases that the program must handle correctly. For example, if `n` is 0, then the answer is `YES` and the summands are all 0. If `k` is 0, then the answer is `NO`.

The program must be careful to handle these special cases correctly.

**4. Using incorrect variable names**

The program must use descriptive variable names to make it easy to understand what the code is doing. For example, the variable `n` should be used to store the number of summands, and the variable `k` should be used to store the number of positive integers.

Using incorrect variable names can make the code difficult to read and understand, and it can also lead to errors.

**5. Not commenting the code**

The program should be well-commented to make it easy for other developers to understand what the code is doing. The comments should explain the purpose of each function, and they should also explain the logic of the program.

Not commenting the code can make it difficult for other developers to understand what the code is doing, and it can also lead to errors.

**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format is not correct. For example, the input may not have two integers n and q, or the string s may not contain only characters "<" and ">".
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format is not correct. For example, the output may not have q lines, or the numbers in the output may not be integers.
* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm:** The algorithm may not be correct. For example, the algorithm may not find the maximum number of balls in one hole.
* **Incorrect handling of edge cases:** The algorithm may not handle edge cases correctly. For example, the algorithm may not work correctly if n is 1 or q is 0.
* **Memory leaks:** The algorithm may not free up memory after it is finished using it. This can lead to a memory leak.
* **Synchronization issues:** The algorithm may not be thread-safe. This can lead to incorrect results if multiple threads are accessing the same data at the same time.

If the input is a single integer, then the code should handle the case where the integer is negative or non-integer. If the input is a list of integers, then the code should handle the case where the list is empty or contains non-integers.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format for this problem is not very clear. It is not clear whether the output should be a single integer or a list of integers. If the output is a single integer, then the code should handle the case where the integer is negative or non-integer. If the output is a list of integers, then the code should handle the case where the list is empty or contains non-integers.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of nice staircases**. The code should correctly calculate the number of nice staircases that can be built using the given number of cells.

CODEFORCES 1437_B. Reverse Binary Strings

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct.**

The input format of the problem is:

```
The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; n is even) — the length of string s.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string s of length n (s_i ∈ {0, 1}). String s has exactly n/2 zeroes and n/2 ones.

It's guaranteed that the total sum of n over test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.
```

But the following input is not correct:

```

```

The input should be `2` instead of `22`.

**2. The output format is not correct.**

The output format of the problem is:

```
For each test case, print the minimum number of operations to make s alternating.
```

But the following output is not correct:

```
1

2
```

The output should be `0`, `1`, and `2`.

**3. The solution is not correct.**

The following solution is not correct:

```
def solve(n):
    if n % 2 == 1:
        return -1
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] != s[i + 1]:
            count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(solve(n))
```

The solution should return the minimum number of operations to make `s` alternating. But the above solution returns `-1` if `n % 2 == 1`. This is not correct.

CODEFORCES 1487_A. Arena

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the dynamic programming algorithm.** The dynamic programming algorithm for this problem is relatively straightforward, but it is easy to make mistakes when implementing it. One common mistake is to forget to update the dp table when a new hero enters the arena. Another common mistake is to incorrectly calculate the number of possible winners for a given state of the arena.
2. **Incorrect handling of ties.** In the problem statement, it is specified that when two heroes of equal levels fight, nobody wins the fight. However, it is possible that two heroes of equal levels could win the tournament if they both win the same number of fights. It is important to handle this case correctly in your implementation.
3. **Incorrect handling of the base case.** The base case for the dynamic programming algorithm is when there is only one hero in the arena. In this case, the only possible winner is the hero that is already in the arena. It is important to handle this case correctly in your implementation.
4. **Incorrect handling of the overflow.** The problem states that the winner of the tournament is the first hero that wins in at least 100^{500} fights. This means that the number of possible winners could be very large. It is important to handle this case correctly in your implementation, or you may get an incorrect answer.
5. **Incorrect use of the dp table.** The dp table is used to store the number of possible winners for each state of the arena. It is important to use the dp table correctly in your implementation, or you may get an incorrect answer.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem states that Izzy's goal is to have at most 1.3⋅ b + 100 wrong predictions after all those wagers, where b is the smallest number of wrong predictions that any other wager participant will have after all those wagers. However, some developers may incorrectly assume that Izzy's goal is to have the fewest number of wrong predictions possible. This could lead to a solution that makes more than 1.3⋅ b + 100 wrong predictions, which would be incorrect.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for finding the smallest number of wrong predictions that any other wager participant will have after all those wagers is not trivial. Some developers may incorrectly implement the algorithm, which could lead to a solution that makes more than 1.3⋅ b + 100 wrong predictions, which would be incorrect.
3. **Incorrect input handling.** The problem states that the input will consist of two integers n and m, followed by m wagers. Each wager will consist of a string of n 0s and 1s, followed by the actual outcome of the wager. Some developers may incorrectly handle the input, which could lead to a solution that does not work correctly.
4. **Incorrect output handling.** The problem states that the output must consist of Izzy's guess for each wager, followed by the actual outcome of the wager. Some developers may incorrectly handle the output, which could lead to a solution that does not work correctly.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The problem does not specify what should happen if an error occurs. Some developers may incorrectly handle errors, which could lead to a solution that does not work correctly.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement, and to correctly implement the algorithm. It is also important to carefully handle the input and output, and to correctly handle errors.

4. **Memory leaks.** The developer may not properly free memory that is allocated during the execution of the program, which could lead to memory leaks. Memory leaks can cause the program to run slowly or crash.
5. **Race conditions.** The developer may not properly synchronize access to shared data, which could lead to race conditions. Race conditions can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
6. **Deadlocks.** The developer may not properly handle deadlocks, which can cause the program to hang or crash. Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, and neither thread can proceed.
7. **Security vulnerabilities.** The developer may not properly implement security features, which could lead to security vulnerabilities. Security vulnerabilities can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or its data.
8. **Unmaintainable code.** The developer may not write code that is easy to maintain, which could make it difficult to fix bugs or add new features. Unmaintainable code can also make it difficult to understand the program, which can lead to errors.
9. **Undocumented code.** The developer may not document the code properly, which could make it difficult for other developers to understand the program. Undocumented code can also make it difficult to fix bugs or add new features.
10. **Overly complex code.** The developer may write code that is too complex, which can make it difficult to understand and maintain. Overly complex code can also make it more difficult to find and fix bugs.

Title:
CODEFORCES 164_C. Machine Programming

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is two integers n and k, followed by n lines of three integers si, ti, and ci. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm used to solve this problem must be correct in order to produce the correct output. A common mistake is to assume that the tasks can be completed in any order. This is not true, as the tasks must be completed in such a way that no machine is ever idle.

**3. Incorrect implementation**

The implementation of the algorithm must be correct in order to produce the correct output. A common mistake is to make a mistake in the code, such as using the wrong variable or forgetting to initialize a variable.

**4. Runtime error**

The program must be able to run to completion in a reasonable amount of time. A common mistake is to use an inefficient algorithm or to implement the algorithm in a way that is not cache-friendly.

**5. Memory error**

The program must not use more memory than is available. A common mistake is to allocate too much memory or to use a data structure that is too large.

**6. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is n integers x1, x2, ..., xn. Each xi must be either 0 or 1, indicating whether or not the corresponding task should be completed. A common mistake is to output the wrong number of integers or to output integers that are not in the correct range.

Title:
CODEFORCES 185_D. Visit of the Great

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input specifies that the values of `ki`, `li`, `ri` and `pi` can be up to 10^18, but the problem statement also specifies that we should not use the `%lld` specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. This means that we need to use a different data type to store these values. One option would be to use the `long long` data type, which is guaranteed to be able to store values up to 2^63-1. Another option would be to use the `__int128` data type, which is guaranteed to be able to store values up to 2^128-1.

**2. Using the wrong formula for LCM**

The formula for LCM is `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b)`, where `gcd(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`. In this problem, we need to find the LCM of a set of numbers, so we can use the following formula:

```
LCM(a1, a2, ..., an) = (a1 * a2 * ... * an) / (gcd(a1, a2) * gcd(a1, a3) * ... * gcd(an-1, an))
```

**3. Not handling the case where `pi` is not prime**

The problem statement specifies that `pi` is prime, but it is possible for a user to input a value of `pi` that is not prime. In this case, the solution will not work correctly. One way to handle this case is to check if `pi` is prime before using it in the formula for LCM. Another way to handle this case is to use a different formula for LCM that does not require `pi` to be prime.

**4. Not handling the case where `ki` is not a factor of `LCM(k2l+1, k2l+1+1, ..., k2r+1)`**

The problem statement specifies that only the dwarves who can see the Great Mushroom King are counted in the LCM. This means that if `ki` is not a factor of `LCM(k2l+1, k2l+1+1, ..., k2r+1)`, then the answer will be 0. One way to handle this case is to check if `ki` is a factor of `LCM(k2l+1, k2l+1+1, ..., k2r+1)` before using it in the formula for LCM. Another way to handle this case is to use a different formula for LCM that does not require `ki` to be a factor of `LCM(k2l+1, k2l+1+1, ..., k2r+1)`.

**5. Not handling the case where `li` is negative**

The problem statement does not specify what to do if `li` is negative. One way to handle this case is to ignore `li` and use `0` instead. Another way to handle this case is to use a different formula for LCM that does not require `li` to be non-negative.

        for (int j = li; j <= ri; j++) {
            lcm = (lcm * (ki * ki + 1)) / __gcd(lcm, (ki * ki + 1));

Title:
CODEFORCES 280_D. k-Maximum Subsequence Sum

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

When dealing with integers, it is important to use the correct data type. For example, if you are working with numbers that are larger than 2^31-1, you will need to use a 64-bit integer type. Otherwise, you may encounter errors due to overflow.

**2. Using incorrect algorithms**

There are many different algorithms for solving different problems. It is important to choose the right algorithm for the problem you are trying to solve. For example, if you are trying to find the maximum sum of a subarray, you should use a dynamic programming algorithm. Otherwise, you may not find the optimal solution.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

When writing code, it is important to handle edge cases. For example, if you are writing code to sort a list of numbers, you need to handle the case where the list is empty. Otherwise, your code will crash.

**4. Not testing your code**

Before you deploy your code to production, it is important to test it thoroughly. This will help you to catch bugs and ensure that your code is working correctly.

**5. Not using version control**

Version control is a system that tracks changes to your code over time. This can be very helpful if you need to roll back to a previous version of your code. It can also be helpful if you need to collaborate with other developers on a project.

Title:
CODEFORCES 303_C. Minimum Modular

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains integers in the range [0, 10^6]. If we use an integer data type to store the numbers, we may get overflow errors. To avoid this, we can use a long long data type.

**2. Not handling the case where k = n**

The problem statement says that we can remove at most k of the integers. If k = n, then we can remove all of the integers, and the answer is 0. We need to make sure to handle this case correctly.

**3. Not considering the case where all of the integers are equal**

The problem statement says that the integers are distinct. However, it is possible that all of the integers are equal. In this case, the answer is the smallest integer that is greater than all of the given integers.

**4. Not using the greedy algorithm**

The greedy algorithm is a simple and efficient algorithm that can be used to solve this problem. The algorithm works by repeatedly choosing the integer that has the smallest absolute value and removing it. This process is repeated until k integers have been removed. The answer is the smallest integer that is greater than all of the remaining integers.

**5. Not handling the edge cases**

There are a few edge cases that need to be handled when solving this problem. For example, we need to handle the case where the input is empty. We also need to handle the case where all of the integers are equal.

Title:
CODEFORCES 32_D. Constellation

Pain points:
**Most Important Possible Problems and Bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Off-by-one errors.** Be careful when iterating over the rows and columns of the map, as it's easy to make a mistake and miss a star or count it twice.
2. **Incorrect indexing.** Make sure that you're using the correct indices when accessing the elements of the map. For example, if the map is represented as a 2D array, the element at row i and column j would be accessed using map[i][j].
3. **Incorrect logic.** Make sure that your algorithm is correct. For example, if you're trying to find the smallest element in an array, you need to make sure that you're checking all of the elements, not just the first few.
4. **Memory errors.** Be careful not to allocate too much memory, as this can cause your program to crash.
5. **Timeout errors.** Make sure that your algorithm is efficient enough to run within the time limit.

Here are some specific examples of problems that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer might forget to check for the edge cases, such as a map with no stars or a map with only one star.
* The developer might use the wrong data type to represent the map, which could lead to errors when iterating over the rows and columns.
* The developer might use an incorrect algorithm to find the constellation, which could lead to incorrect results.
* The developer might not handle memory allocation properly, which could lead to a memory leak or a segmentation fault.
* The developer might not write efficient code, which could cause the program to run too slowly and time out.

By being aware of these potential problems, developers can avoid them and write code that is correct, efficient, and runs within the time limit.

CODEFORCES 351_B. Jeff and Furik

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific. It expects a single line containing the integer `n` followed by a newline, then another line containing `n` space-separated integers. If the input format is not correct, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output for this problem should be a single floating-point number that represents the minimum mathematical expectation of the number of moves in the game. The output should be rounded to 6 decimal places. If the output format is not correct, the program will not be accepted by the judge.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve this problem must be correct in order to produce the correct output. There are a number of different ways to solve this problem, but not all of them are correct. Make sure that your algorithm is correct before submitting your solution.
4. **Incorrect implementation**. Even if your algorithm is correct, it must be implemented correctly in order to produce the correct output. Pay attention to details such as variable types, data structures, and error handling. A small mistake in your implementation can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
5. **Runtime errors**. The program must be able to run to completion in a reasonable amount of time. If the program takes too long to run, it will be disqualified by the judge. Make sure that your algorithm is efficient and that your implementation is well-optimized.

Title:
CODEFORCES 375_C. Circling Round Treasures

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, if you forget to include a newline character between two lines of input, the program will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output for this problem should be a single integer, representing the maximum possible profit. If you output anything else, the program will likely crash.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm you use to solve this problem must be correct, or the program will not produce the correct output. For example, if you try to use a brute-force algorithm to solve this problem, it will likely take a very long time to run.
4. **Incorrect data structures**. The data structures you use to solve this problem must be appropriate for the task at hand. For example, if you try to use a linked list to store the path of cells you've visited, it will likely take a very long time to traverse the list.
5. **Incorrect error handling**. It's important to handle errors gracefully in your program. For example, if you try to access a cell that doesn't exist in the map, the program should crash.
6. **Incorrect debugging**. If your program is not working correctly, it's important to be able to debug it effectively. For example, you can use a debugger to step through your program and see where it's going wrong.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

* Carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand the input and output formats.
* Test your program with a variety of input data to make sure it's working correctly.
* Use a debugger to help you track down errors in your program.
* Use appropriate data structures for the task at hand.
* Handle errors gracefully.
* Compile your code with the -Wall flag to enable all compiler warnings.

Title:
CODEFORCES 397_E. On Changing Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the segment tree.** The segment tree is a data structure that can be used to answer range queries on a set of numbers. In this problem, we can use a segment tree to store the values of the vertices in the tree. When we receive a query of type 1, we can update the values of the vertices in the segment tree that are descendants of the vertex v. When we receive a query of type 2, we can find the value of the vertex v in the segment tree.

There are a few common mistakes that people make when implementing the segment tree. One common mistake is to use the wrong type of data structure for the segment tree. The segment tree should be implemented using a balanced binary tree, such as a red-black tree or an AVL tree. Another common mistake is to not update the segment tree correctly when we receive a query of type 1. We need to make sure to update all of the vertices in the segment tree that are descendants of the vertex v.

2. **Incorrect implementation of the DFS.** The DFS (depth-first search) algorithm is a recursive algorithm that can be used to traverse a graph. In this problem, we can use DFS to find the descendants of a vertex in the tree. When we receive a query of type 1, we can use DFS to find all of the descendants of the vertex v. We can then update the values of the vertices in the segment tree that are descendants of the vertex v.

There are a few common mistakes that people make when implementing DFS. One common mistake is to not mark the vertices that have already been visited. This can lead to the DFS algorithm getting stuck in an infinite loop. Another common mistake is to not update the state of the vertices as they are visited. This can lead to the DFS algorithm not finding all of the descendants of the vertex v.

3. **Incorrect implementation of the modular arithmetic.** Modular arithmetic is a branch of mathematics that deals with arithmetic operations performed on numbers that are taken modulo a fixed integer. In this problem, we need to perform modular arithmetic when we add and subtract the values of the vertices in the tree. We need to make sure that we use the correct modulus when we perform these operations.

There are a few common mistakes that people make when implementing modular arithmetic. One common mistake is to use the wrong modulus. The modulus should be a prime number. Another common mistake is to not reduce the results of the arithmetic operations modulo the modulus. This can lead to the results being incorrect.

4. **Incorrect implementation of the input and output.** The input and output for this problem are a bit tricky. The input consists of a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of a vertex in the tree. The output consists of a list of integers, where each integer represents the value of a vertex in the tree.

There are a few common mistakes that people make when implementing the input and output. One common mistake is to not read the input correctly. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output. Another common mistake is to not write the output correctly. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 468_E. Permanent

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not very strict. It only requires that the first line contains two space-separated integers n, k and the next k lines contain the description of the matrix. However, some developers may make mistakes when parsing the input. For example, they may forget to check if the input is valid or they may not handle the case where k is 0.

**2. Incorrect calculation of the permanent**

The permanent of a matrix is a very difficult problem to solve. There are no known polynomial-time algorithms for computing the permanent of a matrix. The most common approach is to use the determinant of the matrix. However, this approach is not always correct. For example, if the matrix is singular, then the determinant will be zero, even though the permanent may be non-zero.

**3. Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic**

The output of the problem must be modulo 1000000007. Some developers may forget to do this and their output will be incorrect.

**4. Overflow errors**

The numbers in the problem can be very large. Some developers may not handle these numbers correctly and their code will overflow.

**5. Runtime errors**

The problem has a time limit of 1 second. Some developers may write code that is too slow and their code will not finish running before the time limit expires.

Title:
CODEFORCES 490_E. Restoring Increasing Sequence

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that each element of the sequence must consist only of digits and question marks, and that no element starts with a 0. A developer may incorrectly parse the input and miss or misinterpret these requirements, resulting in an incorrect solution.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution**. The solution must find a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers that can be transformed from the given sequence by replacing each question mark with a single digit. A developer may incorrectly implement the solution, resulting in a sequence that is not strictly increasing or that cannot be transformed from the given sequence.
3. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the first line of the output must contain the string "YES" or "NO". The following lines must contain the sequence of positive integers that is the solution to the problem. A developer may incorrectly format the output, resulting in a solution that is not accepted by the judge.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. The problem statement specifies several edge cases, such as the case where the input sequence is empty or the case where the input sequence contains only question marks. A developer must handle these edge cases correctly, or the solution may not be correct.
5. **Insufficient testing**. A developer should always test their code thoroughly before submitting it to a competition. This includes testing the code on a variety of input data, including both correct and incorrect input. By testing the code thoroughly, a developer can catch bugs and errors before they cause problems in a competition.

Title:
CODEFORCES 514_E. Darth Vader and Tree

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to incorrect parsing of the input data. For example, if the input contains a space after the first integer, the program may incorrectly parse the number of nodes and children.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of nodes**. The number of nodes can be calculated in different ways, and some of them may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the tree is not rooted, the number of nodes at a given distance from the root may be different from the number of nodes at the same distance from any other node.
3. **Incorrect modulo operation**. The modulo operation is a common source of errors in programming. It is important to make sure that the operands of the modulo operation are of the same type and that the result is within the range of the modulo operation. For example, if the input data is a large number, the modulo operation may overflow and return an incorrect result.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed, which may lead to the program being rejected by the judge. For example, if the output contains a newline character after the last integer, the program may be rejected.
5. **Other errors**. There are many other possible errors that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. Some of the most common ones include:
    * Using incorrect data types
    * Using incorrect algorithms
    * Making logical errors
    * Not handling errors correctly

To avoid these errors, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the program thoroughly with a variety of input data.

Title:
CODEFORCES 58_E. Expression

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a string of the form `a + b = c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If the input is not in this format, the program will crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a string of the form `x + y = z`, where `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If the output is not in this format, the program will crash.
3. **Incorrect calculation of `x`, `y`, and `z`.** The program must calculate `x`, `y`, and `z` such that `x + y = z` and the expression `a + b = c` is met as a subsequence. If the program does not calculate `x`, `y`, and `z` correctly, the output will be incorrect.
4. **Incorrect choice of the shortest possible expression.** The program must print the expression `x + y = z` with the shortest possible length. If the program does not print the shortest possible expression, the output will not be optimal.
5. **Incorrect handling of ties.** If there are multiple expressions `x + y = z` that meet the criteria, the program must print any one of them. If the program does not print any of the expressions, the output will be incorrect.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully check the input format and make sure that your program correctly calculates `x`, `y`, and `z`. You should also make sure that your program prints the shortest possible expression and handles ties correctly.

Title:
CODEFORCES 631_D. Messenger

Pain points:
Here are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format specified in the problem statement is not always followed by the test cases. For example, the first line of the input may contain more than two integers, or the second line may not contain any data. The developer should check the input format carefully and handle any errors gracefully.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format specified in the problem statement is not always followed by the test cases. For example, the output may contain more than one integer, or it may not be a valid integer. The developer should check the output format carefully and handle any errors gracefully.
* **Incorrect data:** The data given in the test cases may be incorrect. For example, the length of a string may be negative, or a string may contain non-lowercase English letters. The developer should check the data carefully and handle any errors gracefully.
* **Off-by-one errors:** The developer may make off-by-one errors when calculating the number of occurrences of a substring in a string. For example, the developer may forget to include the first character of the substring in the count, or the developer may count the last character of the substring twice. The developer should carefully check their code for off-by-one errors.
* **Memory leaks:** The developer may create memory leaks when allocating and freeing memory. For example, the developer may forget to free a memory block after it is no longer needed, or the developer may allocate a memory block that is too large. The developer should carefully check their code for memory leaks.
* **Race conditions:** The developer may create race conditions when multiple threads access the same data simultaneously. For example, the developer may not use mutexes to protect shared data, or the developer may not use atomic operations to ensure that the data is accessed atomically. The developer should carefully check their code for race conditions.
* **Deadlocks:** The developer may create deadlocks when multiple threads wait for each other to release a lock. For example, the developer may use a circular wait condition, or the developer may not release a lock after it is no longer needed. The developer should carefully check their code for deadlocks.

CODEFORCES 660_B. Seating On Bus

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be two integers, n and m, separated by a space. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to process the input and will produce an error.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data should be two integers. If the input data is not an integer, the program will not be able to process the input and will produce an error.
3. **Insufficient memory**. If the number of passengers is greater than the capacity of the bus, the program will not be able to allocate enough memory to store the data and will produce an error.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The program may incorrectly calculate the number of passengers who will get off the bus in each row, resulting in the passengers getting off in the wrong order.
5. **Logic errors**. The program may contain logic errors that cause it to produce incorrect output.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully check the input format and data type of the input data, and to ensure that the program has enough memory to store the data. It is also important to carefully check the logic of the program to ensure that it is correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 683_F. Reformat the String

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly handling punctuation marks.** The problem states that there should be a space immediately after a dot or a comma in the case that there is a word after that dot or comma. However, some solutions incorrectly insert a space after a dot or comma even if there is no word after it. This can result in the output string being incorrect.
2. **Incorrectly capitalizing words.** The problem states that all letters must be lowercase, except all first letters in the first words of the sentences. However, some solutions incorrectly capitalize all words, or incorrectly capitalize words that are not the first word of a sentence. This can result in the output string being incorrect.
3. **Incorrectly handling strings that start with a space.** The problem states that the string must not start with a space. However, some solutions incorrectly remove the space from the beginning of the string. This can result in the output string being incorrect.
4. **Incorrectly handling strings that end with a punctuation mark.** The problem states that there should be a space immediately after a dot or a comma in the case that there is a word after that dot or comma. However, some solutions incorrectly insert a space after a dot or comma even if there is no word after it. This can result in the output string being incorrect.
5. **Incorrectly handling strings that contain multiple spaces.** The problem states that there should be exactly one space between any two consecutive words. However, some solutions incorrectly insert multiple spaces between words. This can result in the output string being incorrect.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the requirements. It is also important to test your solution on a variety of input strings to ensure that it is correct.

Title:
CODEFORCES 706_E. Working routine

Pain points:
```
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when entering the data. For example, if you forget to put a space between two numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** When swapping two submatrices, it's important to make sure that you're swapping the correct rows and columns. A common mistake is to swap the rows or columns of the first matrix with the rows or columns of the second matrix.
3. **Indexing errors.** When iterating over the rows and columns of the matrix, it's important to make sure that you're using the correct indices. For example, if you're trying to access the element in the first row and second column, you need to use the index (0, 1) instead of (1, 0).
4. **Memory errors.** If you're not careful, you can easily run out of memory when solving this problem. This is especially true if the matrix is large or if you're performing a lot of swaps.
5. **Time complexity.** The time complexity of the naive solution to this problem is O(n^2 * m^2 * q), which is prohibitively slow for large inputs. To improve the time complexity, you can use a more efficient algorithm, such as a divide-and-conquer algorithm.
6. **Incorrect output.** When printing the output, it's important to make sure that you're formatting the data correctly. For example, you need to make sure that each row is on a separate line and that each number is separated by a space.

Title:
CODEFORCES 74_C. Chessboard Billiard

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains two integers n and m, which can be very large. If you use the wrong data type, such as int, your program may overflow and give incorrect results.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The problem asks for the maximum number of billiard balls that do not pairwise beat each other. A naive approach is to try all possible arrangements of billiard balls and check if they do not pairwise beat each other. This approach is exponential in time and will not work for large n and m.

A more efficient approach is to use dynamic programming. We can define a table T[i][j] to be the maximum number of billiard balls that can be placed on a chessboard of size i × j such that no two billiard balls beat each other. We can then fill in the table row by row, starting with the base case T[1][1] = 1.

**3. Incorrect boundary conditions**

The problem states that n and m must be at least 2. If you do not check for this, your program may crash or give incorrect results.

**4. Off-by-one errors**

When computing the values in the table T[i][j], it is important to make sure that you are not off by one. For example, if you are computing T[i][j] and you have already computed T[i - 1][j], you need to make sure that you add 1 to T[i][j] instead of just copying the value of T[i - 1][j].

**5. Using uninitialized variables**

It is important to initialize all variables before using them. For example, if you declare a variable x and then try to use it without initializing it, your program may crash or give incorrect results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 798_A. Mike and palindrome

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly checking if a string is a palindrome.** A common mistake is to check if a string is a palindrome by simply reversing it and comparing it to the original string. This will not work if the string contains any non-alphabetic characters. A correct way to check if a string is a palindrome is to use a two-pointer approach. Start with the two pointers at the beginning and end of the string, and move them inwards until they meet. If the characters at each position are the same, the string is a palindrome. Otherwise, it is not.
2. **Not considering all possible cases.** When solving a problem, it is important to consider all possible cases. For example, in this problem, we need to consider the case where the string is already a palindrome. In this case, we cannot change any characters and the answer is "NO".
3. **Using incorrect data types.** When working with strings, it is important to use the correct data type. In this problem, we need to use a string data type to store the input string. Using an integer or floating-point data type will not work.
4. **Making off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that occurs when counting or indexing. In this problem, we need to be careful not to make off-by-one errors when checking if the string is a palindrome or when changing a character in the string.
5. **Using inefficient algorithms.** When solving a problem, it is important to use an efficient algorithm. In this problem, we can use a two-pointer approach to check if a string is a palindrome. This algorithm is O(n) time, where n is the length of the string. A more inefficient algorithm would be to reverse the string and compare it to the original string. This algorithm is O(n^2) time, which is much slower.

Title:
CODEFORCES 843_D. Dynamic Shortest Path

Pain points:
### Possible problems and bugs

1. **Incorrect implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm.** The most common mistake is to forget to initialize the distance array to `INT_MAX`. This will cause the algorithm to incorrectly find the shortest path.
2. **Incorrect handling of negative weights.** Dijkstra's algorithm does not work correctly if the graph contains negative-weight edges. If you encounter a negative-weight edge, you should either remove it from the graph or use a different algorithm to find the shortest path.
3. **Incorrect handling of parallel edges.** Parallel edges are edges that have the same source and destination vertices. Dijkstra's algorithm does not work correctly if the graph contains parallel edges. If you encounter parallel edges, you should either remove them from the graph or use a different algorithm to find the shortest path.
4. **Incorrect handling of self-loops.** Self-loops are edges that have the same source and destination vertices. Dijkstra's algorithm does not work correctly if the graph contains self-loops. If you encounter self-loops, you should either remove them from the graph or use a different algorithm to find the shortest path.
5. **Incorrect handling of disconnected graphs.** A disconnected graph is a graph that cannot be divided into two or more connected components by removing a single edge. Dijkstra's algorithm does not work correctly on disconnected graphs. If you encounter a disconnected graph, you should either add edges to connect the components or use a different algorithm to find the shortest path.

### How to avoid these problems

1. To avoid incorrect implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, make sure to initialize the distance array to `INT_MAX`.
2. To avoid incorrect handling of negative weights, either remove negative-weight edges from the graph or use a different algorithm to find the shortest path.
3. To avoid incorrect handling of parallel edges, either remove parallel edges from the graph or use a different algorithm to find the shortest path.
4. To avoid incorrect handling of self-loops, either remove self-loops from the graph or use a different algorithm to find the shortest path.
5. To avoid incorrect handling of disconnected graphs, either add edges to connect the components or use a different algorithm to find the shortest path.

CODEFORCES 864_B. Polycarp and Letters

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly identifying the lowercase letters.** The code may incorrectly identify the lowercase letters in the string, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the code may incorrectly identify the letter "A" as lowercase, when it is actually uppercase.
2. **Incorrectly identifying the uppercase letters.** The code may incorrectly identify the uppercase letters in the string, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the code may incorrectly identify the letter "a" as uppercase, when it is actually lowercase.
3. **Incorrectly identifying the pretty sets.** The code may incorrectly identify the pretty sets in the string, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the code may incorrectly identify a set of positions that contains both lowercase and uppercase letters as a pretty set, when it is not.
4. **Incorrectly counting the number of elements in the pretty sets.** The code may incorrectly count the number of elements in the pretty sets, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the code may incorrectly count a set of positions that contains two elements as a set of positions that contains three elements.
5. **Incorrectly printing the output.** The code may incorrectly print the output, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the code may print the number of elements in the pretty sets instead of the maximum number of elements in the pretty sets.

Title:
CODEFORCES 912_D. Fishes

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correctly parsed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is "3 3 2 3a", the program will try to parse the last element as an integer, which will fail.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the expected value**. The expected value is calculated by summing the probability of each possible outcome and multiplying it by the corresponding number of fishes caught. For example, if there are 3 fishes in a pond of size 3x3 and the scoop is of size 2x2, then the expected value is 3 * (1 / 9) = 1 / 3.
3. **Incorrect placement of the fishes**. The fishes must be placed in such a way that the expected value is maximized. For example, if the fishes are all placed in the same row, then the expected value will be lower than if they were placed in different rows.
4. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**. The program must be able to handle edge cases, such as when the number of fishes is equal to the number of cells in the pond or when the scoop is larger than the pond.
5. **Incorrect output format**. The output must be in the correct format, such as "3.1415926535".

By following these tips, you can avoid common problems and bugs when solving the Fishes problem.

CODEFORCES 988_C. Equal Sums

Pain points:
**1. Not considering the case where all sequences are equal**

In the first example, all sequences are equal to [2, 3, 1, 3, 2]. So, if we remove the second element from any sequence, the sum of the remaining elements will be equal to 8. So, we can print "YES" and any two pairs of indices (1, 2) and (2, 1). However, this is not the correct answer, because we need to choose two distinct sequences.

**2. Not considering the case where all sequences are of the same length**

In the second example, all sequences are of the same length (3). So, if we remove the first element from any sequence, the sum of the remaining elements will be equal to 4. So, we can print "YES" and any two pairs of indices (1, 1) and (2, 2). However, this is not the correct answer, because we need to remove exactly one element from each sequence.

**3. Not considering the case where the sum of all sequences is 0**

In the third example, the sum of all sequences is 0. So, if we remove any element from any sequence, the sum of the remaining elements will be 0. So, we can print "YES" and any two pairs of indices (1, 1) and (2, 2). However, this is not the correct answer, because we need to choose two distinct sequences.

**4. Not considering the case where the sum of all sequences is negative**

In the fourth example, the sum of all sequences is -10. So, if we remove any element from any sequence, the sum of the remaining elements will be negative. So, we cannot print "YES".

HACKEREARTH altf4-ctrlf4-and-the-game

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly initializing the matrix.** The matrix should be initialized to all zeros, but a developer might accidentally initialize it to all ones or all negative numbers. This would result in incorrect scores being calculated.
2. **Not handling the case where a player calls a number that has already been called.** If a player calls a number that has already been called, they should forfeit their turn. A developer might accidentally allow the player to continue playing, which would result in incorrect scores being calculated.
3. **Not correctly calculating the scores.** The scores should be calculated by adding up the values of all the cells that a player owns. A developer might accidentally calculate the scores incorrectly, which would result in incorrect output.
4. **Not handling the case where a player calls a number that is not in the range [1, N].** If a player calls a number that is not in the range [1, N], they should forfeit their turn.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect division:** The developer may incorrectly divide the number of candles by the number of candles needed to make a new candle. This would result in an incorrect answer.
2. **Off-by-one error:** The developer may forget to add one to the number of new candles created. This would result in an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect typecasting:** The developer may incorrectly typecast the number of candles or the number of candles needed to make a new candle. This would result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Index out of bounds:** The developer may try to access an index that is outside of the bounds of the array of candles. This would result in a runtime error.
5. **Memory leak:** The developer may not release the memory allocated for the array of candles. This would result in a memory leak.

Title:
HACKEREARTH defective-trophy-1

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for N**. The input for this problem is a number, so we need to make sure that we are using the correct data type to store it. If we use an integer data type, then we could run into problems if N is larger than the maximum value that an integer can store. We can avoid this problem by using a long data type, which can store numbers that are larger than the maximum value that an integer can store.

**2. Not using the weighing balance optimally**. The goal of this problem is to find the minimum number of tries required to find the defective trophy. We can do this by using the weighing balance optimally. One way to do this is to divide the trophies into two groups of equal size and then weigh each group. If the two groups weigh the same, then the defective trophy is in one of the groups. We can then repeat this process until we find the defective trophy.

**3. Not handling the edge cases correctly**. There are a few edge cases that we need to handle correctly in this problem. For example, what if N is equal to 1? In this case, there is no need to use the weighing balance at all, because we can just weigh the trophy and determine if it is defective. We also need to handle the case where all of the trophies have the same weight. In this case, we cannot use the weighing balance to find the defective trophy.

**4. Not using a test suite**. It is always a good idea to use a test suite when you are writing code. This will help you to catch bugs early on and prevent them from causing problems in production. A test suite for this problem could include tests for the following:

    * Correctly handling the input data
    * Using the weighing balance optimally
    * Handling the edge cases correctly

**5. Not commenting your code**. It is important to comment your code so that other developers can understand what it does. This will help to prevent bugs and make it easier to maintain the code in the future.

2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong type. For example, the numbers may be entered as strings instead of integers. The developer should check the data type of the input and convert it to the correct type if necessary.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer may accidentally miscount the number of students or candies. This can lead to incorrect results. The developer should carefully check their code to make sure that all of the calculations are correct.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may make a mistake in their logic. For example, they may incorrectly check whether two numbers are equal or not. The developer should carefully check their logic to make sure that it is correct.
5. **Memory leaks**. The developer may accidentally create memory leaks in their code. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing. The developer should use the `delete` keyword to free up memory when it is no longer needed.
6. **Synchronization issues**. The developer may accidentally create synchronization issues in their code. This can lead to the program behaving incorrectly or crashing. The developer should use locks to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.
7. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer may accidentally create security vulnerabilities in their code. This can allow attackers to access sensitive data or take control of the program. The developer should carefully review their code to make sure that it is secure.

Title:
HACKEREARTH utkarsh-and-jumps

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect calculation of the probability of reaching N.** The probability of reaching N is not simply the product of the probabilities of taking two steps and three steps, as the two events are not independent. For example, if Utkarsh takes two steps, he cannot then take three steps.
2. **Incorrect use of floating-point numbers.** The output must contain exactly 6 digits after the decimal point, but some programming languages may not have the precision to represent numbers with this many digits. This can lead to rounding errors, which can affect the accuracy of the final answer.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement specifies that N must be greater than 0 and P must be less than or equal to 100. However, some programming languages may not check these constraints, which can lead to errors if the input values do not satisfy the requirements.
4. **Incorrect use of the random number generator.** The problem statement specifies that Utkarsh will jump 2 steps with probability P/100 and jump 3 steps with probability 1-P/100. However, some programming languages may not generate random numbers with this exact distribution. This can lead to errors in the final answer.
5. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for calculating the probability of reaching N is relatively simple, but there are a few ways that it can be implemented incorrectly. For example, the algorithm should take into account the fact that Utkarsh cannot jump more than N steps.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the constraints. It is also important to test your code thoroughly to ensure that it produces the correct results.

Title:
ATCODER p02595 AtCoder Beginner Contest 174 - Distance

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is given as integers, but the distance between two points is a floating-point number. If we use integers to calculate the distance, the result will be inaccurate.

**2. Using the wrong formula**

The distance between two points is given by the following formula:

```
d = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
```

Some developers may accidentally use the following formula:

```
d = (x^2 + y^2)
```

This will result in an incorrect answer.

**3. Not handling the edge cases**

The input data may contain some edge cases, such as points with a negative x-coordinate or a negative y-coordinate. Developers need to make sure that their code can handle these edge cases correctly.

**4. Using an inefficient algorithm**

The naive algorithm for finding the number of points within a given distance from the origin is to iterate over all the points and check if each point is within the distance. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(N^2), where N is the number of points.

There are more efficient algorithms for this problem, such as the divide-and-conquer algorithm and the binary search algorithm. These algorithms have a time complexity of O(N log N).

**5. Not using a programming language that is well-suited for the problem**

Some programming languages are better suited for certain types of problems than others. For example, Python is a good choice for problems that require a lot of string manipulation, while C++ is a good choice for problems that require a lot of mathematical calculations.

Developers should choose a programming language that is well-suited for the problem they are trying to solve.

Pain points:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
 ```
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of red and blue balls.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving this problem. They will often forget to account for the fact that there are an odd number of balls, and as a result, they will incorrectly count the number of red and blue balls.
2. **Asking too many questions.** The problem states that you can only ask at most 210 questions. If you ask more than this, you will not be able to solve the problem.
3. **Not using the information from previous questions.** The problem states that you can ask any N of the 2N balls. This means that you can use the information from previous questions to help you decide which balls to ask about in the future.
4. **Not being careful with your logic.** The problem requires you to make a series of logical deductions in order to solve it. If you are not careful with your logic, you may make a mistake and not be able to solve the problem.
5. **Not using the constraints to your advantage.** The problem states that N is an odd number. This can be used to your advantage when solving the problem. For example, you can use the fact that N is an odd number to help you determine which balls to ask about in the future.

Title:
ATCODER p02993 AtCoder Beginner Contest 131 - Security

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect input format

The input format specifies that `S` is a 4-character string consisting of digits. However, a developer may accidentally input a string that is not 4 characters long or that contains non-digit characters. This could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

### 2. Incorrect comparison of strings

The program must compare the strings `S` and `S[1:]` to determine if they contain two consecutive digits that are the same. However, a developer may accidentally compare the strings using the `==` operator, which will return `True` if the strings are equal, even if they do not contain two consecutive digits that are the same. This could cause the program to incorrectly output `Good` for a security code that is actually hard to enter.

### 3. Incorrect output

The program must output `Bad` if `S` is hard to enter and `Good` otherwise. However, a developer may accidentally output the wrong value. This could cause the program to give incorrect feedback to the user.

### 4. Other bugs

There are a number of other possible bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. For example, the program may not handle invalid input correctly, it may not be able to handle large security codes, or it may not be able to run efficiently. It is important to carefully test the program to ensure that it is free of bugs before releasing it to users.

Title:
ATCODER p03134 Yahoo Programming Contest 2019 - Pass

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem states that "Takahashi has a sequence that is initially empty". This means that Takahashi starts with no balls. However, some solutions incorrectly assume that Takahashi starts with one ball.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm for solving this problem is quite simple. However, it is easy to make mistakes when implementing the algorithm. For example, some solutions incorrectly count the number of balls in Takahashi's sequence after each iteration of the algorithm.
3. **Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic.** The problem states that the answer should be modulo 998244353. However, some solutions incorrectly use modulo arithmetic when computing the answer. For example, some solutions incorrectly divide the answer by 998244353.
4. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** The problem states that the length of the input string can be up to 2000. However, some solutions incorrectly assume that the length of the input string is always less than 2000. This can lead to overflow errors when computing the answer.
5. **Incorrect use of the `modpow()` function.** The `modpow()` function is a built-in Python function that can be used to compute the modular exponentiation of a number. However, some solutions incorrectly use the `modpow()` function when computing the answer. For example, some solutions incorrectly use the `modpow()` function to compute the number of balls in Takahashi's sequence after each iteration of the algorithm.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement. It is also important to carefully implement the algorithm and to use modulo arithmetic correctly. Finally, it is important to handle overflow errors and to use the `modpow()` function correctly.

Title:
ATCODER p03279 AtCoder Regular Contest 101 - Robots and Exits

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input data contains a lot of integers. If we use an incorrect data type to store these integers, it may cause overflow. For example, if we use `int` to store the coordinates of robots and exits, the maximum value of `int` is `2147483647`, which is not enough to store the coordinates of robots and exits.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The problem asks us to find the number of combinations of exits that can be used by the robots when all the robots disappear. We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. However, if we use an incorrect algorithm, it may not give the correct answer. For example, the following algorithm is incorrect:

```
def count_combinations(robots, exits):
  """
  Returns the number of combinations of exits that can be used by the robots.

  Args:
    robots: A list of integers representing the coordinates of the robots.
    exits: A list of integers representing the coordinates of the exits.

  Returns:
    An integer representing the number of combinations of exits that can be used
    by the robots.
  """

  # Initialize the DP table.

  dp = [[0] * (len(exits) + 1) for _ in range(len(robots) + 1)]

  # Iterate over the robots and the exits.

  for i in range(len(robots) + 1):
    for j in range(len(exits) + 1):
      # If there are no robots or no exits, the number of combinations is 0.

      if i == 0 or j == 0:
        dp[i][j] = 0
      # If there is only one robot or one exit, the number of combinations is 1.

      elif i == 1 or j == 1:
        dp[i][j] = 1
      # Otherwise, the number of combinations is the sum of the number of
      # combinations when the robot is at the previous position and the number
      # of combinations when the exit is at the previous position.

      else:
        dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]) % 10**9 + 7

  return dp[len(robots)][len(exits)]
```

This algorithm is incorrect because it does not take into account the order in which the robots and exits are used. For example, if the robots are at the coordinates `[1, 2, 3]` and the exits are at the coordinates `[4, 5, 6]`, then the number of combinations of exits that can be used by the robots is 3, not 6.

**3. Using incorrect modular arithmetic**

The problem asks us to find the number of combinations of exits that can be used by the robots when all the robots disappear, modulo 10^9 + 7. This means that we need to use modular arithmetic to calculate the answer. If we do not use modular arithmetic correctly, it may cause the answer to be incorrect.

For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
def count_combinations(robots, exits):
  """
  Returns the number of combinations of exits that can be used by the robots.

  Args:
    robots: A list of integers representing the coordinates of the robots.
    exits: A list of integers representing the coordinates of the exits.

  Returns:
    An integer representing the number of combinations of exits that can be used
    by the robots.
  """

  # Initialize the DP table.

  dp = [[0] * (len(exits) + 1) for _ in range(len(robots) + 1)]

  # Iterate over the robots and the exits.

  for i in range(len(robots) + 1):
    for j in range(len(exits) + 1):
      # If there are no robots or no exits, the number of combinations is 0.

      if i == 0 or j == 0:
        dp[i][j] = 0
      # If there is only one robot or one exit, the number of combinations is 1.

      elif i == 1 or j == 1:
        dp[i][j] = 1

ATCODER p03434 AtCoder Beginner Contest 088 - Card Game for Two

Pain points:
**1. Off-by-one errors**

When iterating through the list of cards, it is easy to make an off-by-one error and miss a card or count a card twice. This can lead to incorrect results.

**2. Incorrect handling of ties**

In the game of card for two, if Alice and Bob both want to take the same card, the rules state that Alice gets to take the card. However, it is possible for a developer to accidentally implement the rules incorrectly and allow Bob to take the card instead. This can lead to incorrect results.

**3. Incorrect handling of negative numbers**

The problem statement does not specify whether the numbers on the cards can be negative. If a developer does not handle negative numbers correctly, this can lead to incorrect results.

**4. Incorrect handling of duplicate numbers**

The problem statement does not specify whether the numbers on the cards can be duplicated. If a developer does not handle duplicate numbers correctly, this can lead to incorrect results.

**5. Incorrect handling of the end of the list**

When iterating through the list of cards, it is important to check for the end of the list and handle it correctly. If a developer does not handle the end of the list correctly, this can lead to incorrect results.

Title:
ATCODER p03750 AtCoder Grand Contest 013 - Two Faced Cards

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake when reading in the data. For example, if you forget to include a newline character between two lines of input, the program will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data is given as a series of integers, so it is important to make sure that you are reading the data into the correct data type. For example, if you try to read a string into an integer variable, the program will likely crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. The problem statement specifies that there are N cards in the first deck, and N+1 cards in the second deck. It is easy to make a mistake when counting the number of cards in each deck, which could lead to incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The problem statement is quite long and complex, so it is easy to make a mistake when implementing the solution. For example, you might forget to check whether a card from the second deck is larger than a card from the first deck, which could lead to incorrect results.
5. **Memory leaks**. The program should not allocate any memory that it does not need, and it should free any memory that it does allocate when it is no longer needed. Memory leaks can cause the program to run out of memory and crash.

**Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:**

1. **Be careful when reading in the input data**. Make sure that you are reading the data in the correct format, and that you are using the correct data types.
2. **Test your code thoroughly**. Write unit tests to verify that your code is working correctly. You should also test your code on a variety of input data to make sure that it can handle all possible cases.
3. **Use a debugger**. A debugger can help you to track down errors in your code. You can use a debugger to set breakpoints, step through your code line by line, and inspect the values of variables.
4. **Ask for help**. If you are stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help from a friend, family member, or online forum. There are also many resources available online that can help you learn how to program.

Title:
ATCODER p03914 CODE FESTIVAL 2016 Final - Road of the King

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect calculation of the number of paths**

The number of paths from town 1 to town N is N!. However, the number of paths from town 1 to town N that pass through town i is (N - 1)!. So, the number of paths from town 1 to town N that do not pass through town i is N! - (N - 1)!.

**2. Using the wrong modulo operator**

The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. So, if you divide 100 by 7, you get 2. However, if you modulo 100 by 7, you get 3. This is because 100 / 7 = 14 with a remainder of 2.

**3. Using the wrong data type**

When working with large numbers, it is important to use the correct data type. For example, if you are working with numbers that are larger than 2^31 - 1, you should use the long long data type.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

When writing code, it is important to handle edge cases. For example, if the input is invalid, you should print an error message and exit the program.

**5. Not using a test suite**

When writing code, it is important to use a test suite to ensure that your code is working correctly. A test suite is a set of tests that verify that your code is doing what it is supposed to do.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain a space between the number and the unit, or the number may be negative.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed. For example, the student number may not be in the correct format, or it may be followed by other characters.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The student number of the student who keeps the "class flag" may be incorrect. This could be due to a mistake in the algorithm, or a mistake in the implementation of the algorithm.
4. **Memory leak**. The program may not release memory that it is no longer using. This could lead to a memory leak, which could eventually crash the program.
5. **Security vulnerability**. The program may be vulnerable to a security attack, such as a buffer overflow or a denial-of-service attack.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully follow the input and output formats, and to correctly implement the algorithm. It is also important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and does not have any security vulnerabilities.

AIZU p00469 Lining up the cards

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input format is not correctly parsed, resulting in incorrect variable types. For example, the input `4
2
1
2
12
1
6
3
72
2
12
7
2
1
0
0` should be parsed as `n = 4`, `k = 2`, `a = [1, 2, 12, 7]`, but it is parsed as `n = '4'`, `k = '2'`, `a = [1, 2, '12', 7]`. This will cause errors when calculating the number of integers that can be created.
2. **Incorrect calculation**. The number of integers that can be created is calculated incorrectly. For example, the input `4
2
1
2
12
1
6
3
72
2
12
7
2
1
0
0` should be calculated as `7`, but it is calculated as `68`. This is because the calculation does not take into account the fact that the same integer can be created from a combination of different cards.
3. **Incorrect output**. The output is not formatted correctly. For example, the output `7` should be formatted as `7`.

Title:
AIZU p00661 Time Manipulation

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect variable type**

The input format specifies that `n` and `m` should be integers, but the code below assigns them as floats. This will cause errors when calculating the expected value.

```
n, m = map(float, input().split())
```

**2. Incorrect loop condition**

The code below uses a for loop to iterate over the list of prohibited years, but the condition `i < m` is incorrect. This will cause the loop to iterate one too many times, resulting in an incorrect answer.

```
for i in range(m):
    if p[i] % n == 0:
        print(0)
        break
```

**3. Incorrect calculation of expected value**

The code below calculates the expected value by summing the probability of each possible year and multiplying it by the corresponding price. However, the probability of each year is not calculated correctly.

```
expected_value = 0
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if i not in p:
        expected_value += (1 / n) * i
```

The correct way to calculate the probability of each year is to use the following formula:

```
probability = 1 / (n - sum(p))
```

**4. Incorrect output format**

The code below outputs the expected value with an incorrect precision. The correct precision is 1e-5.

```
print(expected_value)
```

**5. Missing error handling**

The code below does not handle the case where `n` or `m` is equal to 0. This will cause a runtime error.

```
n, m = map(float, input().split())
if n == 0 or m == 0:
    print(0)
```

**6. Unnecessary code**

The code below includes the following unnecessary code:

```
if p[i] % n == 0:
    print(0)
    break
```

This code is unnecessary because the loop will already break if `i` is equal to `m`.

**7. Inefficient code**

The code below is inefficient because it iterates over the list of prohibited years multiple times. This can be improved by caching the list of prohibited years in a set.

```
for i in range(m):
    if p[i] % n == 0:
        print(0)
        break
```

----------
Here are possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect data format.** The input data may not be in the correct format. For example, the number of orders may be negative or greater than 1000. The name of a dealer may be too long or contain non-alphabetical characters. The type of an order may be incorrect. The quoted price may be negative or greater than 1000.
* **Deals that violate the rules.** The market does not allow deals between a pair of sell and buy orders from the same dealer. The system may make a deal that violates this rule.
* **Deals that are not made.** The market closes at 22:00. Any orders that are received after 22:00 are cancelled. The system may make a deal with an order that was received after 22:00.
* **Deals that are not reported.** The system must report all the deals that are made. The system may not report some of the deals.
* **Incorrect output format.** The output format may be incorrect. For example, the names of the commodities or dealers may not be in the correct order. The prices may not be rounded to the nearest integer.

Title:
AIZU p00935 Decimal Sequences

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible that the developer will misinterpret the input and make a mistake. For example, the input could be in the form of a list of numbers, a string of numbers, or a file containing the numbers. The developer must make sure to correctly parse the input and convert it into the correct format.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the next term**. The next term in the sequence is calculated by adding the previous two terms. The developer must make sure to correctly calculate this value. For example, if the previous two terms are 1 and 2, the next term should be 3, not 4.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When calculating the next term in the sequence, it is possible to make an off-by-one error. For example, if the previous two terms are 1 and 2, the next term should be 3, not 4. The developer must be careful to avoid these types of errors.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly defined, so it is possible that the developer will misinterpret the output and make a mistake. For example, the output could be a list of numbers, a string of numbers, or a file containing the numbers. The developer must make sure to correctly format the output.

Possible bugs and problems:

* The input format is not correct. For example, the input `9 13 1 2 1 3 2 9 3 4 3 5 3 6 4 9 5 7 6 7 6 8 7 9 8 9 9 1` is not correct because there is a space between `9` and `1`.
* The output format is not correct. For example, the output `5` is not correct because it should be `5\n`.
* The algorithm is incorrect. For example, the algorithm below does not correctly compute the minimum number of edges to reconstruct the tree:

```
def find_min_edges(n, m, edges):
  # Find all the nodes that have only one edge.
  nodes_with_one_edge = []
  for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if len(edges[i]) == 1:
      nodes_with_one_edge.append(i)

  # Find the minimum number of edges to reconstruct the tree.
  min_edges = len(nodes_with_one_edge)
  for i in range(len(nodes_with_one_edge) - 1):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(nodes_with_one_edge)):
      min_edges = min(min_edges, len(edges[nodes_with_one_edge[i]]) + len(edges[nodes_with_one_edge[j]]) - 2)

  return min_edges

n, m = map(int, input().split())
edges = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    edges[a].append(b)
    edges[b].append(a)

print(find_min_edges(n, m, edges))
```

This algorithm is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that some edges may be directed. For example, the following graph has three edges, but it cannot be reconstructed with only two edges:

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
```

The algorithm above would return 2, which is incorrect.

* **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is possible that the developer will misinterpret the input and make a mistake. For example, the input could be in the form of a list of lists, or it could be in the form of a single string. The developer must be careful to parse the input correctly and ensure that it is in the correct format.
* **Incorrect calculation of the vector field**. The vector field is calculated by taking the derivative of the function with respect to each of the input variables. The developer must be careful to use the correct formula for the derivative, and they must also be careful to avoid rounding errors.
* **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly defined, so it is possible that the developer will misinterpret the output and make a mistake. For example, the output could be in the form of a list of lists, or it could be in the form of a single string. The developer must be careful to format the output correctly.
* **Memory leaks**. The developer must be careful to free up memory that is no longer needed. If they do not do this, the program will eventually run out of memory and crash.
* **Infinite loops**. The developer must be careful to avoid infinite loops. An infinite loop occurs when the program executes the same code over and over again without ever terminating. This can happen if the developer makes a mistake in their logic or if they use an incorrect algorithm.
* **Incorrect error handling**. The developer must be careful to handle errors correctly. If they do not do this, the program may crash or produce incorrect results. For example, the developer should check for invalid input and handle it gracefully.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the output contains a letter instead of a number, the program may crash.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program does not check all of the input values, it may miss some errors.
4. **Incorrect error handling**. The program may not handle errors correctly, which may lead to incorrect results or crashes. For example, if the program does not handle invalid input, it may crash.
5. **Incorrect testing**. The program may not be tested thoroughly, which may lead to incorrect results or bugs. For example, if the program is not tested with invalid input, it may not catch errors.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully follow the input and output format, use the correct logic, handle errors correctly, and test the program thoroughly.
