Title:
CODECHEF dbz16xs1

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data type**

The input and output constraints are very large. If we use an incorrect data type, such as `int`, we may get an incorrect answer. For example, if we use `int` to store the input `10^18`, the value will be truncated to `2147483647`. This will lead to an incorrect answer.

**2. Using incorrect algorithm**

The correct algorithm for this problem is to use binary search. However, if we use an incorrect algorithm, such as a linear search, we may get an incorrect answer. For example, if we use a linear search to find the minimum positive number `K` such that `F(K) = X`, we may iterate through all the positive numbers from 1 to `X`, which is very inefficient.

**3. Not handling edge cases correctly**

There are a few edge cases that we need to handle correctly in this problem. For example, if `X = 0`, then the answer is `-1`. If `X = 1`, then the answer is `1`. If `X > 2^31 - 1`, then the answer is `-1`. We need to make sure that we handle these edge cases correctly in our code.

**4. Not using efficient data structures**

We can use a binary search tree to store the values of `F(K)` for all positive numbers `K`. This will allow us to find the minimum positive number `K` such that `F(K) = X` very efficiently.

CODECHEF igame

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** The problem statement is not very clear, so it is important to read it carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked. For example, it is not clear whether Alice and Bob can move the vehicle in the same direction in their respective turns.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The solution should be implemented correctly in order to get the correct output. For example, the solution should take into account all of the possible moves that Alice and Bob can make.
3. **Incorrect testing of the solution.** The solution should be tested thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly. For example, the solution should be tested on a variety of input values to make sure that it handles all of the possible cases.
4. **Incorrect debugging of the solution.** If the solution does not work correctly, it is important to be able to debug the problem and find the source of the error. For example, the debugger can be used to step through the code and see where the error is occurring.
5. **Incorrect submission of the solution.** Once the solution is working correctly, it is important to submit it to the competition in the correct format. For example, the solution should be submitted in the form of a text file.

CODECHEF muldiv

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem is asking us to perform the operation F on N, which is defined as follows:

```
F:

for i from 1 to M inclusive, do
	if N is a multiple of K,
		divide N by K
	else,
		multiply N by K
print N
```

So, we need to iterate from 1 to M and, for each iteration, check if N is a multiple of K. If it is, we divide N by K; otherwise, we multiply N by K. Finally, we print N.

2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** The following is an incorrect implementation of the solution:

```
for i in range(1, M + 1):
    if N % K == 0:
        N = N // K
    else:
        N = N * K

print(N)
```

This implementation is incorrect because it does not check if N is a multiple of K before dividing or multiplying it by K. This can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Incorrect test cases.** The test cases provided in the problem statement are not exhaustive. For example, the test case `42 3 2` does not test the case where N is not a multiple of K. This can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Incorrect output.** The output of the solution should be the result of performing the operation F on N. For example, the output of the solution for the test case `42 3 2` should be `42`.

5. **Incorrect runtime.** The solution should run in time O(M), where M is the number of iterations. The following is an incorrect solution that runs in time O(N):

```
for i in range(1, M + 1):
    if N % K == 0:
        N = N // K
    else:
        N = N * K

print(N)
```

This solution runs in time O(N) because it iterates through all the elements of N.

Title:
CODECHEF rrcopy

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly computing the length of the original array.** The problem states that the original array can be obtained by a finite number of copy-paste operations. This means that the length of the original array must be less than or equal to the length of the resulting array. However, some developers may incorrectly compute the length of the original array by simply subtracting the number of copy-paste operations from the length of the resulting array. This can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Not considering all possible cases.** The problem states that the original array can be obtained by a finite number of copy-paste operations. However, some developers may only consider a limited number of cases when computing the length of the original array. This can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Using incorrect data structures.** The problem states that the original array can be obtained by a finite number of copy-paste operations. This means that the original array must be a contiguous subsequence of the resulting array. However, some developers may use data structures that do not support contiguous subsequences. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Implementing the algorithm incorrectly.** The algorithm for computing the length of the original array is relatively simple. However, some developers may incorrectly implement the algorithm, which can lead to incorrect results.
5. **Not handling errors correctly.** The problem may contain errors, such as invalid input data. Some developers may not handle these errors correctly, which can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.

CODEFORCES 101_D. Castle

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm for finding the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted directed graph. It is often used to solve the all-pairs shortest path problem.

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm works by iteratively computing the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices, starting with the shortest paths from each vertex to itself (which are all 0). In each iteration, the algorithm considers all pairs of vertices (u, v) and updates the shortest path from u to v if the shortest path from u to v through an intermediate vertex w is shorter than the current shortest path.

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a very efficient algorithm, and it runs in O(V^3) time, where V is the number of vertices in the graph. However, it is important to implement the algorithm correctly, as there are a number of common errors that can be made.

One common error is to forget to initialize the distance matrix to infinity. This can lead to incorrect results, as the algorithm will not be able to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.

Another common error is to forget to update the distance matrix in the inner loop. This can also lead to incorrect results, as the algorithm will not be able to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.

Finally, it is important to make sure that the graph is represented in an adjacency matrix format. This is because the Floyd-Warshall algorithm only works on graphs that are represented in this format.

### 2. Incorrect implementation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm

The Bellman-Ford algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted directed graph. It is a dynamic programming algorithm, and it works by iteratively improving on a tentative shortest path tree.

The Bellman-Ford algorithm works by starting with a tentative shortest path tree that consists of the single source vertex. In each iteration, the algorithm considers all edges in the graph and updates the tentative shortest path tree if a shorter path is found. The algorithm terminates when no more improvements can be made to the tentative shortest path tree.

The Bellman-Ford algorithm is a very efficient algorithm, and it runs in O(VE) time, where V is the number of vertices in the graph and E is the number of edges in the graph. However, it is important to implement the algorithm correctly, as there are a number of common errors that can be made.

One common error is to forget to initialize the distance array to infinity. This can lead to incorrect results, as the algorithm will not be able to find the shortest paths to all vertices.

Another common error is to forget to update the distance array in the inner loop. This can also lead to incorrect results, as the algorithm will not be able to find the shortest paths to all vertices.

Finally, it is important to make sure that the graph is represented in an adjacency list format. This is because the Bellman-Ford algorithm only works on graphs that are represented in this format.

### 3. Incorrect implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm

The Dijkstra algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted directed graph. It is a greedy algorithm, and it works by iteratively finding the vertex with the smallest distance from the source vertex and adding it to a priority queue.

The Dijkstra algorithm works by starting with a tentative shortest path tree that consists of the single source vertex. In each iteration, the algorithm removes the vertex with the smallest distance from the source vertex from the priority queue and adds all of its adjacent vertices to the priority queue. The algorithm terminates when all vertices have been added to the priority queue.

The Dijkstra algorithm is a very efficient algorithm, and it runs in O(E log V) time, where V is the number of vertices in the graph and E is the number of edges in the graph. However, it is important to implement the algorithm correctly, as there are a number of common errors that can be made.

One common error is to forget to initialize the distance array to infinity. This can lead to incorrect results, as the algorithm will not be able to find the shortest paths to all vertices.

Another common error is to forget to update the distance array in the inner loop. This can also lead to incorrect results, as the algorithm will not be able to find the shortest paths to all vertices.

Finally, it is important to make sure that the graph is represented in an adjacency list format. This is because the Dijkstra algorithm only works on graphs that are represented in this format.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain more than three numbers, or the numbers may not be in the correct range.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should contain the first m characters of the k-th element of A(F(n)), or the whole element if its length is less than m. For example, the output may contain more than m characters, or it may not be a valid string.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the k-th element of A(F(n))**. The k-th element of A(F(n)) is not calculated correctly. For example, the element may be out of the range of the Fibonacci string, or it may not be lexicographically sorted.
4. **Incorrect calculation of the first m characters of the k-th element of A(F(n))**. The first m characters of the k-th element of A(F(n)) are not calculated correctly. For example, the characters may not be in the correct order, or they may not be a valid string.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1088_E. Ehab and a component choosing problem

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the DFS algorithm**

The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that is used to traverse a graph. It works by starting at a given vertex and exploring all of its adjacent vertices. This process is repeated for each of the adjacent vertices until all vertices in the graph have been visited.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing the DFS algorithm is to forget to mark the vertices as visited as they are being explored. This can lead to the algorithm getting stuck in an infinite loop.

To avoid this problem, it is important to mark each vertex as visited as it is being explored. This can be done by setting a boolean flag to true.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the union-find algorithm**

The union-find algorithm is a data structure that is used to track the connected components of a graph. It works by assigning each vertex in the graph a unique ID. When two vertices are connected by an edge, their IDs are merged together.

One common mistake that developers make when implementing the union-find algorithm is to forget to check if two vertices are already connected before merging their IDs. This can lead to the algorithm incorrectly merging two vertices that are not actually connected.

To avoid this problem, it is important to check if two vertices are already connected before merging their IDs. This can be done by using a hash table to store the IDs of all vertices in the graph.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the maximum weight**

The maximum weight is the sum of the weights of all vertices in the graph that are in the same connected component. When calculating the maximum weight, it is important to make sure that you are only considering vertices that are in the same connected component.

One common mistake that developers make when calculating the maximum weight is to include vertices that are not in the same connected component. This can lead to the algorithm incorrectly calculating the maximum weight.

To avoid this problem, it is important to make sure that you are only considering vertices that are in the same connected component. This can be done by using the union-find algorithm to track the connected components of the graph.

**4. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is two space-separated integers. The first integer represents the maximum weight of the connected components, and the second integer represents the number of connected components.

One common mistake that developers make when outputting the solution is to forget to include the space between the two integers. This can lead to the solution being incorrect.

To avoid this problem, it is important to make sure that you include the space between the two integers. This can be done by using the `print()` function in Python or the `cout` object in C++.

CODEFORCES 1136_E. Nastya Hasn't Written a Legend

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** This is the most common mistake that developers make when solving any problem. It is important to read the problem statement carefully and make sure that you understand all of the details. In this problem, it is important to understand that the queries are processed in the order they are given, and that the changes to the array are made before the next query is processed.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the solution.** Once you have a good understanding of the problem statement, you need to come up with an efficient solution. There are a few different ways to solve this problem, but one simple approach is to use a segment tree. A segment tree is a data structure that can be used to efficiently answer range queries on a sorted array. In this case, we can use a segment tree to store the cumulative sum of the array a. This will allow us to quickly answer queries of the form "what is the sum of the elements from index i to index j?".
3. **Incorrect testing of the solution.** Once you have implemented your solution, it is important to test it thoroughly. This can be done by creating a set of test cases that cover all of the different possible scenarios. In this case, you should test your solution with both valid and invalid queries. You should also test your solution with different input sizes.
4. **Incorrect submission of the solution.** Once you are confident that your solution is correct, you need to submit it to the competition. It is important to make sure that you follow the submission instructions carefully. In this case, you need to make sure that your solution is written in the correct language and that it meets all of the other requirements.

**Here are some specific bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **A bug in the implementation of the segment tree.** One common bug is to incorrectly implement the segment tree. For example, you might forget to initialize the segment tree correctly, or you might make a mistake in the way that you update the segment tree when a query is processed.
* **A bug in the implementation of the query processing code.** Another common bug is to incorrectly implement the code that processes the queries. For example, you might forget to update the segment tree when a query is processed, or you might make a mistake in the way that you calculate the answer to a query.
* **A bug in the testing code.** One common bug is to incorrectly implement the testing code. For example, you might forget to test your solution with invalid queries, or you might not test your solution with different input sizes.
* **A bug in the submission process.** One common bug is to incorrectly submit your solution to the competition. For example, you might forget to include the correct file name, or you might not follow the submission instructions correctly.

4. **Incorrect calculation.** The developer may incorrectly calculate the sum of the minimum heights in the submatrices.
5. **Memory errors.** The developer may not allocate enough memory to store the matrix or the submatrices.
6. **Time complexity.** The developer's solution may have a time complexity that is too high.
7. **Incorrect output format.** The developer's output may not be in the correct format. For example, the output may not have the correct number of digits.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1213_A. Chips Moving

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input contains integers, so you should use the `int` data type to store them. Using a smaller data type, such as `short` or `byte`, will cause problems when you try to perform arithmetic operations on the values. For example, if you try to add two `short` values that are larger than `127`, the result will be truncated to `127`, which is incorrect.

**2. Not handling negative numbers correctly**

The input may contain negative numbers. If you don't handle negative numbers correctly, your code may produce incorrect results. For example, if you try to divide a negative number by 2, the result will be a negative number.

**3. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The problem can be solved using a simple greedy algorithm. The algorithm works by repeatedly moving the chip with the largest absolute value to the middle. This process will eventually converge to a solution where all of the chips have the same value.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement specifies a few edge cases that you need to handle. For example, the problem statement states that the number of chips must be at least 1 and at most 100. If you don't handle these edge cases correctly, your code may not compile or may produce incorrect results.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it. This will help you catch any bugs that you may have missed. You can test your code by using a variety of input values, including both valid and invalid values. You can also test your code by using a debugger to step through the code and watch how it behaves.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1236_B. Alice and the List of Presents

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**

The modulo operator (%) is used to find the remainder of a division. For example, 10 % 3 = 1. This means that 10 divided by 3 has a remainder of 1.

In the problem statement, the answer is required to be modulo 10^9+7. This means that the answer should be a number between 0 and 10^9+6. If you accidentally use the modulo operator (%) with a larger number, you will get an incorrect answer.

For example, if you calculate the answer to be 1000000000, and then modulo it by 10^9+7, you will get the answer 234567. This is incorrect, because the answer should be between 0 and 10^9+6.

**2. Using the wrong factorial function**

The factorial function (n!) is the product of all the numbers from 1 to n. For example, 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.

In the problem statement, the number of ways to pack the presents is given by the following formula:

```
(n+m-1)! / (n! * (m-1)!)
```

If you accidentally use the wrong factorial function, you will get an incorrect answer.

For example, if you calculate the factorial of 1000000000, you will get an overflow error. This is because the factorial of a number larger than 20 is too big to be represented by a computer.

**3. Using the wrong formula**

The formula for the number of ways to pack the presents is given by the following equation:

```
(n+m-1)! / (n! * (m-1)!)
```

This formula is correct, but it is important to make sure that you are using the correct factorial functions.

**4. Using the wrong data type**

The number of ways to pack the presents can be very large. For example, if n = 1000000000 and m = 1000000000, the number of ways to pack the presents is (1000000000 + 1000000000 - 1)! / (1000000000! * (1000000000 - 1)!). This number is too large to be represented by a 32-bit integer.

To avoid this problem, you should use a 64-bit integer data type.

**5. Using the wrong algorithm**

The naive algorithm for calculating the number of ways to pack the presents is to enumerate all possible ways to pack the presents and then count the number of ways that satisfy the given constraints. This algorithm is very inefficient, and it will not work for large values of n and m.

A more efficient algorithm is to use the following recurrence relation:

```
T(n, m) = T(n-1, m) + T(n, m-1)
```

where T(n, m) is the number of ways to pack n presents into m boxes. This recurrence relation can be solved using dynamic programming.

Title:
CODEFORCES 133_E. Logo Turtle

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly counting the number of turns.** The turtle can turn left or right, and each turn changes the direction of movement by 180 degrees. So, if the turtle starts facing east and makes one left turn, it will be facing west. If it makes another left turn, it will be facing east again.
2. **Not considering the starting position of the turtle.** The turtle can start facing any direction, so the distance it travels will depend on its starting position. For example, if the turtle starts facing east and makes one right turn, it will be facing south. If it makes another right turn, it will be facing west. So, the total distance it travels will be 2 units.
3. **Not considering the order of the commands.** The order of the commands matters, because it determines the direction of the turtle's movement. For example, if the turtle starts facing east and the commands are "F", "T", "F", the turtle will move 1 unit forward, turn left, and then move 1 unit forward again. So, the total distance it travels will be 2 units. However, if the commands are "T", "F", "F", the turtle will turn left, move 1 unit forward, and then move 1 unit forward again. So, the total distance it travels will be 3 units.
4. **Not considering the number of commands that can be changed.** The problem states that you have to change exactly n commands from the list. If you change more than n commands, the answer will be incorrect.
5. **Not considering the possibility of making no changes to the list.** The problem states that you have to change exactly n commands from the list. If n is 0, then you don't have to make any changes to the list. In this case, the answer will be the same as the distance the turtle would travel if you didn't make any changes to the list.

2. **Incorrect data type**. The data type of the input may not be correctly specified, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a string that is interpreted as an integer, the program may crash.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors occur when the program does not correctly account for the size of an array or other data structure. This can lead to errors such as accessing an element that is out of bounds or missing an element that should be included.
4. **Null pointer exceptions**. Null pointer exceptions occur when the program attempts to access a memory location that has not been initialized. This can occur when a pointer is not initialized or when a pointer is dereferenced after it has been freed.
5. **ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException**. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs when the program attempts to access an element of an array that is out of bounds. This can occur when the program tries to access an element that does not exist or when the program tries to access an element that has already been deleted.
6. **Arithmetic overflow**. Arithmetic overflow occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be represented by the data type of the variable. This can lead to errors such as incorrect results or incorrect behavior.
7. **Floating-point errors**. Floating-point errors occur when the results of a floating-point calculation are not accurate due to rounding errors. This can lead to errors such as incorrect results or incorrect behavior.
8. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when the program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
9. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to errors such as incorrect results or incorrect behavior.
10. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can lead to the program being stuck and unable to continue.

**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrectly calculating the number of stones in each pile.** This could lead to the developer incorrectly determining who will win the game.
2. **Incorrectly determining who has the first move.** This could lead to the developer incorrectly determining who will win the game.
3. **Incorrectly implementing the game logic.** This could lead to the developer incorrectly determining who will win the game.
4. **Incorrectly handling edge cases.** This could lead to the developer incorrectly determining who will win the game.
5. **Incorrectly testing the code.** This could lead to the developer incorrectly believing that the code is correct, when it is actually not.

**Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* A developer may incorrectly calculate the number of stones in each pile by adding the numbers of stones in each pile instead of subtracting them. This would lead to the developer incorrectly determining who will win the game.
* A developer may incorrectly determine who has the first move by assuming that the first player always has the first move. This would lead to the developer incorrectly determining who will win the game.
* A developer may incorrectly implement the game logic by allowing players to remove more stones from a pile than are actually in the pile. This would lead to the developer incorrectly determining who will win the game.
* A developer may incorrectly handle edge cases by not handling the case where all of the piles are empty. This would lead to the developer incorrectly determining who will win the game.
* A developer may incorrectly test the code by not testing all of the possible scenarios. This would lead to the developer incorrectly believing that the code is correct, when it is actually not.

Pain points:
The following are some possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect implementation of the game rules.** The game rules are not very complicated, but it is easy to make a mistake when implementing them. For example, a developer might forget that the opponent can also take half of the coins in the chest, or that the game ends when there are no more coins in the chest.
* **Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of coins that Mr. Chanek can get.** This is the most important part of the problem, and it is easy to make a mistake here. For example, a developer might forget that Mr. Chanek can always take one coin from the chest, or that the opponent will always take the move that gives them the most coins.
* **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The input data for this problem can contain some edge cases, such as negative numbers or numbers that are too large. A developer needs to make sure that their code can handle these edge cases correctly.
* **Incorrect testing.** It is important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it is correct. This means testing it with a variety of input data, including both valid and invalid data. It also means testing it with different strategies for Mr. Chanek and the opponent.

Title:
CODEFORCES 151_D. Quantity of Strings

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly defined, so it is easy to make a mistake and get an incorrect answer. For example, if you forget to add a space between the numbers, the program will not be able to parse the input correctly.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the number of strings**. The number of strings can be calculated in different ways, and it is important to choose the correct one. For example, you could count the number of strings by brute force, but this would be very time-consuming. A more efficient way would be to use a dynamic programming approach.
3. **Modulo arithmetic errors**. When working with modulo arithmetic, it is important to be careful about overflows and underflows. For example, if you add two numbers that are both greater than or equal to the modulus, the result will be less than the modulus.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. It is easy to make a mistake when counting the number of strings, especially if the strings are long. For example, you could forget to include the empty string in your count.
5. **Incorrect use of data structures**. The data structures you use to store the strings and their counts can have a significant impact on the performance of your program. For example, using a hash table to store the strings would be much faster than using a linked list.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. You should also carefully design your solution and test it thoroughly before submitting it.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1547_D. Co-growing Sequence

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the co-growing property.** The co-growing property states that for all `i` from 1 to `n - 1`, all ones (of binary representation) in `a_i` are in the places of ones (of binary representation) in `a_{i + 1}`. This means that if `a_i` has a one in the `j`th bit, then `a_{i + 1}` must also have a one in the `j`th bit. However, some solutions incorrectly implement this property by checking if `a_i & a_{i + 1} == a_i`. This is not sufficient, as it is possible for `a_i & a_{i + 1} == a_i` even if `a_i` and `a_{i + 1}` do not have the same ones in the same bits.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the lexicographic order.** The lexicographic order states that a sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is lexicographically smaller than a sequence `b_1, b_2, ..., b_n` if there exists `1 <= k <= n` such that `a_i = b_i` for any `1 <= i < k` but `a_k < b_k`. Some solutions incorrectly implement this property by comparing the sequences one element at a time. This is not sufficient, as it is possible for a sequence to be lexicographically smaller even if all of its elements are larger than the corresponding elements of the other sequence.
3. **Incorrect use of bit operations.** Bit operations are a powerful tool for solving problems involving binary numbers, but they can be tricky to use correctly. Some solutions incorrectly use bit operations, which can lead to errors in the output.
4. **Incorrect handling of overflow.** Overflow can occur when a calculation results in a number that is too large to be represented in the data type being used. Some solutions incorrectly handle overflow, which can lead to errors in the output.
5. **Incorrect use of dynamic programming.** Dynamic programming is a powerful technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems. Some solutions incorrectly use dynamic programming, which can lead to errors in the output.
6. **Incorrect use of memoization.** Memoization is a technique for caching the results of expensive calculations so that they do not need to be repeated. Some solutions incorrectly use memoization, which can lead to errors in the output.
7. **Incorrect use of recursion.** Recursion is a powerful technique for solving problems by calling themselves. Some solutions incorrectly use recursion, which can lead to errors in the output.
8. **Incorrect use of backtracking.** Backtracking is a technique for solving problems by exploring all possible solutions and backtracking when a solution is found to be invalid. Some solutions incorrectly use backtracking, which can lead to errors in the output.
9. **Incorrect use of brute force.** Brute force is a technique for solving problems by simply trying all possible solutions. Some solutions incorrectly use brute force, which can lead to errors in the output.
10. **Incorrect use of heuristics.** Heuristics are rules of thumb that can be used to improve the performance of an algorithm. Some solutions incorrectly use heuristics, which can lead to errors in the output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 290_E. HQ

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input string should be a single line of characters between 1 and 106 characters long. If the input string is not in the correct format, the program should output an error message.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be either "Yes" or "No". If the output is not in the correct format, the program should output an error message.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The program should check if the input string contains only the characters "H", "Q", and "+". If the string contains any other characters, the program should output "No". If the string contains only the characters "H", "Q", and "+" but does not form a valid HQ program, the program should also output "No".
4. **Memory leaks.** The program should not allocate any memory that it does not need. If the program allocates memory that it does not need, it may eventually run out of memory and crash.
5. **Race conditions.** The program should not be susceptible to race conditions. A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. If the program is susceptible to race conditions, it may produce incorrect results or crash.
6. **Deadlocks.** The program should not deadlock. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. If the program deadlocks, it will stop responding and the user will have to kill the process.
7. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program should not contain any security vulnerabilities. A security vulnerability is a weakness in the program that could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.
8. **Performance problems.** The program should be efficient and should not take too long to run. If the program is too slow, it will be unusable for practical purposes.

CODEFORCES 339_B. Xenia and Ringroad

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specified in the problem statement is very specific. Make sure to read it carefully and parse the input data correctly.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specified in the problem statement is also very specific. Make sure to format your output correctly.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When iterating over a list or array, it's easy to make a mistake and miss one element or count one element twice. Be careful to check your code carefully for off-by-one errors.
4. **Incorrect logic.** Make sure to understand the problem statement carefully and develop a correct solution. It's easy to make mistakes when you're under pressure, so take your time and double-check your work.
5. **Runtime errors.** Make sure your code runs within the time limit specified in the problem statement. This may require you to optimize your code or use a more efficient algorithm.
6. **Memory errors.** Make sure your code doesn't use more memory than is allowed. This may require you to use a more memory-efficient data structure or algorithm.
7. **Test case errors.** Make sure to test your code on a variety of test cases, including both small and large cases. This will help you to identify and fix any bugs in your code.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer might encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** A developer might incorrectly parse the input data, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the developer might assume that the input data is in the format `n m`, when it is actually in the format `n, m`.
* **Incorrect output format:** A developer might incorrectly format their output, resulting in a syntax error or a runtime error. For example, the developer might print the output as a string, when it should be printed as an integer.
* **Off-by-one errors:** A developer might accidentally miss one element or count one element twice when iterating over a list or array. This can lead to an incorrect answer. For example, the developer might forget to include the first element in the list when computing the sum of the elements.
* **Incorrect logic:** A developer might make a mistake in their logic, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, the developer might assume that the tasks are always assigned to consecutive houses, when this is not always the case.
* **Runtime errors:** A developer might use an inefficient algorithm or data structure, resulting in a runtime error. For example, the developer might use a linear search algorithm to find the index of an element in a list, when a binary search algorithm would be more efficient.
* **Memory errors:** A developer might use too much memory, resulting in a memory error. For example, the developer might create a large array that is never used.
* **Test case errors:** A developer might not test their code on a variety of test cases, resulting in a bug that only occurs on certain inputs. For example, the developer might not test their code on a large input, when the bug only occurs on large inputs.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a space instead of a comma, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the beauty score.** The beauty score is calculated by the formula ```c(a) = sum(abs(ai - aj))```, where ```ai``` and ```aj``` are two elements of the array. However, if the absolute value of the difference between two elements is greater than ```2*10^9```, the calculation will overflow and produce incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect handling of negative numbers.** The problem statement states that the elements of the array can be negative. However, if the absolute value of a negative number is greater than ```2*10^9```, the calculation will overflow and produce incorrect results.
4. **Incorrect handling of large arrays.** The problem statement states that the array can have up to ```2000``` elements. However, if the array is very large, the program may run out of memory and crash.
5. **Incorrect handling of multiple solutions.** The problem statement states that there is only one unique minimum value of ```c(a)```. However, it is possible that there are multiple solutions to the problem. In this case, the program must choose one of the solutions arbitrarily.
6. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not always correctly formatted, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the output contains a space instead of a newline, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

Title:
CODEFORCES 385_B. Bear and Strings

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**. The input should be a string of lowercase English letters, and the length of the string should be between 1 and 5000. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to process it correctly and will output an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect use of string functions**. The program should use the correct string functions to process the input string. For example, the `len()` function can be used to get the length of the string, and the `find()` function can be used to find a substring in the string. If the wrong string functions are used, the program will not be able to process the input correctly and will output an incorrect answer.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program should use the correct logic to count the number of pairs of indices that satisfy the given conditions. For example, the program should consider all possible substrings of the input string, and it should count the number of substrings that contain the substring "bear". If the logic is incorrect, the program will not be able to count the number of pairs of indices correctly and will output an incorrect answer.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. The program should be careful to avoid off-by-one errors. For example, when counting the number of substrings that contain the substring "bear", the program should make sure to include the substring "bear" itself in the count. If an off-by-one error occurs, the program will output an incorrect answer.
5. **Memory leaks**. The program should be careful to avoid memory leaks. For example, the program should free any memory that it allocates. If a memory leak occurs, the program may eventually crash or run out of memory.

Title:
CODEFORCES 406_A. Unusual Product

Pain points:
```
The most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem are:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format of the problem is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the solution. For example, if the input contains a row with more than n elements, or if the input contains a row with fewer than n elements, the solution will not work correctly.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format of the problem is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the solution. For example, if the output contains more than one unusual square of A, or if the output contains a value that is not a binary digit, the solution will not work correctly.
* **Incorrect calculation of the unusual square of A:** The unusual square of A is a sum of n dot products, and each dot product is a sum of the products of the corresponding components of two vectors. If the calculation of any of these sums is incorrect, the solution will not work correctly.
* **Incorrect handling of queries:** The problem specifies that Chris has to process q queries, and each query can be one of three types. If the queries are not correctly handled, the solution will not work correctly.

Here are some specific examples of bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrect input format:** The input format of the problem specifies that the first line of input contains an integer n, which is the number of rows and columns in the matrix A. If the input does not contain an integer n, or if the integer n is not a positive integer, the solution will not work correctly.
* **Incorrect output format:** The output format of the problem specifies that the output should be a single string s of length m, where the i-th symbol of s is the value of the unusual square of A for the i-th query of the 3rd type as it appears in the input. If the output does not contain a single string s, or if the length of s is not equal to m, the solution will not work correctly.
* **Incorrect calculation of the unusual square of A:** The unusual square of A is a sum of n dot products, and each dot product is a sum of the products of the corresponding components of two vectors. If the calculation of any of these sums is incorrect, the solution will not work correctly. For example, if the calculation of the dot product of two vectors is incorrect, the solution will not work correctly.
* **Incorrect handling of queries:** The problem specifies that Chris has to process q queries, and each query can be one of three types. If the queries are not correctly handled, the solution will not work correctly. For example, if a query of type 1 is not correctly handled, the solution will not work correctly.

2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong type, which will lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a string instead of an integer, it will be interpreted as the number 0.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When iterating over the input data, it is easy to make a mistake and skip one or more elements. This can lead to incorrect results.
4. **Indexing errors**. When accessing elements of an array or other data structure, it is easy to make a mistake and index out of bounds. This can lead to incorrect results or even a program crash.
5. **Logic errors**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the program does not properly handle boundary conditions, it may produce incorrect results.
6. **Memory leaks**. The program may not properly free memory that it has allocated, which can lead to a memory leak. This can eventually cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
7. **Race conditions**. If multiple threads are accessing the same data concurrently, it is possible for a race condition to occur. This can lead to incorrect results or even a program crash.
8. **Deadlocks**. If multiple threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, it is possible for a deadlock to occur. This can prevent any of the threads from making progress and eventually cause the program to hang.
9. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may contain security vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system. For example, the program may not properly validate user input, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the program.

CODEFORCES 478_B. Random Teams

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line of input should contain two integers n and m, separated by a single space. However, a developer may accidentally mistype the input format and expect the first line to contain only one integer n. This would cause the program to crash when it tries to read the second integer m.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of pairs of friends**. The minimum number of pairs of friends is equal to the number of participants divided by the number of teams. However, a developer may accidentally divide the number of participants by the number of teams minus 1. This would result in an incorrect calculation of the minimum number of pairs of friends.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of pairs of friends**. The maximum number of pairs of friends is equal to the number of participants minus the number of teams plus 1. However, a developer may accidentally add the number of teams instead of subtracting it. This would result in an incorrect calculation of the maximum number of pairs of friends.
4. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the output should contain two integers kmin and kmax, separated by a single space. However, a developer may accidentally output only one integer kmin or kmax. This would cause the program to produce an incorrect output.
5. **Other bugs**. There are a number of other potential bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem. These include:
    * Using the wrong data type to store the number of participants or the number of teams.
    * Using the wrong operator to divide the number of participants by the number of teams.
    * Forgetting to initialize variables before using them.
    * Making a mistake in the logic of the program.

By following the tips below, you can help to avoid these common problems and bugs:

1. Carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand the input and output formats.
2. Test your program with a variety of input values to make sure it produces the correct output.
3. Use the debugger to help you track down any errors in your code.
4. Ask for help from a mentor or other experienced programmer if you are stuck.

Title:
CODEFORCES 621_E. Wet Shark and Blocks

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo operator**

When working with modulo arithmetic, it is important to use the correct modulo operator. In this problem, the modulo operator is x, which means that the remainder of a division by x is taken. For example, 10 mod 3 is 1, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.

**2. Using the wrong data type**

The input data for this problem is given as integers. However, it is possible to make a mistake and use a data type that is not large enough to store the values. For example, if the input data is 1000000000, and you try to store it in an integer variable, you will get an overflow error.

**3. Using the wrong algorithm**

The algorithm that you use to solve this problem must be correct. If the algorithm is incorrect, you will get the wrong answer. For example, if you try to solve the problem by brute force, you will not be able to finish in time.

**4. Not handling special cases**

The input data for this problem may contain special cases. For example, the input data may contain a zero or a negative number. If you do not handle these special cases correctly, you will get the wrong answer.

**5. Not using the correct data structures**

The data structures that you use to solve this problem must be appropriate for the task. For example, if you need to store a large amount of data, you should use a data structure that is designed for that purpose.

**6. Not using the correct libraries**

There are a number of libraries that can be used to help you solve this problem. For example, the math library contains functions that can be used to perform modulo arithmetic. If you do not use the correct libraries, you will have to write your own code, which can be more difficult and error-prone.

CODEFORCES 643_C. Levels and Regions

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is very specific. It is important to make sure that you are reading the input correctly, and that you are not making any mistakes when parsing the data. For example, if you accidentally read the number of levels as a string instead of an integer, your program will not work correctly.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output for this problem is a floating-point number. It is important to make sure that you are formatting your output correctly, and that you are not rounding it to the wrong number of decimal places. For example, if you round your output to the nearest integer, your program will not be correct.

**3. Incorrect algorithm**

The algorithm that you use to solve this problem is very important. If you use an incorrect algorithm, your program will not be correct. For example, if you try to solve this problem using a brute-force approach, your program will not be able to solve large instances of the problem in a reasonable amount of time.

**4. Incorrect data structures**

The data structures that you use to solve this problem are also very important. If you use incorrect data structures, your program will not be able to solve the problem efficiently. For example, if you try to solve this problem using a linked list, your program will not be able to solve large instances of the problem in a reasonable amount of time.

**5. Incorrect implementation**

Finally, the implementation of your program is also very important. If you make any mistakes in your implementation, your program will not be correct. For example, if you forget to initialize a variable, your program will not work correctly.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always correctly followed, which can lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input contains a number that is not an integer, the program may crash.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format must be exactly as specified in the problem statement. For example, if the output contains a decimal point, the program may be incorrect.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** When counting the number of "xor-sequences", it is important to make sure that you do not count any sequences twice. For example, if you are counting the number of sequences of length 3, you need to make sure that you do not count the sequence (1, 2, 3) twice.
4. **Arithmetic errors.** When performing arithmetic operations, it is important to make sure that you use the correct data types. For example, if you are adding two integers, you need to make sure that both integers are of the same data type.
5. **Memory errors.** When allocating memory for variables, it is important to make sure that you allocate enough memory. For example, if you are creating an array of size n, you need to make sure that you allocate enough memory for n elements.
6. **Logic errors.** When writing the logic for your program, it is important to make sure that your code is correct. For example, if you are checking if a number is divisible by 3, you need to make sure that you are using the correct algorithm.

Title:
CODEFORCES 716_E. Digit Tree

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format of the problem is not strictly followed. For example, the input may contain a number that is not an integer, or it may contain a number that is out of the specified range. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect data type**

The data type of the input and output values must be correctly specified. For example, the input values should be integers, and the output value should be a number. If the data types are not correctly specified, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a programmer accidentally miscounts by one. For example, a programmer might accidentally write a loop that iterates one too many times or one too few times. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output or crash.

**4. Undefined behavior**

Undefined behavior occurs when a program does something that is not specified in the language's definition. For example, a program might divide by zero or access a memory location that is not allocated. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**5. Memory leaks**

Memory leaks occur when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

**6. Race conditions**

Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can cause the program to produce incorrect output or crash.

**7. Deadlocks**

Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, and neither thread can proceed. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely.

**8. Stack overflows**

Stack overflows occur when a program uses up all of the available stack space. This can cause the program to crash.

**9. Buffer overflows**

Buffer overflows occur when a program writes data to a buffer that is not large enough to hold the data. This can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.

**10. Format string vulnerabilities**

Format string vulnerabilities occur when a program uses a format string that is not properly sanitized. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

CODEFORCES 737_B. Sea Battle

Pain points:

 **1. The input format is not correct.** The input format should be four integers, n, a, b, and k, followed by a string of length n. However, the input format in the problem statement is incorrect. It should be:

```
n, a, b, k
s
```

where n, a, b, and k are integers and s is a string.

**2. The output format is not correct.** The output format should be two integers, the minimum number of cells that Galya needs to shoot at and the list of cells that she should shoot at. However, the output format in the problem statement is incorrect. It should be:

```
m
c1 c2 ... cm
```

where m is the minimum number of cells that Galya needs to shoot at and c1, c2, ..., cm are the cells that she should shoot at.

**3. The problem is not well-defined.** The problem statement does not specify what happens if Galya shoots at a cell that is not part of any ship. Does she hit the ship or does she miss? This is an important detail that needs to be clarified in the problem statement.

**4. The problem is too easy.** The problem can be solved in a few lines of code. There is no need to use any advanced data structures or algorithms.

**5. The problem is too hard.** The problem is difficult to solve even for experienced programmers. It requires a deep understanding of the problem and a lot of creativity to come up with a solution.

Title:
CODEFORCES 761_A. Dasha and Stairs

Pain points:
**1. Using incorrect data types**

The input contains two integers, so the developer should use `int` or `long` data types to store them. Using `float` or `double` data types may lead to incorrect results.

**2. Using incorrect operators**

The problem statement says that `a` and `b` are non-negative integers. So the developer should use the following operators to compare them: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`. Using other operators, such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, may lead to incorrect results.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The problem statement says that there is an interval of steps from the `l-th` to the `r-th` (1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r`), for which values that Dasha has found are correct. So the developer should check if `l` is less than or equal to `r` and if `a` is less than or equal to `b`.

**4. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement does not specify what to do if `a` is equal to `0` or `b` is equal to `0`. The developer should handle these edge cases by returning `NO` in such cases.

**5. Using incorrect code style**

The developer should use a consistent code style. This will make the code easier to read and understand.

**6. Not commenting the code**

The developer should comment the code to explain what it does. This will make the code easier to understand for other developers.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may contain a negative number or a number greater than 11.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer.
3. **Off-by-one error.** The developer may accidentally add or subtract 1 from the answer.
4. **Incorrect algorithm.** The developer may use an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the developer may use a brute-force algorithm that takes O(n^2) time, when a more efficient algorithm exists.
5. **Memory leak.** The developer may not free the memory that is allocated during the execution of the program. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
6. **Stack overflow.** The developer may write a recursive function that calls itself too many times, causing the stack to overflow. This can also cause the program to crash.
7. **Garbage in, garbage out.** The developer may use incorrect input data to test the program. This can lead to incorrect results, which can make it difficult to debug the program.
8. **Divide by zero error.** The developer may divide by zero, which will cause the program to crash.
9. **Null pointer exception.** The developer may attempt to access a null pointer, which will cause the program to crash.
10. **Type error.** The developer may use the wrong type for a variable, which can lead to incorrect results or a program crash.
11. **Synchronization error.** The developer may not synchronize access to shared data, which can lead to race conditions and incorrect results.
12. **Deadlock.** The developer may create a deadlock, which can prevent the program from making progress.
13. **Timeout.** The developer may not handle timeouts correctly, which can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.
14. **Security vulnerability.** The developer may write code that is vulnerable to attack, such as a buffer overflow or a SQL injection attack. This can allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the program or the system.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not correct. For example, the input may contain a non-integer number, or it may not have a single integer.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not correct. For example, the output may contain a string that is not a valid palindrome, or it may not have a single string.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program is incorrect. For example, the program may not find all the palindromes in the string, or it may find palindromes that are not of length 3.
4. **Incorrect data structures**. The data structures used by the program may be incorrect. For example, the program may use a data structure that is not efficient for finding palindromes, or it may use a data structure that is not efficient for storing the strings.
5. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used by the program may be incorrect. For example, the algorithm may not be able to find all the palindromes in the string, or it may not be able to find the palindromes in a time-efficient manner.

Title:
CODEFORCES 830_B. Cards Sorting

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n, and the second line should contain a sequence of n integers. However, a developer may accidentally write the input format incorrectly, for example, by specifying that the first line should contain two integers n and m. This would cause the program to crash when it tries to read the second line.
2. **Incorrect data type.** The input format specifies that the first line should contain a single integer n, and the second line should contain a sequence of n integers. However, a developer may accidentally read the first line as a sequence of integers, or the second line as a single integer. This would cause the program to crash or produce incorrect output.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** The problem states that Vasily takes the top card from the deck, and if the number on it equals the minimum number written on the cards in the deck, then he places the card away. Otherwise, he puts it under the deck and takes the next card from the top. This means that the number of times Vasily takes the top card from the deck is one more than the number of cards in the deck that have a number less than or equal to the minimum number. However, a developer may accidentally add or subtract one to this number, which would cause the program to produce incorrect output.
4. **Incorrect logic.** The problem states that Vasily takes the top card from the deck, and if the number on it equals the minimum number written on the cards in the deck, then he places the card away. Otherwise, he puts it under the deck and takes the next card from the top. This means that the number of times Vasily takes the top card from the deck is one more than the number of cards in the deck that have a number less than or equal to the minimum number. However, a developer may accidentally implement the logic incorrectly, for example, by not checking if the number on the top card is less than or equal to the minimum number. This would cause the program to produce incorrect output.
5. **Memory leaks.** The program may allocate memory that it does not free, which can eventually lead to a memory leak. This can cause the program to crash or run out of memory.
6. **Race conditions.** The program may access shared data without the proper synchronization, which can lead to data corruption or incorrect results.
7. **Security vulnerabilities.** The program may be vulnerable to attacks such as buffer overflows or SQL injection. This can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the program or its data.

Title:
CODEFORCES 851_C. Five Dimensional Points

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format specifies that the first line of input should contain a single integer n. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format specifies that the first line of output should contain a single integer k, which is the number of good points. The second line of output should contain k integers, each on its own line, which are the indices of the good points in ascending order. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly output the results and will likely crash.
3. **Incorrect calculation of angles**. The angle between two vectors in 5-dimensional space is defined as <image>, where <image> is the scalar product and <image> is the length of <image>. If the calculation of angles is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly identify which points are good and which points are bad.
4. **Incorrect identification of good points**. The program must correctly identify which points are good and which points are bad. If the program incorrectly identifies a good point as bad, or a bad point as good, the output will be incorrect.
5. **Incorrect sorting of good points**. The program must correctly sort the good points in ascending order. If the good points are not sorted correctly, the output will be incorrect.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to carefully implement the algorithm for calculating angles and identifying good points. Finally, it is important to carefully test the program to ensure that it produces the correct output.

Title:
HACKEREARTH climbing-ladder-1

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of Euler's totient function.** The Euler's totient function, also known as Euler's phi function, is a function that counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to a given integer that are coprime to that integer. It is denoted by $\phi(n)$. A positive integer $x$ is said to be coprime to a positive integer $n$ if the greatest common divisor of $x$ and $n$ is 1.

A common mistake that developers make when implementing Euler's totient function is to use the following formula:

```
$\phi(n) = n \prod_{p \mid n} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{p} \right)$
```

where $p$ is a prime number that divides $n$. However, this formula is incorrect for composite numbers $n$. The correct formula for Euler's totient function is:

```
$\phi(n) = n \prod_{p \mid n, p \text{ prime}} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{p} \right)$
```

2. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator, also known as the remainder operator, is a binary operator that gives the remainder of dividing the first operand by the second operand. It is denoted by the symbol `%`.

A common mistake that developers make when using the modulo operator is to use it to check if a number is divisible by another number. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
if (n % m == 0) {
  // n is divisible by m
}
```

This code will not work correctly if $m$ is negative. The correct way to check if a number is divisible by another number is to use the following code:

```
if (n % m == 0 && m > 0) {
  // n is divisible by m
}
```

3. **Incorrect use of the bitwise operators.** The bitwise operators are a set of operators that perform operations on the bits of a binary number. The most common bitwise operators are the AND operator (`&`), the OR operator (`|`), the XOR operator (`^`), and the NOT operator (`~`).

A common mistake that developers make when using the bitwise operators is to use them incorrectly. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
x = x & 1;
```

This code will not work correctly because the bitwise AND operator only works on two operands. The correct way to write this code is:

```
x = x & (1 << 0);
```

4. **Incorrect use of the conditional operator.** The conditional operator, also known as the ternary operator, is a ternary operator that takes three operands and returns one of them based on a condition. It is denoted by the symbol `? :`.

A common mistake that developers make when using the conditional operator is to use it incorrectly. For example, the following code is incorrect:

```
x = y ? z : z;
```

This code will not work correctly because the conditional operator only works on two operands. The correct way to write this code is:

```
x = y ? z : w;

HACKEREARTH even-odd-5

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect indexing:** The input matrix is 1-indexed, but the developer may accidentally use 0-indexing. This would result in incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculation of even and odd numbers:** The developer may incorrectly calculate the number of even and odd numbers in the submatrix. For example, they may count the number of even numbers in the submatrix as the number of even numbers in the entire matrix, or they may count the number of odd numbers in the submatrix as the number of odd numbers in the entire matrix.
3. **Off-by-one errors:** The developer may make off-by-one errors when calculating the number of even and odd numbers in the submatrix. For example, they may forget to include the first row or column of the submatrix in their calculations.
4. **Memory errors:** The developer may not allocate enough memory to store the submatrix. This could result in a segmentation fault or other runtime error.
5. **Time complexity:** The developer's solution may have a time complexity that is too high. For example, they may use a brute-force algorithm to solve the problem.
6. **Space complexity:** The developer's solution may have a space complexity that is too high. For example, they may store the entire submatrix in memory.

Title:
HACKEREARTH magic-inversion

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.** This algorithm is used to find all prime numbers up to a given integer. A common mistake is to iterate over the integers from 2 to the given integer, instead of from 2 to the square root of the given integer. This will result in some composite numbers being incorrectly identified as prime.
2. **Using a naive algorithm to count the number of inversions.** A naive algorithm would iterate over all pairs of elements in the two arrays, and check if the element in the first array is greater than the element in the second array. This would take O(N^2) time. A more efficient algorithm would use a divide and conquer approach to count the number of inversions in each half of the arrays, and then add the two counts together. This would take O(N log N) time.
3. **Not handling the case where the two arrays are the same.** If the two arrays are the same, then there will be no inversions. A common mistake is to forget to check for this case, and then incorrectly count the number of inversions as being equal to the number of elements in the arrays.
4. **Not handling the case where one of the arrays is empty.** If one of the arrays is empty, then there will be no inversions. A common mistake is to forget to check for this case, and then incorrectly count the number of inversions as being equal to the number of elements in the other array.
5. **Not handling the case where the input is invalid.** The input may be invalid for a number of reasons, such as if the number of elements in the arrays is not equal, or if the elements in the arrays are not integers. A common mistake is to not check for invalid input, and then incorrectly output the answer.

1. **Incorrectly using the inclusive range [l,r].** The question states that the range is inclusive, so the answer should include the values l and r. However, some developers may mistakenly exclude these values from the range, resulting in an incorrect answer.
2. **Using the wrong data type for the array A.** The question states that the array A contains integers, so the developer should use an integer data type for the array. However, some developers may mistakenly use a floating-point data type, which could lead to incorrect results.
3. **Not handling the case where there is no greater number than X in the specified range.** The question states that the answer should be -1 if there is no greater number than X in the specified range. However, some developers may forget to check for this case, resulting in an incorrect answer.
4. **Using an inefficient algorithm.** The problem can be solved in O(n) time using a binary search. However, some developers may use a more inefficient algorithm, such as a linear search, which could lead to a slower runtime.
5. **Not handling edge cases.** The problem has a few edge cases that the developer should be aware of. For example, the array A could be empty, or the range [l,r] could be empty. The developer should make sure to handle these cases correctly.

Pain points:
1. The input format is not clear. Is it T lines, each with one integer N? Or is it one line with T integers?
2. The output format is not clear. Is it one line with T strings, each "CORRECT" or "INCORRECT"? Or is it one line with T integers?
3. The problem statement does not specify what happens if the input is not valid. For example, what if T is negative? Or what if N is not an integer?
4. The problem statement does not specify what happens if the output is not valid. For example, what if the output is not a string? Or what if the output is not one of "CORRECT" or "INCORRECT"?
5. The problem statement does not specify how to handle overflow. For example, what if N is larger than the maximum integer that can be represented?
6. The problem statement does not specify how to handle underflow. For example, what if N is smaller than the minimum integer that can be represented?
7. The problem statement does not specify how to handle errors. For example, what if there is a memory allocation error? Or what if there is a divide by zero error?

Title:
HACKEREARTH sherlock-and-magic

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable type**. The input is a list of lists, but the developer may mistakenly treat it as a list of strings. This will lead to errors when trying to access the elements of the list.
2. **Off-by-one error**. The developer may incorrectly calculate the position of the criminals at each time step. This will lead to incorrect results.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The developer may incorrectly implement the logic for determining when two criminals meet. This will lead to incorrect results.
4. **Memory leak**. The developer may not properly free the memory allocated for the data structures used in the solution. This can lead to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
5. **Timeout**. The developer may not implement the solution in a time-efficient manner. This can lead to the solution timing out, which will result in a failed test case.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. It is also important to test the solution thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and efficient.

Title:
HACKEREARTH the-confused-monk

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of modulus operator.** The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. In the problem statement, we are given that the value of the MonkQuotient is 10^9 + 7. This means that if we divide any number by MonkQuotient, the remainder will always be less than MonkQuotient. Therefore, we need to make sure that we use the modulus operator correctly when calculating the answer.
2. **Incorrect use of exponentiation operator.** The exponentiation operator (**) raises a number to a power. In the problem statement, we are given that we need to calculate the value of (f(x)^g(x)) % MonkQuotient. This means that we need to first calculate the value of f(x)^g(x), and then take the modulus of that value with respect to MonkQuotient.
3. **Incorrect use of the GCD function.** The GCD function (gcd()) returns the greatest common divisor of two numbers. In the problem statement, we are given that we need to calculate the value of g(x), which is the GCD of the elements of the array. Therefore, we need to make sure that we use the GCD function correctly when calculating the value of g(x).
4. **Incorrect use of the product operator.** The product operator (*) multiplies two numbers together. In the problem statement, we are given that we need to calculate the value of f(x), which is the product of the elements of the array. Therefore, we need to make sure that we use the product operator correctly when calculating the value of f(x).
5. **Incorrect use of the input function.** The input function (input()) reads a line of input from the user. In the problem statement, we are given that the first line of input will contain an integer — N. This means that we need to use the input function to read the value of N.
6. **Incorrect use of the output function.** The output function (print()) prints a line of output to the console. In the problem statement, we are given that we need to print the required answer of the equation. Therefore, we need to make sure that we use the output function correctly when printing the answer.

Title:
ATCODER p02653 AtCoder Grand Contest 045 - Range Set

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong modulo**

When computing the number of different strings that x can be, it is important to use the correct modulo. In this problem, the modulo is (10^9+7). If you use the wrong modulo, your answer will be incorrect.

**2. Not handling the case where A or B is 0**

The problem states that Snuke can do the following two operations any number of times in any order:

* Choose A consecutive characters in x and replace each of them with `0`.
* Choose B consecutive characters in x and replace each of them with `1`.

If A or B is 0, then Snuke cannot do that operation. In this case, you need to handle the situation separately.

**3. Not handling the case where N is small**

The problem states that N is at most 5000. If N is small, then you can brute force the answer. However, if N is large, then you need to use a more efficient algorithm.

**4. Not using the Chinese remainder theorem**

The Chinese remainder theorem is a powerful tool that can be used to solve problems involving multiple modulos. In this problem, we can use the Chinese remainder theorem to reduce the problem to a problem modulo (A+B).

**5. Not using fast exponentiation**

When computing the number of different strings that x can be, it is important to use fast exponentiation. Fast exponentiation is a technique that can be used to compute powers of a number quickly. In this problem, we can use fast exponentiation to compute (A+B)^(N-1) modulo (10^9+7).

Title:
ATCODER p02782 AtCoder Beginner Contest 154 - Many Many Paths

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the f(r, c) function.** The f(r, c) function should return the number of paths from the point (0, 0) to the point (r, c) that Snuke can trace by repeating the operation above. A common mistake is to return the number of paths from the point (0, 0) to the point (r, c) that Snuke can trace in **exactly** `r` steps and `c` steps.
2. **Incorrect calculation of the modulo.** The sum of f(i, j) over all pair of integers (i, j) such that r_1 ≤ i ≤ r_2 and c_1 ≤ j ≤ c_2 should be computed modulo (10^9+7). A common mistake is to forget to perform the modulo operation.
3. **Incorrect input parsing.** The input is given in the format `r_1 c_1 r_2 c_2`. A common mistake is to parse the input incorrectly, for example, by reading `r_1 c_1` as a single integer.
4. **Incorrect output formatting.** The output should be printed in the format `<sum of f(i, j)>`. A common mistake is to print the output in the format `<sum of f(i, j)> % (10^9+7)`.

ATCODER p03344 AtCoder Regular Contest 098 - Donation

Pain points:
**Possible Problems**

* The input format is not clear. For example, it is not clear whether the first line of input contains the number of vertices `N` and the number of edges `M`, or whether it contains the first vertex's `A` and `B` values.
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if the player runs out of money. Does the player lose the game? Or does the player simply stay at the current vertex?
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if the player tries to move to a vertex that they are not connected to. Does the player lose the game? Or does the player simply stay at the current vertex?
* The problem statement does not specify what happens if the player tries to donate more money than they have in their pocket. Does the player lose the game? Or does the player simply donate the amount of money that they have?

**Possible Bugs**

* The player may not be able to win the game if they start with too little money. For example, if the player starts with `W = 0`, then they will not be able to donate any money to any vertices.
* The player may not be able to win the game if they start with too much money. For example, if the player starts with `W = 10^10`, then they will not be able to move to any vertices that have `A > 10^10`.
* The player may not be able to win the game if they make a mistake in their strategy. For example, if the player tries to move to a vertex that they are not connected to, then they will lose the game.
* The player may not be able to win the game if they run out of time. For example, if the player has to donate a large amount of money to a vertex, then they may not have enough time to do so before the game ends.

Title:
ATCODER p03820 AtCoder Regular Contest 068 - Solitaire

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the deque data structure.** The deque data structure is a doubly-ended queue, which means that it can be accessed from both the front and the back. This can be a source of errors if the implementation is not done correctly. For example, if the deque is not properly initialized, it may be possible to access elements that do not exist, or to modify elements that have already been removed from the deque.

**2. Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The problem statement specifies that N and K are both non-negative integers, and that N is less than or equal to 2000. However, it is possible for a developer to accidentally write code that does not handle these edge cases correctly. For example, if the code attempts to access an element of the deque that does not exist, this will cause a runtime error.

**3. Incorrect use of modulo arithmetic.** The problem statement specifies that the answer should be printed modulo 10^9 + 7. This means that the developer must take care to ensure that all calculations are done modulo 10^9 + 7. For example, if the developer accidentally adds two numbers that are not modulo 10^9 + 7, the result will be incorrect.

**4. Incorrect use of the Sieve of Eratosthenes.** The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a very efficient algorithm for finding all of the prime numbers up to a given limit. However, it is important to use the Sieve of Eratosthenes correctly. For example, if the developer does not initialize the sieve correctly, it may not find all of the prime numbers.

**5. Incorrect use of the Chinese remainder theorem.** The Chinese remainder theorem is a powerful tool for solving systems of linear congruences. However, it is important to use the Chinese remainder theorem correctly. For example, if the developer does not choose the moduli correctly, the Chinese remainder theorem may not produce the correct solution.

Title:
ATCODER p03987 AtCoder Grand Contest 005 - Minimum Sum

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a list of integers. If we use a 32-bit integer to store the sum, we may get an overflow error. To avoid this, we can use a 64-bit integer.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The naive algorithm for this problem is to iterate over all possible permutations of the input list and find the one with the smallest sum. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(N!). A more efficient algorithm is to use dynamic programming.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

The input data may contain invalid values, such as negative integers or numbers greater than N. We need to make sure to handle these edge cases correctly.

**4. Not using the right data structures**

The input data is a list of integers. We can use a list to store the input data, but a more efficient data structure would be a heap. A heap allows us to quickly find the smallest element in the list, which is essential for the dynamic programming algorithm.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code thoroughly before submitting it to a competition. This will help you catch any bugs and ensure that your code is correct.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect BMI calculation**. The BMI formula is given in the problem statement, but it is easy to make a mistake when implementing it. Make sure to double-check your calculations.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output should be a list of student ID numbers separated by spaces, in the same order as they were input. Make sure to format your output correctly.
3. **Incorrect data handling**. The input data may contain invalid values, such as negative weights or heights. Make sure to handle these values gracefully.
4. **Memory leaks**. Be careful not to allocate memory that you don't need, and to free memory that you no longer need.
5. **Race conditions**. If multiple threads are accessing the same data, you need to take care to ensure that the data is always consistent.
6. **Deadlocks**. If multiple threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, you could end up with a deadlock situation where no thread can progress.

Title:
AIZU p00574 Snake Escaping

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect variable types**. The input is a string, but the code tries to convert it to an integer. This will cause a ValueError.
2. **Incorrect variable names**. The variable `l` is used to store the number of days, but the code tries to use it to store the number of parts. This will cause a NameError.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. The code iterates over the list of complaints one element too many, causing it to miss the last complaint. This will result in an incorrect answer.
4. **Incorrect logic**. The code incorrectly calculates the total toxicity of the escaped snakes. It should add the toxicity of all the snakes that have escaped, not just the ones that have been captured.
5. **Memory errors**. The code uses a lot of memory, which can cause it to run out of memory and crash.

To avoid these problems, you should:

1. Make sure that the input is in the correct format.
2. Use the correct variable types for your variables.
3. Give your variables descriptive names.
4. Check your code carefully for off-by-one errors.
5. Make sure that your logic is correct.
6. Use the `sys.getsizeof()` function to check the memory usage of your code.

Title:
AIZU p01423 Rabbit Party

Pain points:
**1. Using an adjacency list to represent the graph**

An adjacency list is a data structure that represents a graph as a list of lists. Each list in the adjacency list represents the neighbors of a vertex in the graph. This data structure is easy to implement and efficient to use for many graph algorithms. However, it can be inefficient for graphs with a large number of vertices or edges.

**2. Using a priority queue to find the minimum friendliness**

A priority queue is a data structure that stores elements in a sorted order. The elements are added to the priority queue in the order in which they are inserted, and the elements are removed from the priority queue in the order of their priority. This data structure is efficient for finding the minimum element in a set of elements. However, it can be inefficient for graphs with a large number of vertices or edges.

**3. Using a brute force approach to find the maximum satisfaction score**

A brute force approach to finding the maximum satisfaction score would be to consider all possible subsets of rabbits and to calculate the satisfaction score for each subset. The subset with the maximum satisfaction score would be the answer. This approach is inefficient for graphs with a large number of vertices or edges.

**4. Using a dynamic programming approach to find the maximum satisfaction score**

A dynamic programming approach to finding the maximum satisfaction score would be to build a table of the maximum satisfaction score for all possible subsets of rabbits. The table would be initialized to 0, and the entries would be filled in one by one. The entry for a subset of rabbits would be the maximum of the satisfaction scores for all subsets of the subset that do not include the rabbit with the minimum friendliness. This approach is efficient for graphs with a large number of vertices or edges.

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not clear.**

The input format is not clear. It is not clear how to represent the coordinates of a hill. Is it x,y? Or is it (x,y)?

**2. The output format is not clear.**

The output format is not clear. It is not clear how to represent the area. Is it a floating-point number? Or is it an integer?

**3. The problem statement is not clear.**

The problem statement is not clear. It is not clear what is meant by "the maximum area you can protect". Is it the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed by the four hills? Or is it the area of the smallest circle that can be inscribed in the four hills?

**4. The algorithm is not correct.**

The algorithm is not correct. It does not always find the maximum area that can be protected. For example, if the four hills are located at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1), the algorithm will find an area of 1.0, but the maximum area that can be protected is 2.0.

**5. The algorithm is not efficient.**

The algorithm is not efficient. It takes O(N^2) time to run, where N is the number of hills. There are more efficient algorithms that can find the maximum area that can be protected in O(N) time.

Title:
AIZU p02158 Rings

Pain points:
**Possible Problems and Bugs**

* **Incorrect implementation of the parabola equation.** The parabola equation is given by $y = ax^2 + bx + c$. If the implementation is incorrect, the dolphin's trajectory may not intersect the line segments connecting the rings.
* **Incorrect calculation of the initial velocity.** The initial velocity is given by $v = \sqrt{2gy}$, where $g$ is the gravitational acceleration and $y$ is the maximum height of the parabola. If the calculation of the initial velocity is incorrect, the dolphin may not have enough speed to reach all of the rings.
* **Incorrect calculation of the total physical strength required.** The total physical strength required is given by $\sum_{i=1}^n v_i$, where $v_i$ is the initial velocity for the $i$th jump. If the calculation of the total physical strength is incorrect, the answer will be incorrect.
* **Incorrect input handling.** The input is given in the format of $T$ $N$ $X_1$ $L_1$ $H_1$ $\ldots$ $X_N$ $L_N$ $H_N$. If the input is not handled correctly, the program may crash or produce incorrect output.
* **Incorrect output formatting.** The output should be a single floating-point number with an absolute or relative error of less than $10^{-9}$. If the output is not formatted correctly, it will be incorrect.

**How to Avoid These Problems**

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read the problem statement and understand the constraints. It is also important to carefully implement the parabola equation and the calculation of the initial velocity and total physical strength. Finally, it is important to handle the input and output correctly.

Here are some specific tips for avoiding these problems:

* Use a reputable online resource to learn the parabola equation.
* Use a computer algebra system to verify that your implementation of the parabola equation is correct.
* Use a calculator to verify that your calculation of the initial velocity and total physical strength is correct.
* Use a unit test framework to test your program for incorrect input handling and output formatting.

By following these tips, you can help to ensure that your program is free of errors and that it produces the correct output.
