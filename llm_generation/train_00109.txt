CODECHEF cdsw153

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect implementation of the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.** This is a common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. The sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple but efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit. It works by iteratively marking all multiples of each prime number as composite, starting with 2. The first step is to initialize a boolean array `isPrime` of size `n + 1` (where `n` is the given limit) to all `true`. Then, for each prime number `p`, we mark all multiples of `p` as composite by setting `isPrime[p * i]` to `false` for all `i` from 2 to `n / p`.
2. **Off-by-one errors.** These are another common mistake that can lead to incorrect results. It is important to make sure that all of the numbers in the range `L` to `R` are included in the count. For example, if `L = 1` and `R = 10`, then the count should be 11, not 10.
3. **Incorrect use of the modulo operator.** The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder of a division operation. It is important to make sure that you are using the modulo operator correctly, especially when dealing with negative numbers. For example, `10 % 5` is 0, not 5.
4. **Incorrect use of the division operator.** The division operator `/` returns the quotient of a division operation. It is important to make sure that you are using the division operator correctly, especially when dealing with negative numbers. For example, `10 / 5` is 2, not 5.
5. **Incorrect use of the bitwise operators.** The bitwise operators `&`, `|`, and `^` are used to perform bitwise operations on binary numbers. It is important to make sure that you are using the bitwise operators correctly, especially when dealing with negative numbers. For example, `10 & 5` is 0, not 5.
6. **Incorrect use of the logical operators.** The logical operators `&&`, `||`, and `!` are used to perform logical operations on boolean values. It is important to make sure that you are using the logical operators correctly, especially when dealing with multiple conditions. For example, `(a == 1) && (b == 2)` is true if both `a` and `b` are equal to 1, not if either `a` or `b` is equal to 1.
7. **Incorrect use of the conditional operator.** The conditional operator `?:` is used to evaluate a condition and return one of two values based on the result. It is important to make sure that you are using the conditional operator correctly, especially when dealing with multiple conditions. For example, `x = (a == 1) ? 1 : 2` is assigned the value 1 if `a` is equal to 1, not 2.
8. **Incorrect use of the for loop.** The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence of values. It is important to make sure that you are using the for loop correctly, especially when dealing with infinite sequences. For example, the following for loop will never terminate: `for (int i = 0;; i++) {}`.
9. **Incorrect use of the while loop.** The while loop is used to iterate over a sequence of values as long as a condition is met. It is important to make sure that you are using the while loop correctly, especially when dealing with infinite sequences. For example, the following while loop will never terminate: `while (true) {}`.
10. **Incorrect use of the do-while loop.** The do-while loop is used to iterate over a sequence of values as long as a condition is met. It is important to make sure that you are using the do-while loop correctly, especially when dealing with infinite sequences. For example, the following do-while loop will never terminate: `do {}` while (true).

Title:
CODECHEF rmath

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The problem states that the input numbers `x` and `y` are integers. However, if we accidentally use a floating-point data type, we may get incorrect results. For example, if we use `float` to store the numbers `205` and `402`, the sum `205 + 402` will be `607.0` instead of `607`.

**2. Not handling the edge cases**

The problem states that the input numbers `x` and `y` do not have leading zeroes. However, if we accidentally input numbers with leading zeroes, our code may not work correctly. For example, if we input the number `001`, our code may think that it is a zero and return the wrong answer.

**3. Using incorrect logic**

The problem states that if `x + y = z` remains correct after removing zeroes from it, then Ron's assumption is correct. However, if we accidentally use incorrect logic, we may get incorrect results. For example, if we assume that `x + y = z` always remains correct after removing zeroes from it, our code will always return `YES`, even if the input numbers do not satisfy the equation.

**4. Not handling errors correctly**

The problem does not specify what to do if there is an error. If we do not handle errors correctly, our code may crash or give incorrect results. For example, if we try to divide by zero, our code may crash.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code before submitting it. This will help you catch any bugs and errors before they cause problems for other people.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1042_D. Petya and Array

Pain points:
 1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the parsing of the input data. For example, if the input contains a space between two integers, the program may interpret the space as a delimiter and read the two integers as one.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the interpretation of the output data. For example, if the output contains a newline character at the end of the line, the program may interpret the newline character as the end of the output and stop reading.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the number of segments.** The program may incorrectly calculate the number of segments by, for example, counting the same segment multiple times or not counting a segment at all.
4. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The program may use data structures in an incorrect way, which may lead to errors in the calculation of the number of segments. For example, the program may use a hash table to store the sums of segments, but the hash table may not be large enough to store all of the sums.
5. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** The program may use algorithms in an incorrect way, which may lead to errors in the calculation of the number of segments. For example, the program may use a brute-force algorithm to calculate the number of segments, which may be very inefficient.
6. **Incorrect handling of errors.** The program may not handle errors correctly, which may lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect output. For example, the program may not handle the case where the input data is invalid.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1065_C. Make It Equal

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format should be two integers n and k, followed by n space-separated integers h_1, h_2, ..., h_n. Make sure to check that the input is in the correct format before you start processing it.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer, the minimum number of good slices you have to do to make all towers have the same height. Make sure to format your output correctly.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the minimum number of good slices.** The minimum number of good slices is the smallest number of slices that you can make such that the cost of each slice is less than or equal to k. To find the minimum number of good slices, you can start by sorting the heights of the towers in ascending order. Then, you can iterate through the heights of the towers, starting with the smallest height. For each height, you can calculate the cost of the slice and check if it is less than or equal to k. If the cost of the slice is less than or equal to k, then you can increment the number of good slices. Otherwise, you can skip the slice and move on to the next height.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** When you are iterating through the heights of the towers, make sure to check that you are not iterating over the same height twice. For example, if the heights of the towers are 1, 2, 3, and 4, then you should not iterate over the heights 1, 2, and 3 twice.
5. **Memory errors.** If you are using a programming language that has a garbage collector, make sure to free up any memory that you are no longer using. This will help to prevent memory leaks.
6. **Timeout errors.** If you are using a programming language that has a time limit, make sure to write your code in a way that is efficient enough to run within the time limit.
7. **Incorrect use of data structures.** Make sure that you are using the correct data structures for the problem that you are trying to solve. For example, if you are trying to sort a list of integers, you should use a sorted array or a binary search tree.
8. **Incorrect use of algorithms.** Make sure that you are using the correct algorithms for the problem that you are trying to solve. For example, if you are trying to find the minimum element in a list, you should use a binary search algorithm.
9. **Incorrect use of libraries.** Make sure that you are using the correct libraries for the problem that you are trying to solve. For example, if you are trying to read from a file, you should use the `File` class in the Java programming language.

CODEFORCES 1154_E. Two Teams

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

* **Incorrect understanding of the problem statement.** This is the most common mistake that can lead to a wrong solution. Make sure that you understand all the details of the problem before you start coding.
* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** Even if you understand the problem statement correctly, you can still make mistakes when implementing the algorithm. Be careful to avoid common programming errors, such as off-by-one errors and typos.
* **Incorrect test cases.** It is important to test your solution thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly. Make sure to include a variety of test cases, including both positive and negative cases.
* **Incorrect submission.** Once you are confident that your solution is correct, you need to submit it to the judge. Make sure that you follow the submission instructions carefully.

Here are some specific examples of problems that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* The developer may incorrectly assume that the first coach always chooses the student with the highest programming skill. This is not always the case, as the first coach may choose a student with a lower programming skill if it is closer to the middle of the row.
* The developer may incorrectly implement the algorithm for finding the students who are closest to the left and right of the selected student. This can lead to errors in determining which students are chosen by the first and second coaches.
* The developer may incorrectly test their solution. This can lead to errors in identifying bugs in the code.
* The developer may incorrectly submit their solution. This can lead to errors in the judge's evaluation of the solution.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1176_C. Lose it!

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a single line containing the number of elements in the array, followed by a second line containing the elements of the array. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will produce an incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single integer, representing the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array good. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly output the answer and will produce an incorrect result.
3. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm used to solve the problem may be incorrect, resulting in an incorrect output. For example, a naive algorithm that simply iterates through the array and removes each element one by one until the array is good will not work correctly, as it will not take into account the fact that the array must be divisible by 6.
4. **Off-by-one errors.** Off-by-one errors are a common type of error that can occur when programming, and they can often lead to incorrect results. For example, an off-by-one error in the algorithm used to count the number of elements that need to be removed could result in the program removing too many or too few elements.
5. **Memory errors.** Memory errors can occur when a program allocates too much or too little memory, or when it attempts to access memory that it does not have permission to access. Memory errors can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
6. **Synchronization errors.** Synchronization errors can occur when multiple threads or processes attempt to access the same data at the same time. Synchronization errors can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
7. **Race conditions.** Race conditions can occur when two or more threads or processes attempt to access the same data and the order in which they access the data affects the outcome. Race conditions can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
8. **Deadlocks.** Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads or processes are waiting for each other to release a resource, and neither thread or process can continue until the other thread or process releases the resource. Deadlocks can cause the program to crash or hang indefinitely.
9. **Livelocks.** Livelocks can occur when two or more threads or processes are continuously looping, waiting for each other to take an action that neither thread or process will ever take. Livelocks can cause the program to hang indefinitely.
10. **Starvation.** Starvation can occur when a thread or process is repeatedly denied access to a resource, even though other threads or processes are not using the resource. Starvation can cause the thread or process to be delayed indefinitely.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1195_B. Sport Mafia

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong variable type**

The input contains two integers, n and k. It is important to make sure that these variables are of the correct type. In particular, they should be of type `int`, not `float` or `string`. If the variables are not of the correct type, the program will not work correctly.

**2. Using the wrong operator**

The problem states that "the number of candies at the end will be 11". This means that k + 1 = 11. However, if you accidentally use the addition operator instead of the subtraction operator, you will get k + 1 = 12. This will result in an incorrect answer.

**3. Not initializing the variables**

It is important to initialize the variables before using them. For example, if you try to use the variable `n` before initializing it, you will get a `NameError`.

**4. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The problem states that "the number of sweets Alya ate is the number of moves of the first option". This means that you need to count the number of times Alya ate a candy. However, if you accidentally count the number of times Alya put a candy in the box, you will get an incorrect answer.

**5. Using incorrect logic**

The problem states that "the number of candies at the end will be 11". This means that k + 1 = 11. However, if you accidentally use the logic k + 1 = 12, you will get an incorrect answer.

CODEFORCES 1211_F. kotlinkotlinkotlinkotlin...

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the input may not contain a single integer on the first line, or the strings may not be separated by newlines.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is not as described in the problem statement. For example, the output may not contain n different integers, or the integers may not be in the correct order.
3. **Incorrect solution.** The output may not be a valid solution to the problem. For example, the output may not produce the word "kotlin" or a sequence of the word "kotlin" when the strings are concatenated.
4. **Memory limit exceeded.** The program may run out of memory while running. This can happen if the program uses too much memory, or if the input is too large.
5. **Time limit exceeded.** The program may run out of time while running. This can happen if the program is too slow, or if the input is too large.

To avoid these problems, carefully read the problem statement and make sure that your program meets all of the requirements. Also, test your program on a variety of inputs to make sure that it works correctly.

CODEFORCES 1234_D. Distinct Characters Queries

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be in the wrong format, such as a string instead of an integer. This can lead to errors in the program's logic and incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect calculations**. The program may make mistakes in calculating the number of distinct characters in a substring. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as using the wrong algorithm or making a mistake in the implementation.
3. **Memory leaks**. The program may not properly release memory that it has allocated. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
4. **Synchronization issues**. The program may not be properly synchronized, which can lead to race conditions and incorrect results.
5. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may have security vulnerabilities that allow attackers to exploit the program. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as using insecure code or not properly validating user input.

By following good programming practices and testing the program thoroughly, you can help to avoid these problems and bugs.
Test inputs:
```
# Problem: Distinct Characters Queries
# Solution:

s = input()
q = int(input())

chars = set()
for i in range(len(s)):
    chars.add(s[i])

for i in range(q):
    query = input().split()

    if query[0] == "1":
        pos = int(query[1])
        c = query[2]
        s = s[:pos] + c + s[pos + 1:]
        chars = set()
        for i in range(len(s)):
            chars.add(s[i])
    else:
        l = int(query[1])
        r = int(query[2])
        print(len(chars))
```

**Incorrect data type:**

```
s = input()
q = int(input())

chars = set()
for i in range(len(s)):
    chars.add(s[i])

for i in range(q):
    query = input().split()

    if query[0] == "1":
        pos = int(query[1])
        c = query[2]
        s = s[:pos] + c + s[pos + 1:]
        chars = set()
        for i in range(len(s)):
            chars.add(s[i])
    else:
        l = int(query[1])
        r = int(query[2])
        print(len(chars))
```

This program will fail because the input data is in the wrong format. The first line of input should be a string, but the program is expecting an integer. This will cause the program to crash.

**Incorrect calculations:**

```
s = input()
q = int(input())

chars = set()
for i in range(len(s)):
    chars.add(s[i])

for i in range(q):
    query = input().split()

    if query[0] == "1":
        pos = int(query[1])
        c = query[2]
        s = s[:pos] + c + s[pos + 1:]
        chars = set()
        for i in range(len(s)):
            chars.add(s[i])
    else:
        l = int(query[1])
        r = int(query[2])
        print(len(chars))
```

This program will also fail because it is incorrectly calculating the number of distinct characters in a substring. The program is only considering the characters that are in the set `chars`, but it should also be considering the characters that are in the substring. This will cause the program to underestimate the number of distinct characters in the substring.

**Memory leaks:**

```
s = input()
q = int(input())

chars = set()
for i in range(len(s)):
    chars.add(s[i])

for i in range(q):
    query = input().split()

    if query[0] == "1":
        pos = int(query[1])
        c = query[2]
        s = s[:pos] + c + s[pos + 1:]
        chars = set()
        for i in range(len(s)):
            chars.add(s[i])
    else:
        l = int(query[1])
        r = int(query[2])
        print(len(chars))
```

This program will also leak memory because it is not properly releasing the memory that it has allocated. The program is creating a new set `chars` for each query, but it is not deleting the old set. This will cause the program to accumulate memory over time, and eventually it will run out of memory and crash.

**Synchronization issues:**

```
s = input()
q = int(input())

chars = set()
for i in range(len(s)):
    chars.add(s[i])

for i in range(q):
    query = input().split()

    if query[0] == "1":
        pos = int(query[1])
        c = query[2]
        s = s[:pos] + c + s[
Title:
CODEFORCES 1253_C. Sweets Eating

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is not very strict. It allows for multiple spaces between integers, and it also allows for leading and trailing spaces. However, if the input format is not followed correctly, the program may not be able to parse the input correctly and will produce incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is also not very strict. It allows for multiple spaces between integers, and it also allows for leading and trailing spaces. However, if the output format is not followed correctly, the program may not be able to produce output that is accepted by the judge.

**3. Undefined behavior**

The C++ standard does not specify what should happen if a program attempts to access an array element that is out of bounds. This is known as undefined behavior, and it means that the program is not guaranteed to behave in any particular way. In some cases, the program may crash, and in other cases, it may produce incorrect output.

**4. Memory leaks**

A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing. Memory leaks can be difficult to find and fix, so it is important to be aware of them and to take steps to avoid them.

**5. Race conditions**

A race condition occurs when two or more threads attempt to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or even a program crash. Race conditions can be difficult to find and fix, so it is important to be aware of them and to take steps to avoid them.

**6. Deadlocks**

A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can prevent any of the threads from making progress and can eventually lead to the program crashing. Deadlocks can be difficult to find and fix, so it is important to be aware of them and to take steps to avoid them.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1277_B. Make Them Odd

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not correct**

The input format is not correct. For example, if the input is `10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`, the program will crash because it expects the first line to be an integer.

**2. The output format is not correct**

The output format is not correct. For example, if the output is `10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`, the program will crash because it expects the first line to be an integer.

**3. The program does not handle negative numbers correctly**

The program does not handle negative numbers correctly. For example, if the input is `10 -1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`, the program will crash because it tries to divide a negative number by 2.

**4. The program does not handle floating-point numbers correctly**

The program does not handle floating-point numbers correctly. For example, if the input is `10 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0`, the program will crash because it tries to divide a floating-point number by 2.

**5. The program does not handle large numbers correctly**

The program does not handle large numbers correctly. For example, if the input is `10 1000000000 2000000000 3000000000 4000000000 5000000000 6000000000 7000000000 8000000000 9000000000`, the program will crash because it tries to allocate too much memory.

**6. The program does not handle invalid input correctly**

The program does not handle invalid input correctly. For example, if the input is `10 a 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`, the program will crash because it cannot parse the first input as an integer.

**7. The program is not efficient**

The program is not efficient. For example, if the input is `1000000000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`, the program will take a long time to run.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1297_B. Cartoons

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect input format**

The input format for this problem is specified as follows:

```
The first line contains single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. The following are descriptions of the t test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) — the number of cartoons.

In the next n lines, the cartoons themselves are described, one per line, by a pair of integers a_i, b_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9) — the first and last airing days for the i-th cartoon.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values n for all test cases in the input does not exceed 2000.
```

A common mistake that developers make is to not follow this format exactly. For example, they might forget to include the newline character at the end of a line, or they might include extra spaces or tabs. This can cause the input to be interpreted incorrectly, resulting in a runtime error or a incorrect output.

**2. Incorrect output format**

The output format for this problem is specified as follows:

```
Print t answers to given test cases in the order in which they appear in the input: the i-th answer is such x, that only one cartoon will be airing on day x or -1 if there are no such days.
```

A common mistake that developers make is to not follow this format exactly. For example, they might not print the output on a new line, or they might include extra spaces or tabs. This can make the output difficult to read and understand, and it can also cause the output to be interpreted incorrectly by the grading system.

**3. Insufficient test cases**

When debugging a problem, it is important to have a large number of test cases to test your code against. This will help you to identify and fix bugs that you might not have found otherwise. A common mistake that developers make is to only test their code against a few simple test cases. This can lead to them missing bugs that only appear in more complex cases.

**4. Incorrect data type**

The data types of the input and output values for this problem are specified as follows:

* The input values n and a_i, b_i are integers.
* The output value x is an integer.

A common mistake that developers make is to use the wrong data type for one of these values. For example, they might use a float for an integer value, or they might use an integer for a string value. This can lead to incorrect results or runtime errors.

**5. Off-by-one errors**

Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a developer accidentally miscounts by one. This can happen when iterating over a list of elements, or when calculating the size of an array. Off-by-one errors can lead to incorrect results or runtime errors.

**6. Logic errors**

Logic errors are a type of bug that occurs when a developer makes a mistake in their code logic. This can happen when a developer misunderstands the problem statement, or when they make a mistake in their implementation. Logic errors can lead to incorrect results or runtime errors.

**7. Uninitialized variables**

Uninitialized variables are variables that are declared but not assigned a value. This can lead to incorrect results or runtime errors. It is important to initialize all variables before using them in your code.

**8. Memory leaks**

Memory leaks occur when a developer allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing. It is important to free all memory that you allocate in your code.

**2. Incorrect input format**

The input must be a single line of text. If the input contains multiple lines of text, the program will not be able to correctly parse it and will produce incorrect results.

**3. Missing or incorrect instructions**

The program must contain at least one instruction. If the program does not contain any instructions, the program will not produce any output. Additionally, the instructions must be in the correct format. For example, the instruction "H" must be capitalized, and the instruction "9" must be followed by a space. If the instructions are not in the correct format, the program will not produce any output.

**4. Incorrect output**

The program must produce the correct output. For example, the program must print "Hello, World!" if it contains the instruction "H". If the program does not produce the correct output, it will be incorrect.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1446_B. Catching Cheaters

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of substring function.** The substring function in Python takes the start and end index of the substring as arguments. For example, `s[1:3]` returns the substring of `s` starting at index 1 and ending at index 3. However, some developers may mistakenly use the substring function with only one argument, which will return the entire string. This can lead to incorrect results, such as when the developer tries to find the longest common substring of two strings.
2. **Incorrect use of the LCS function.** The LCS function finds the longest common substring of two strings. However, some developers may mistakenly use the LCS function with three arguments, which will return the longest common substring of the first two arguments in the third argument. This can lead to incorrect results, such as when the developer tries to find the maximum similarity score of two strings.
3. **Incorrect calculation of the similarity score.** The similarity score is calculated as 4 * LCS(C, D) - |C| - |D|. However, some developers may mistakenly calculate the similarity score as 4 * LCS(C, D) + |C| + |D|. This can lead to incorrect results, such as when the developer tries to find the maximum similarity score of two strings.
4. **Incorrect use of the max function.** The max function returns the largest element in a list. However, some developers may mistakenly use the max function with two arguments that are not lists, such as when the developer tries to find the maximum similarity score of two strings. This can lead to incorrect results, such as when the developer tries to find the maximum similarity score of two strings that are not the same length.
5. **Incorrect use of the input function.** The input function reads a line of input from the console. However, some developers may mistakenly use the input function with two arguments, such as when the developer tries to read two lines of input at once. This can lead to incorrect results, such as when the developer tries to read the lengths of two strings from the console.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1470_B. Strange Definition

Pain points:
**Possible problems and bugs:**

* **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** This is the most common problem that developers encounter when solving any problem. It is important to carefully read the problem statement and make sure that your implementation is correct.
* **Using incorrect data types.** The problem statement specifies that the input and output should be integers. However, if you accidentally use floating-point numbers, your solution may not work correctly.
* **Off-by-one errors.** These errors occur when you forget to add or subtract 1 from a variable. For example, if you are iterating over an array and you forget to increment the index by 1, you will miss one element of the array.
* **Using uninitialized variables.** This can happen when you declare a variable but do not initialize it with a value. If you use an uninitialized variable, your program may crash or produce incorrect results.
* **Memory leaks.** These occur when you allocate memory but do not free it when you are finished with it. Memory leaks can eventually cause your program to run out of memory and crash.
* **Incorrect use of pointers.** Pointers can be a powerful tool, but they can also be dangerous if you are not careful. Make sure you understand how pointers work before using them in your code.
* **Recursion errors.** Recursion is a powerful programming technique, but it can be difficult to get right. Make sure you understand the base case and the recursive case before writing a recursive function.
* **Synchronization errors.** These errors occur when multiple threads try to access the same data at the same time. Synchronization errors can cause your program to crash or produce incorrect results.
* **Race conditions.** These errors occur when the outcome of a program depends on the order in which two or more threads execute. Race conditions can be difficult to debug, so it is important to avoid them whenever possible.

Title:
CODEFORCES 1497_A. Meximization

Pain points:
### 1. Incorrect use of MEX

The MEX of a set of nonnegative integers is the minimal nonnegative integer such that it is not in the set. For example, MEX(\{1, 2, 3\}) = 0, MEX(\{0, 1, 2, 4, 5\}) = 3.

However, some developers may incorrectly use MEX. For example, they may compute the MEX of a set of negative integers. This is incorrect because the MEX of a set of negative integers is undefined.

### 2. Incorrect calculation of the sum of MEX on prefixes

The sum of MEX on prefixes is the sum of the MEX of each prefix of the array. For example, the sum of MEX on prefixes of the array \{1, 2, 3\} is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

Some developers may incorrectly calculate the sum of MEX on prefixes. For example, they may add the MEX of each element of the array instead of the MEX of each prefix. This is incorrect because the MEX of each element of the array may not be the same as the MEX of each prefix.

### 3. Incorrect use of the sets library

The sets library provides a number of useful functions for working with sets of integers. However, some developers may incorrectly use the sets library. For example, they may try to use the sets library to find the MEX of a set of integers. This is incorrect because the sets library does not provide a function for finding the MEX of a set of integers.

### 4. Incorrect use of the sort function

The sort function can be used to sort an array of integers in ascending or descending order. However, some developers may incorrectly use the sort function. For example, they may try to use the sort function to sort an array of integers in lexicographical order. This is incorrect because the sort function does not sort an array of integers in lexicographical order.

### 5. Incorrect use of the binary search algorithm

The binary search algorithm can be used to find the position of an element in a sorted array. However, some developers may incorrectly use the binary search algorithm. For example, they may try to use the binary search algorithm to find the position of an element in an unsorted array. This is incorrect because the binary search algorithm only works on sorted arrays.

### 6. Incorrect use of the dynamic programming algorithm

The dynamic programming algorithm can be used to solve a variety of problems. However, some developers may incorrectly use the dynamic programming algorithm. For example, they may try to use the dynamic programming algorithm to solve a problem that is not a dynamic programming problem. This is incorrect because the dynamic programming algorithm only works on problems that can be solved using dynamic programming.

CODEFORCES 1546_F. AquaMoon and Wrong Coordinate

Pain points:
**Most important possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:**

1. **Incorrect input format:** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading it in. For example, you might forget to read the number of people and moments, or you might misread the speeds. This could lead to your program crashing or producing incorrect output.
2. **Incorrect calculation of coordinates:** The coordinates of the people at each moment are calculated by adding their initial coordinates and their speeds multiplied by the number of moments that have passed. It's important to make sure that you do this calculation correctly, or your program will produce incorrect output.
3. **Incorrect identification of the modified coordinate:** The modified coordinate is the coordinate of the person that was changed by Cirno. It's important to be able to identify this coordinate, or your program will not be able to find the correct answer.
4. **Incorrect output format:** The output for this problem should be a single line with two integers: the moment that contains the modified coordinate and the original coordinate. It's important to make sure that you format your output correctly, or the judges will not be able to evaluate your solution.

Here are some tips for avoiding these problems:

1. **Be careful when reading the input:** Make sure that you understand the input format and that you are reading the input correctly. It's a good idea to print out the input to make sure that you have it correct.
2. **Double-check your calculations:** Make sure that you are calculating the coordinates of the people correctly. It's a good idea to write out the calculations by hand to make sure that you understand them.
3. **Be careful when identifying the modified coordinate:** The modified coordinate is not always the smallest or largest coordinate. It's important to be able to identify this coordinate, even if it's not obvious.
4. **Format your output correctly:** Make sure that your output is in the correct format. It's a good idea to check the sample output to make sure that you are formatting your output correctly.

CODEFORCES 194_C. Cutting Figure

Pain points:
### Possible problems and bugs ###

1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format for this problem is very specific, and it's easy to make a mistake when reading the input. For example, you might accidentally read the number of rows as the number of columns, or you might forget to put a space between the two numbers. If you make a mistake like this, your program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output for this problem is also very specific. You must print the minimum number of squares that need to be deleted to make set A not connected. If it is impossible to make set A not connected, you must print -1. If you print the wrong output format, your program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
3. **Incorrect algorithm.** The algorithm you use to solve this problem must be correct. If your algorithm is incorrect, your program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
4. **Incorrect implementation.** Even if you have a correct algorithm, you still need to implement it correctly in your program. If you make a mistake in your implementation, your program will not be able to correctly solve the problem.
5. **Runtime errors.** Your program might also run into runtime errors. For example, your program might run out of memory, or it might crash due to a segmentation fault. If your program runs into a runtime error, it will not be able to correctly solve the problem.

### How to avoid these problems ###

To avoid these problems, you should carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand the input and output formats. You should also carefully design and implement your algorithm. Finally, you should test your program thoroughly to make sure it does not run into any runtime errors.

Here are some specific tips for avoiding these problems:

* When reading the input, make sure you use the correct data types for the numbers. For example, if the number of rows is 5, you should read it into an integer variable, not a string variable.
* When printing the output, make sure you use the correct output format. For example, you should print the minimum number of squares that need to be deleted to make set A not connected as an integer, not as a string.
* When designing your algorithm, make sure it is correct. You can do this by testing it on a few small test cases.
* When implementing your algorithm, make sure you do it carefully. You can avoid many mistakes by using a good programming style and by writing unit tests for your code.
* When testing your program, make sure you test it on a variety of input cases. This will help you catch any bugs that might have been missed in your unit tests.

CODEFORCES 267_A. Subtractions

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly followed. For example, the input may contain a negative number, or a number that is too large. The developer should check the input format and handle invalid inputs appropriately.
2. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm that does not correctly solve the problem. For example, the developer may not correctly handle the case where the two numbers are equal.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. The developer may make off-by-one errors when computing the number of operations. For example, the developer may forget to subtract 1 when the two numbers are equal.
4. **Memory leaks**. The developer may not free memory that is allocated during the execution of the program. This can lead to memory leaks, which can eventually cause the program to crash.
5. **Synchronization errors**. The developer may not correctly synchronize access to shared data between multiple threads. This can lead to race conditions, which can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The developer may introduce security vulnerabilities in the program by not correctly handling user input or by not using secure coding practices. This can allow attackers to exploit the program to gain unauthorized access to the system.

CODEFORCES 290_A. Mysterious strings

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input should be a single integer, but the user may accidentally enter a string or a list of integers. This can be caught by using the `int()` function to convert the input to an integer.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output should be a single string, but the user may accidentally output a number or a list of strings. This can be caught by using the `str()` function to convert the output to a string.
3. **Off-by-one errors.** The user may accidentally calculate the output one index off. This can be caught by using the `range()` function to iterate over the correct range of indices.
4. **Indexing errors.** The user may accidentally index the input or output arrays out of bounds. This can be caught by using the `len()` function to check the length of the arrays.
5. **Logic errors.** The user may make a mistake in the logic of the program. This can be caught by testing the program with a variety of inputs and outputs.

Here are some specific examples of these problems and bugs:

* **Incorrect input format:** The user enters the input `"123"`. This will cause the `int()` function to raise an error.
* **Incorrect output format:** The user outputs the string `"123"`. This is not a valid output for this problem.
* **Off-by-one errors:** The user calculates the output as `"AdamsVanBuren"`. This is one index off from the correct output, which is `"AdamsVan Buren"`.
* **Indexing errors:** The user indexes the input array as `input[1]`. This will cause an error because the input array only has one element.
* **Logic errors:** The user assumes that the input is always a prime number. This is not true, and the program will crash if the input is not a prime number.

4. **Incorrect implementation.** Even if the algorithm used to solve the problem is correct, the program must be correctly implemented in order to produce the correct output. A number of common programming errors can lead to incorrect output, such as typos, incorrect variable declarations, and incorrect logic.
5. **Incorrect testing.** It is important to test the program thoroughly to ensure that it is producing the correct output. This can be done by running the program on a variety of different inputs and checking the output. It is also important to test the program for edge cases, such as inputs that are invalid or inputs that produce incorrect output.

CODEFORCES 432_C. Prime Swaps

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for `n` or `a[i]`**

The input specifies that `n` and `a[i]` should be integers from 1 to 105. If you use a data type that is too small, such as `int`, you may overflow and get incorrect results.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem states that you can use the following operation to sort the array:

```
choose two indexes, i and j (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n; (j - i + 1) is a prime number);
swap the elements on positions i and j;
```

If you use an incorrect algorithm, you may not be able to sort the array in the required number of operations.

**3. Not handling corner cases**

The problem specifies a few corner cases, such as the case where the array is already sorted. You need to make sure that your code handles these cases correctly.

**4. Formatting your output incorrectly**

The problem states that you need to print the number of operations in the first line, followed by the operations themselves. You need to make sure that your output is formatted correctly, or the judge will not accept it.

**5. Making a mistake in your code**

Even if you follow all of the guidelines above, you may still make a mistake in your code. It is important to carefully check your code for errors before submitting it.

CODEFORCES 4_D. Mysterious Present

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format is not always strictly followed. For example, the input may contain extra spaces, or the numbers may be separated by tabs instead of spaces. The developer should make sure that the input is correctly parsed.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format is also not always strictly followed. For example, the numbers in the output may be separated by commas instead of spaces, or the output may contain extra spaces. The developer should make sure that the output is correctly formatted.
3. **Incorrect logic.** The developer may make a mistake in the logic of the algorithm. For example, the algorithm may not find the maximum chain size, or it may find a chain that does not satisfy the constraints of the problem. The developer should carefully check the logic of the algorithm to ensure that it is correct.
4. **Memory leaks.** The developer may not properly free the memory that is allocated during the execution of the program. This can lead to memory leaks, which can eventually cause the program to crash. The developer should make sure to free all of the memory that is allocated.

CODEFORCES 525_C. Ilya and Sticks

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data contains a lot of integers, so it is important to use the correct data type to store them. If you use a data type that is too small, you may get an overflow error. For example, if you use an `int` to store a number that is larger than `2^31-1`, you will get an overflow error.

**2. Not handling edge cases**

The problem statement specifies a few edge cases, such as the case where there are no sticks or the case where all of the sticks have the same length. You need to make sure that your code handles these edge cases correctly.

**3. Using incorrect algorithms**

The problem can be solved using a simple greedy algorithm. However, there are other algorithms that you could use, such as a dynamic programming algorithm. If you use the wrong algorithm, you may not get the optimal solution.

**4. Making mistakes in your implementation**

Even if you use the correct data types, handle the edge cases correctly, and use the correct algorithms, you can still make mistakes in your implementation. For example, you might forget to initialize a variable, or you might make a mistake in your logic. It is important to carefully check your code for errors before submitting it.

**5. Not testing your code**

It is important to test your code to make sure that it is correct. You can test your code by running it on some small test cases, or you can use a test framework to automatically generate test cases. By testing your code, you can catch errors that you might not have noticed otherwise.

CODEFORCES 621_A. Wet Shark and Odd and Even

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format for this problem is a single integer n, followed by a newline, followed by n space-separated integers. If the input format is incorrect, the program will not be able to correctly parse the input and will likely crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output for this problem should be a single integer, the maximum possible even sum that can be obtained by using some of the given integers. If the output format is incorrect, the program will not be accepted by the judge.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The algorithm used to solve this problem must be correct in order to produce the correct output. A common mistake is to forget to account for the fact that the sum of two odd numbers is always odd.
4. **Incorrect data type**. The data types used to store the input and output must be correct in order for the program to work correctly. For example, if the input integers are stored as strings, the program will not be able to correctly perform arithmetic operations on them.
5. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to incorrect results, such as the program outputting the wrong answer or crashing.
6. **Indexing errors**. Indexing errors occur when a programmer accesses an element of an array or list using an invalid index. This can lead to the program accessing data that it does not have permission to access, which can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
7. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when a programmer allocates memory for an object but does not free it when the object is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.
8. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads attempt to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to the program producing incorrect results or crashing.
9. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, but neither thread can do so. This can lead to the program running indefinitely or crashing.
10. **Uncaught exceptions**. Uncaught exceptions occur when a program encounters an error that it cannot handle. This can lead to the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

Title:
CODEFORCES 691_A. Fashion in Berland

Pain points:
1. The developer may not understand the problem statement correctly. For example, they may think that the jacket must be fastened by all the buttons except the last one, when in fact it only needs to be fastened by all the buttons except one.
2. The developer may not correctly implement the algorithm to check if the jacket is fastened in a right way. For example, they may not check if the jacket has only one button, or they may not check if the jacket is fastened by all the buttons except one.
3. The developer may not correctly handle the input or output. For example, they may not correctly parse the input, or they may not correctly format the output.
4. The developer may not catch all the edge cases. For example, they may not correctly handle the case where the jacket has no buttons, or the case where the jacket has only one button.

Here are some tips to help you avoid these problems:

1. Carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand it. If you are not sure about something, ask for clarification.
2. Write a clear and concise algorithm to check if the jacket is fastened in a right way. Make sure to handle all the edge cases.
3. Test your code thoroughly with a variety of input data.
4. Use a debugger to help you find and fix bugs.
5. Ask for help from a mentor or peer if you are stuck.

CODEFORCES 850_E. Random Elections

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program. For example, if the input is "3 01010101", the program will expect a string of length 2n = 2 * 3 = 6, but the input string has length 5. This will cause the program to crash.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed, which may lead to errors in the program. For example, if the output is "216a", the program will expect an integer, but the output string contains a letter. This will cause the program to crash.
3. **Incorrect calculation**. The program may incorrectly calculate the probability that there is a candidate who won two rounds. For example, if the input is "3 01010101", the program may incorrectly calculate the probability as 168, when the correct answer is 216. This is because the program may not take into account the fact that the result is always fully determined by the first voter.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program may not free up memory after it is no longer needed, which can lead to memory leaks. This can cause the program to run slowly or crash.
5. **Race conditions**. The program may not be thread-safe, which can lead to race conditions. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may contain security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or SQL injection. This can allow attackers to gain access to the program's data or even take control of the program.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully follow the input and output formats, correctly calculate the probability, and free up memory after it is no longer needed. The program should also be thread-safe and free of security vulnerabilities.

1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format should be exactly as specified in the problem statement. For example, if the problem statement specifies that the input should be a single integer, then you should not input a string or a list of integers.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format should be exactly as specified in the problem statement. For example, if the problem statement specifies that the output should be a single integer, then you should not output a string or a list of integers.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. When computing the answer to a problem, it is important to be careful about off-by-one errors. For example, if you are computing the sum of a list of integers, you need to make sure that you add the first and last elements of the list.
4. **Indexing errors**. When accessing elements of a list or array, it is important to be careful about indexing errors. For example, if you are trying to access the first element of a list, you need to make sure that the list is not empty.
5. **Arithmetic errors**. When performing arithmetic operations, it is important to be careful about rounding errors. For example, if you are computing the square root of a number, you need to make sure that you use the correct rounding mode.
6. **Logical errors**. When writing code, it is important to be careful about logical errors. For example, if you are writing a function to check if a number is prime, you need to make sure that you check all of the possible divisors of the number.
7. **Runtime errors**. When running your code, it is important to be careful about runtime errors. For example, if you are trying to allocate memory for a large array, you need to make sure that you have enough memory available.

Title:
CODEFORCES 920_B. Tea Queue

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the teapot queue**

The teapot queue is a data structure that stores the students who are waiting to get their tea. The queue is implemented as a linked list, where each node stores the student's index and the time they arrived at the queue.

The following code implements the teapot queue incorrectly:

```
class TeapotQueue:

    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None

    def enqueue(self, student):
        new_node = Node(student)
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = new_node
            self.tail = new_node
        else:
            self.tail.next = new_node
            self.tail = new_node

    def dequeue(self):
        if self.head is None:
            return None
        student = self.head.student
        self.head = self.head.next
        return student

```

This implementation has two problems. First, the `dequeue()` method does not check if the queue is empty. This can lead to a `NullPointerException` if the queue is empty when `dequeue()` is called.

Second, the `enqueue()` method does not check if the student is already in the queue. This can lead to a student being added to the queue multiple times.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the student's arrival time**

The student's arrival time is the time when the student arrives at the queue. The arrival time is used to determine the order in which students get their tea.

The following code implements the student's arrival time incorrectly:

```
def get_arrival_time(student):
    return student.li
```

This implementation has two problems. First, the arrival time is not updated when the student leaves the queue. This can lead to a student getting their tea before another student who arrived at the queue earlier.

Second, the arrival time is not compared correctly. The arrival time should be compared in ascending order, but this implementation compares the arrival time in descending order.

**3. Incorrect implementation of the teapot's capacity**

The teapot's capacity is the maximum number of students who can get tea at the same time. The teapot's capacity is used to determine when a student gets their tea.

The following code implements the teapot's capacity incorrectly:

```
def get_teapot_capacity():
    return 1
```

This implementation has two problems. First, the teapot's capacity is always 1. This means that only one student can get tea at a time, even if the queue is empty.

Second, the teapot's capacity is not updated when a student leaves the queue. This can lead to a student getting their tea even if the teapot is full.

**4. Incorrect implementation of the teapot's refill time**

The teapot's refill time is the time it takes to refill the teapot. The teapot's refill time is used to determine when a student gets their tea.

The following code implements the teapot's refill time incorrectly:

```
def get_teapot_refill_time():
    return 0
```

This implementation has two problems. First, the teapot's refill time is always 0. This means that the teapot is always full, even if it has not been refilled.

Second, the teapot's refill time is not updated when a student gets their tea. This can lead to a student getting their tea even if the teapot is empty.

Title:
CODEFORCES 948_E. Picking Strings

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect use of the transitions.** The transitions can only be applied to substrings of the input string, and they must be applied in the correct order. For example, you cannot apply the `A -> BC` transition to the string `ABC`, because the first character is not an `A`.
2. **Incorrect handling of the queries.** The queries must be processed in the correct order, and the output must be a string of `1`s and `0`s. For example, you cannot output the answer to the first query before you have processed the second query.
3. **Incorrect handling of the input data.** The input data must be valid, and it must be processed correctly. For example, you cannot process the input data if it contains invalid characters or if the lengths of the strings are not within the specified range.
4. **Incorrect use of the programming language.** You must use the programming language correctly, and you must follow the style guidelines. For example, you cannot use variables that are not declared, and you cannot use incorrect syntax.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** You must handle errors correctly, and you must not let your program crash. For example, you cannot ignore errors that occur when reading the input data.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand the problem. You should also carefully test your code to make sure that it works correctly.
Test inputs:
```
s = input()
t = input()
n, m = len(s), len(t)
q = int(input())
ans = []
for _ in range(q):
    a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
    ans.append(1 if s[a-1:b] == t[c-1:d] else 0)
print(*ans)
```

**Incorrect use of the transitions:**

```
s = input()
t = input()
n, m = len(s), len(t)
q = int(input())
ans = []
for _ in range(q):
    a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
    if s[a-1] != 'A':
        ans.append(0)
    elif t[c-1] == 'C' and s[b-1] != 'B':
        ans.append(0)
    else:
        ans.append(1)
print(*ans)
```

This code incorrectly uses the `A -> BC` transition. The transition can only be applied to a substring of the input string that starts with an `A`. In the first case, the substring `s[a-1]` does not start with an `A`, so the transition cannot be applied. In the second case, the substring `s[b-1]` does not start with a `B`, so the transition cannot be applied.

**Incorrect handling of the queries:**

```
s = input()
t = input()
n, m = len(s), len(t)
q = int(input())
ans = []
for _ in range(q):
    a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
    if s[a-1:b] == t[c-1:d]:
        ans.append(1)
    else:
        ans.append(0)
print(*ans)
```

This code incorrectly handles the queries. The queries must be processed in the correct order, but this code processes them in an arbitrary order. This can lead to incorrect results.

**Incorrect handling of the input data:**

```
s = input()
t = input()
n, m = len(s), len(t)
q = int(input())
ans = []
for _ in range(q):
    a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
    if 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= n and 1 <= c <= m and 1 <= d <= m:
        if s[a-1:b] == t[c-1:d]:
            ans.append(1)
        else:
            ans.append(0)
    else:
        ans.append(-1)
print(*ans)
```

This code incorrectly handles the input data. The input data must be valid, but this code does not check for invalid input data. This can lead to incorrect results or errors.

**Incorrect use of the programming language:**

```
s = input()
t = input()
n, m = len(s), len(t)
q = int(input())
ans = []
for _ in range(q):
    a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
    if 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= n and 1 <= c <= m and 1 <= d <= m:
        if s[a-1:b] == t[c-1:d]:
            ans.append(1)
        else:
            ans.append(0)
    else:
        print(-1)
```

This code incorrectly uses the programming language. The code uses the `map()` function to convert the input data to integers, but the `map()` function does not check for invalid input data. This can lead to errors.

**Incorrect error handling:**

```
s = input()
t = input()
n, m = len(s), len(t)
q = int(input())
ans = []
for _ in range(q):
    a, b, c, d
Title:
CODEFORCES 976_E. Well played!

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correctly parsed, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input contains a number with a comma instead of a decimal point, the program may interpret it as an integer and give an incorrect answer.
2. **Incorrect use of variables**. It is important to make sure that variables are used correctly in the program. For example, if a variable is used to store the number of creatures, it should not be used to store the total damage of the creatures.
3. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are a common type of bug that occurs when a programmer forgets to increment or decrement a variable by one. This can lead to incorrect results, such as a program that outputs the wrong number of elements in a list.
4. **Logic errors**. Logic errors occur when the program does not perform the intended operation. For example, a program that is supposed to find the maximum value in a list may return the wrong value if the list is not sorted.
5. **Memory errors**. Memory errors occur when the program does not allocate or free memory correctly. This can lead to the program crashing or giving incorrect results.
6. **Race conditions**. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to incorrect results or the program crashing.
7. **Deadlocks**. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can lead to the program crashing or getting stuck.
8. **Security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities can occur when the program does not properly protect its data. This can allow attackers to access sensitive data or take control of the program.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the number of cars is not between 1 and 2n, or if the number of columns is not between 1 and 50, the program will not work properly.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the number of moves is not a positive integer, or if the moves are not in the correct format, the program will not work properly.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The logic of the program may be incorrect, which may cause the program to give incorrect results. For example, if the program does not take into account all of the constraints on the problem, or if the program does not correctly calculate the number of moves, the program will not work properly.
4. **Memory leaks**. The program may not properly free up memory after it is finished using it, which may cause the program to run out of memory and crash.
5. **Race conditions**. The program may not be thread-safe, which may cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
6. **Security vulnerabilities**. The program may not be secure, which may allow malicious users to exploit the program to gain unauthorized access to the system.

HACKEREARTH bandu-the-saviour

Pain points:
**1. The input format is not specified clearly.** The problem statement says that the input should be "N. Next N lines contain 3 space separated integers X Y R". However, the sample input does not follow this format. It contains only 2 lines, and the first line does not contain the number N.
2. **The problem statement does not specify what to do if a point is inside two or more circular regions.** The sample output shows that the number of active bombs is 9, even though there are only 2 circular regions. This suggests that the number of active bombs is the number of points that are inside at least two circular regions. However, the problem statement does not specify this explicitly.
3. **The problem statement does not specify what to do if a point is on the boundary of a circular region.** The sample output shows that the number of active bombs is 9, even though there are 3 points that are on the boundary of the first circular region. This suggests that the number of active bombs includes points that are on the boundary of a circular region. However, the problem statement does not specify this explicitly.
4. **The problem statement does not specify what to do if a point is outside all of the circular regions.** The sample output shows that the number of active bombs is 9, even though there are 3 points that are outside all of the circular regions. This suggests that the number of active bombs includes points that are outside all of the circular regions. However, the problem statement does not specify this explicitly.

Title:
HACKEREARTH city-and-fireman-vincent

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type for storing the input values.**

The input values in this problem are integers. If we use a data type that is too small to store these values, we may get incorrect results. For example, if we use `int` to store the risk factors, we may get an overflow error when the risk factor is larger than `2147483647`.

**2. Not handling the edge cases correctly.**

The input may contain some edge cases that we need to handle correctly. For example, the input may contain a negative risk factor, or a city that is not connected to any other city. If we do not handle these edge cases correctly, we may get incorrect results.

**3. Making a mistake in the algorithm.**

The algorithm for solving this problem is not trivial. It is easy to make a mistake in the algorithm, which will lead to incorrect results.

**4. Using the wrong data structure.**

The data structure that we use to store the graph can have a significant impact on the performance of our algorithm. If we use a data structure that is not efficient, our algorithm may be slow.

**5. Not using the right libraries.**

There are some libraries that can be used to solve this problem more efficiently. If we do not use these libraries, our algorithm may be slow.

Title:
HACKEREARTH navi-and-maths

Pain points:
1. **Incorrectly computing the maximum P%mod value.** One common mistake is to incorrectly compute the maximum P%mod value. For example, you might compute the maximum P%mod value for a subsequence by simply multiplying the elements of the subsequence and dividing by the sum of the elements of the subsequence. However, this is not correct because the product of the elements of the subsequence may be greater than the sum of the elements of the subsequence, which would result in a P%mod value that is greater than 1.
2. **Not considering all possible subsequences.** Another common mistake is to not consider all possible subsequences when computing the maximum P%mod value. For example, you might only consider subsequences that are contiguous in the array. However, it is possible that the maximum P%mod value is achieved by a subsequence that is not contiguous in the array.
3. **Using an incorrect mod value.** Finally, you might use an incorrect mod value when computing the maximum P%mod value. For example, you might use a mod value of 100 instead of 10^9 + 7. This would result in a P%mod value that is not correct.

To avoid these problems, you should carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand the definition of P%mod and the constraints on the input. You should also carefully consider all possible subsequences when computing the maximum P%mod value. Finally, you should make sure that you are using the correct mod value.

Pain points:
1. The input format is not clear. Is the number of characters in each message always a square number? Is the input a list of strings?
2. The output format is not clear. Should the output be a list of strings?
3. The Caesar Box Cipher algorithm is not described in detail. How do we fill the matrix? How do we read the message column wise?
4. The code is not very efficient. It takes O(n^2) time to decrypt each message.
5. The code is not very robust. It does not handle invalid inputs gracefully.
6. The code is not well-documented. It is difficult to understand what the code does.

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format.** The input format specified in the problem statement is not always followed by the test cases. For example, the input may contain a newline character after the number of test cases, or the number of characters in the message may be greater than 10000.
2. **Incorrect output format.** The output format specified in the problem statement is not always followed by the solutions. For example, the output may contain extra spaces or newline characters.
3. **Incorrect calculation of 1's complement.** The 1's complement of a binary number is calculated by flipping all of the bits in the number. For example, the 1's complement of the binary number 0100 is 1011. However, some developers may incorrectly calculate the 1's complement by subtracting the number from 255.
4. **Incorrect conversion of binary numbers to integers.** The binary numbers in the input are represented as ASCII characters. To convert these binary numbers to integers, the developer must first convert the ASCII characters to their corresponding binary values. Then, the binary values must be concatenated together to form a single binary number. Finally, the binary number must be converted to an integer.
5. **Incorrect decoding of the message.** The message is decoded by converting each integer in the input to its corresponding ASCII character. Then, the ASCII characters are concatenated together to form the message.

To avoid these problems, developers should carefully read the problem statement and understand the input and output formats. They should also carefully verify their calculations and ensure that they are correct.

Title:
ATCODER p02649 Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Programming Contest 2020 - O(rand)

Pain points:
**1. Using the wrong data type**

The input data is a list of non-negative integers. If we use an integer data type to store the numbers, we may get unexpected results. For example, if we have a number 2147483647, and we use an integer data type to store it, the number will be truncated to 2147483647, which is not what we want. To avoid this problem, we should use a larger data type, such as long long.

**2. Using the wrong algorithm**

The problem is asking us to find the number of ways to choose a set of numbers from the given list, such that the bitwise AND of the chosen numbers is S and the bitwise OR of the chosen numbers is T. A naive algorithm would be to enumerate all possible sets of numbers, and check if each set satisfies the two conditions. However, this algorithm is very inefficient. A more efficient algorithm is to use dynamic programming.

**3. Off-by-one errors**

When writing code, it is easy to make off-by-one errors. For example, we may forget to add 1 to a counter, or we may subtract 1 from a index. These errors can be very difficult to find, and they can lead to incorrect results. To avoid these errors, we should be careful when writing code.

**4. Using the wrong variable names**

Using the wrong variable names can make it difficult to understand the code. For example, if we use a variable name like "i" to store a number, it is not clear what the number represents. To avoid this problem, we should use descriptive variable names.

**5. Not handling special cases**

The problem may have special cases that we need to handle. For example, the problem may ask us to find the number of ways to choose a set of numbers from an empty list. In this case, the answer is 0. We should make sure to handle all special cases.

ATCODER p03049 diverta 2019 Programming Contest - AB Substrings

Pain points:
**1. Using an incorrect data type**

The input data is a list of strings. If we use an incorrect data type to store the strings, such as an integer array, we will get a runtime error.

**2. Using an incorrect algorithm**

The naive algorithm for this problem is to iterate over all possible permutations of the strings and find the one that contains the most occurrences of `AB`. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(N!), which is too slow for large values of N.

**3. Not handling edge cases**

The input data may contain empty strings. We need to handle this case correctly in our algorithm.

**4. Using incorrect variable names**

Using incorrect variable names can make your code difficult to read and understand. For example, using `n` to refer to the number of strings instead of `N` can lead to confusion.

**5. Not commenting your code**

Your code should be well-commented so that other developers can understand what it does. This is especially important for complex algorithms.

**6. Making typos**

 typos can cause your code to not work as expected. Be careful when typing your code and proofread it before submitting it.

Title:
ATCODER p03337 AtCoder Beginner Contest 098 - Add Sub Mul

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect comparison:** The developer may compare the values incorrectly, for example, comparing `A + B` with `A * B` instead of `A - B`.
2. **Off-by-one error:** The developer may forget to add or subtract 1 when computing the absolute value of a negative number.
3. **Incorrect typecasting:** The developer may cast a `double` value to an `int` value without first checking if the value is within the range of `int`.
4. **Memory leak:** The developer may not release memory that is allocated dynamically.
5. **Buffer overflow:** The developer may write data to a buffer that is not large enough, causing the program to crash.
6. **Race condition:** The developer may not synchronize access to shared data, causing the program to produce incorrect results.
7. **Deadlock:** The developer may create a situation where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, causing the program to hang.
8. **Security vulnerability:** The developer may introduce a security vulnerability by, for example, allowing untrusted input to be used to construct a malicious program.

Title:
ATCODER p03499 AtCoder Regular Contest 086 - Smuggling Marbles

Pain points:
**1. Incorrect implementation of the tree traversal**

The tree traversal is a fundamental part of solving this problem. If it is implemented incorrectly, the solution will be incorrect. For example, if the traversal does not visit all of the vertices in the tree, then the answer will be incorrect.

**2. Incorrect implementation of the marble movement algorithm**

The marble movement algorithm is another fundamental part of solving this problem. If it is implemented incorrectly, the solution will be incorrect. For example, if the algorithm does not move all of the marbles from the vertices to their parents, then the answer will be incorrect.

**3. Incorrect implementation of the marble counting algorithm**

The marble counting algorithm is the final part of solving this problem. If it is implemented incorrectly, the solution will be incorrect. For example, if the algorithm does not correctly count the number of marbles in the box, then the answer will be incorrect.

**4. Incorrect modular arithmetic**

Modular arithmetic is used throughout the solution to this problem. If it is not implemented correctly, the solution will be incorrect. For example, if the modulus is not used correctly, then the answer will be incorrect.

**5. Incorrect use of floating-point numbers**

Floating-point numbers are used throughout the solution to this problem. If they are not used correctly, the solution will be incorrect. For example, if the floating-point numbers are not rounded correctly, then the answer will be incorrect.

Title:
ATCODER p03814 AtCoder Beginner Contest 053 - A to Z String

Pain points:
* **Incorrect use of `ord()`**. `ord()` returns the ASCII code of a character, which is an integer. If you try to use `ord()` on a string, you will get a TypeError.
* **Incorrect use of `in` operator**. The `in` operator checks if a value is in a sequence. If you try to use `in` on a string, you will get a TypeError.
* **Incorrect use of `len()`**. `len()` returns the length of a sequence. If you try to use `len()` on a string, you will get the number of characters in the string.
* **Off-by-one errors**. When you are counting the number of elements in a sequence, it is easy to make an off-by-one error. Make sure you are counting the elements correctly.
* **Indexing errors**. When you are accessing elements in a sequence, it is easy to make an indexing error. Make sure you are indexing the sequence correctly.
* **Logic errors**. When you are writing your code, it is easy to make a logic error. Make sure your code is correct before you submit it.

Title:
ATCODER p03983 Kyoto University Programming Contest 2016 - Handing out leaflets

Pain points:
**1. Overflow**

The problem asks us to find the maximum number of leaflets Eli-1 and her clones can hand out in total modulo 10^9 + 7. This means that we need to be careful about overflow. For example, if N = 10^9 and C = 1, then the answer is 10^9 + 1 which is too large. To avoid overflow, we can use 64-bit integers.

**2. Incorrect modulo operation**

Another common mistake is to perform modulo operations incorrectly. For example, if N = 10^9 and C = 1, then the answer is 10^9 + 1 which is too large. To avoid this, we can first calculate the answer modulo 10^9 and then perform the modulo operation again with 10^9 + 7.

**3. Incorrect calculation of the number of leaflets**

The problem asks us to find the maximum number of leaflets Eli-1 and her clones can hand out in total. This means that we need to consider the number of leaflets that Eli-1 and her clones can hand out in each generation. For example, if N = 20 and C = 8, then Eli-1 can hand out 20 leaflets in the first generation, and her clones can hand out 8 * 8 = 64 leaflets in the second generation. So the total number of leaflets that Eli-1 and her clones can hand out is 20 + 64 = 84.

**4. Incorrect use of the modulo operator**

The modulo operator (%) is used to find the remainder of a division. For example, if N = 10 and C = 3, then N % C = 1. This means that if we have 10 apples and we divide them into groups of 3, then we will have one apple left over.

In the problem, we need to use the modulo operator to find the maximum number of leaflets that Eli-1 and her clones can hand out in total. This means that we need to find the remainder of the sum of the number of leaflets that Eli-1 and her clones can hand out in each generation. For example, if N = 20 and C = 8, then the number of leaflets that Eli-1 and her clones can hand out in each generation is 20, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, and 4096. The sum of these numbers is 10444. The remainder of 10444 divided by 10^9 + 7 is 4367. So the answer to the problem is 4367.

Title:
AIZU p00359 Dungeon

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not always correct. For example, the input may contain a non-integer number, or the number of enemies may be greater than the board size. The developer should check the input format and raise an error if it is incorrect.
2. **Incorrect output format**. The output format is also not always correct. For example, the output may contain a non-integer number, or the output may be too long. The developer should check the output format and raise an error if it is incorrect.
3. **Incorrect algorithm**. The developer may implement an incorrect algorithm to solve the problem. For example, the algorithm may not always find the minimum cost, or it may take too long to run. The developer should carefully design the algorithm and test it thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and efficient.
4. **Incorrect data structures**. The developer may use incorrect data structures to store the input data or the intermediate results. This can lead to incorrect results or slow performance. The developer should choose the appropriate data structures for the problem and use them correctly.
5. **Incorrect error handling**. The developer should handle errors gracefully. For example, the developer should catch exceptions and print informative error messages.
6. **Incorrect code style**. The developer's code should be well-organized and easy to read. The developer should use descriptive variable names and comments to make the code more readable.

Title:
AIZU p01120 Tally Counters

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect input format**. The input format is not strictly followed, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input format is `4 5
2 3 1 4
2 5 5 2`, the program will crash because the second line contains 4 integers, but the third line only contains 3 integers.
2. **Incorrect data type**. The input data may be of the wrong type, which may cause the program to crash. For example, if the input data is `4 5
a 3 1 4
b 5 5 2`, the program will crash because the second line contains a string `a`, but the third line contains integers.
3. **Incorrect logic**. The program may contain incorrect logic, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, the following code will incorrectly calculate the sum of two numbers:
```
def sum(a, b):
  return a + b

print(sum(1, '2'))
```
The output of this code will be `12`, which is incorrect because the sum of 1 and 2 is 3, not 12.
4. **Off-by-one errors**. Off-by-one errors are common mistakes that occur when programming. For example, the following code will incorrectly print the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence:
```
def fibonacci(n):
  if n == 0 or n == 1:
    return n
  else:
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

for i in range(1, 11):
  print(fibonacci(i))
```
The output of this code will be `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34`, which is incorrect because the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34`.
5. **Memory leaks**. Memory leaks occur when a program allocates memory but does not free it when it is no longer needed. This can lead to the program running out of memory and crashing. For example, the following code will cause a memory leak:
```
def allocate_memory():
  return malloc(1024)

def free_memory(ptr):
  free(ptr)

ptr = allocate_memory()
# Do something with ptr
free_memory(ptr)
```
The problem with this code is that the `ptr` variable is never freed, so the memory that it points to is never returned to the operating system. This can eventually lead to the program running out of memory and crashing.

Possible problems and bugs that a developer may encounter when solving this problem:

* **Incorrectly calculating the number of mismatches.** The expected number of mismatches is equal to the expected number of pairs of cards that are not matched. This can be calculated by multiplying the number of pairs of cards by the probability that a pair of cards is not matched. The number of pairs of cards is equal to `N * (N - 1) / 2`. The probability that a pair of cards is not matched is equal to `1 - 1 / N`. Therefore, the expected number of mismatches is equal to `N * (N - 1) / 2 * (1 - 1 / N)`.
* **Using an incorrect formula for the expected number of mismatches.** The formula given in the problem statement is incorrect. The correct formula is `N * (N - 1) / 2 * (1 - 1 / N)`.
* **Using an incorrect algorithm for calculating the expected number of mismatches.** The algorithm given in the problem statement is incorrect. The correct algorithm is to iterate over all possible pairs of cards and calculate the probability that the pair is not matched. The sum of these probabilities is the expected number of mismatches.
* **Using incorrect data types.** The data types used to represent the number of cards and the number of mismatches must be large enough to accommodate the largest possible values.
* **Using incorrect rounding methods.** The output must be rounded to an arbitrary number of fractional digits, provided that the error is within 10-6.
* **Not handling the end of input correctly.** The input ends with a line that contains a single zero. This line must not be treated as a dataset.

Pain points:
**1. The input may not be formatted correctly.** The input is a list of integers, but it may not be formatted correctly. For example, the input may contain spaces between the integers, or it may contain commas instead of spaces. The developer needs to make sure that the input is formatted correctly before processing it.
2. **The input may not be valid.** The input may contain integers that are out of range, or it may contain non-integers. The developer needs to make sure that the input is valid before processing it.
3. **The developer may make a mistake in their algorithm.** The developer may make a mistake in their algorithm, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, the developer may forget to check for division by zero, or they may make a mistake in the order of operations. The developer needs to carefully check their algorithm to make sure that it is correct.
4. **The developer may not handle special cases correctly.** The input may contain special cases that the developer needs to handle correctly. For example, the input may contain a zero-degree polynomial, or it may contain a polynomial with a repeated root. The developer needs to make sure that they handle these special cases correctly.
5. **The developer may not be able to find all of the solutions.** The developer may not be able to find all of the solutions to the equation f(x) = 0. This could be because the equation has no real solutions, or it could be because the developer's algorithm is not complete. The developer needs to make sure that they are able to find all of the solutions to the equation.

Title:
AIZU p01735 Optimal alpha beta pruning

Pain points:
1. **Incorrect understanding of the problem.** The problem is asking for the minimum and maximum number of times to calculate in leaf nodes, not the minimum and maximum evaluation value of leaf nodes.
2. **Incorrect implementation of the algorithm.** The algorithm should be implemented recursively, and the base case should be when the node is a leaf node.
3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases.** The input should be validated to ensure that it meets the constraints specified in the problem statement.
4. **Incorrect use of data structures.** The data structures used to represent the game tree and the evaluation values should be appropriate for the problem.
5. **Incorrect error handling.** The code should handle errors gracefully, such as when the input is invalid or when the algorithm encounters a problem.

To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement, implement the algorithm correctly, and test the code thoroughly.
